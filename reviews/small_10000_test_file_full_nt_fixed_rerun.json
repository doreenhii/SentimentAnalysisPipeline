{"reviewText": "This book caught my eye, and when I read the sample, I was hooked. The final hook was one other reviewer explaining the unemotional aspect of the book's dramatic swings, because of the method of writing employed. (I have often been accused of being unemotional, or anti-sentimental... which is not true. People show these depths of feeling in many different ways--not all of us are weepers, people...) And The Call delivered. The emotion is there, and it's pretty raw at times, but it's emoted in unexpected ways. The characters cracked me up, felt very real, and the story was believable and at times serious, then light, then laugh-out-loud funny. I really enjoyed the writing style, and although it did take a few pages of adjustment, I was very glad I stuck with it. In the same way that Cormac MacCarthy's writing is at first difficult to take in, this was a little bit tough to &#34;get&#34; until I'd gotten through several pages. I have already recommended this to several people. Made me want to try writing again .", "overall": 5.0}

{"reviewText": "I just received a set of Japanese Hiragana and Katakana flash cards by Glen McCabe as recently revised by Professor Emiko Konomi.  I am really impressed, both by the low price and by the overall quality and value of the set.  The real usefulness of a set like this is in the way it can facilitate the speed and accuracy of character recognition.  I'm looking forward to using it this way.  The cards are plastic coated, so they won't get \"funky\" like the ones I made for myself some time ago.  Each card has a series of words written in kana, which aids in the reading of whole words.  One of the most important features involves a high quality CD that comes with the cards.  Using the CD in conjunction with the cards allows the learner to completely avoid using roomaji, and go directly from the Japanese character to the correct Japanese pronunciation.  The 200 cards include the so-called \"twisted sounds\" as well as the \"voiced\" sounds.  There are also wall charts of the characters, which, sad to say, I still find necessary on occasion.  For the beginner, such charts would be of great value.  I am currently teaching \"Scientific Communication in English\" at the Tokorozawa Campus of Waseda University.  I am a colleague of Konomi-sensei at Portland State University and have also been a student in a Japanese class in which she was the instructor.  She is truly a master teacher, and has used her considerable skills to produce a valuable and useful aid in the flash card set .", "overall": 5.0}

It was a little damp and the wind collapsed it, but my yard is wide open and full of sand/gravel on that side.  I bought some more yellow stakes and we didn't blow away at all this weekend.  The tent also stayed dry under the cover of the trees which was great.  We love that we can fit our queen-size air mattress and 2 sleeping bags for the kids in the back room with plenty of room for storage and moving about.  The &#34;windows&#34; in the front screen room close up to keep the elements out which came in handy during the rain - especially with two young kids and a dog.

{"reviewText": "Lampos deals with very difficult teaching situations in a very practical manner. Using true-life stories from her own experience, she weaves easily applicable educational principles throughout the book --- and she does it painlessly. \"Teaching Diamonds in the Tough\" is devotional in format, but don't let the casual structure fool you. This book has very powerful, sometimes heart-wrenching, stories of troubled children, their struggles and successes. And it presents some of the most workable ideas for teaching students like this that I have ever seen. Our culture is moving so fast in this direction that we are in danger of losing an entire generation if we don't learn how to teach, guide and mentor troubled students with love and acceptance. This book is a great tool for the job.David E. FessendenAuthor ofTeaching with All Your Heart: Bringing Curriculum & Class to Life .", "overall": 5.0}
{"reviewText": "I haven't, of course, read the whole book -- I mean, after all, it is a devotional with 52 entries, so I assume the author expects you to read one a week for a year. But I have read several, all in one sitting -- I couldn't stop myself -- and I intend to dip back into this regularly (maybe weekly, maybe more often). It's a very accessible devotional, and not something you have to work at to read.That doesn't mean I consider it fluffy or frothy -- far from it. Rose Chandler Johnson covers a wide range of topics and bases each devotional entry on a Scripture passage. The passages she chooses are from all over the Old and New Testaments; they are mostly well-known verses, but she manages to bring a fresh perspective to them. She is able to be profound without becoming pedantic or obtuse -- and that is a hard balance to maintain.This would be a great devotional for a new Christian, but even the more seasoned believer will get a lot out of it, despite the fact that it is intentionally light reading. Have you ever read a devotional early in the morning, and just couldn't follow it because the text was too plodding? You won't have that problem with this devotional, but you will still be challenged by it .", "overall": 4.0}

Do I wish at times that he had gone into a point more fully? Of course, but then I would have had to invest far more time in reading the book.

{"reviewText": "I bought this camera bag for my t3i 6 months ago. Originally I had a 17-50mm and a 50mm alongside extra batteries and a lens cleaning kit.When I first started out, it was ok at best.Pros:It held my 50mm, 17-50mm, body, my extra batteries, and a charger, as well as various other things.I especially like the side pockets, perfect for the 'extras' I had in my pocket.There are straps on the bottom, and I occasionally kept a small tripod attached to them, which was nice.The bag shows no signs up wear, and appears to be very rugged.I was able to re-arrange the compartments to hold my gear more securely.Cons:The strap clips don't rotate, so I was constantly having to untangle it.The material is abrasive, so don't rub up against it.The bag isn't exactly super-light. It isn't bad, but it certainly isn't great.I quickly ran out of room as I upgraded my kit.The compartment system is a bit odd. It consists of velcro and padded fabric. It holds things in place fairly well, but it rarely maintains the shape I want, so I sort of have to re-arrange it each time I put lenses back.Way too expensive for what I got.Overall, I thought the bag was very too expensive for what I got. I would suggest investing it a low-key off-brand bag for your camera, and to steer clear of this one.

{"reviewText": "So the screen itself is OK. it is an actual screen. Very grainy though but it does the job. The back of the screen is black so no light is going to pass through it which to some is good to some its not. it is heavy and sturdy and that is the sad part too. The spring or the coil that is supposed to keep the screen rolled up is very very weak. So once I am done using the screen if i roll it up it still drops/rolls down quite a bit. there is a metal or wooden rod that is in the bottom of the screen. It is supposed to keep the vinyl in shape and stretched. This rod is very heavy and the coil can't bear its weight so it unwinds. Defeats the purpose of roll down screens. If the coil worked i would give this 5 stars.The arrangement i have is i have used L brackets to hang this from the wall over my window. The whole idea was to use the screen when needed and else roll it up to let light come through the window. now since its half way rolled down; i cant seem to utilize my window. Anyways the set up is very heavy and i lost the box so cant even return it. but if you have other options i would look elsewhere. This screen is cheap for a reason .", "overall": 1.0}

{"reviewText": "These are fascinating, multi-dimensional novels that can be interpreted in endless ways.  They are fast moving and keep you guessing about where they are going and what it all means.  Just like real life, the devil is in the trivial details, intentional and unintentional misunderstandings abound, and the irony builds and builds.Many comparisons with the masterpieces are possible (Don Quixote, Candide, Madame Bovary, The Awakening, Bleak House, Strange Case of Doctor Jekyll and Mister Hyde).  At the risk of destroying something beautiful, over-simplifying, and generalizing something that is unique, one could say these books capture the decline in morals, family, business, legal, and social relationships in the United States and document an accelerated trend toward fragmentation, alienation, stagnation, and decay.Maybe it's because we were bombarded with political advertisements for months on end and our country seems engaged in one crisis after the next, but I found myself thinking that these novels are an extended metaphor for how our political and social life has disintegrated over the last few decades.Something happened that caused serious distrust and a change in values.  It is hard to say what it was (the Vietnam War, Watergate, women's lib, birth control, Bill Clinton's Presidency, etc.), but it happened, and there is no going back.  The change manifested very quickly, so quickly that one must surmise that it was something that resulted from strong forces that had built up over a long period of time.The Republicans have values which are tradition-based and logic-bound.  The Democrats' values tend towards the emotional and they seem to relish challenging traditional beliefs and practices.  However, both parties are afraid of bringing their conflict out into the open and waging an honest and public war for fear of alienating the voters (kids in the case of this story).The Republicans do not understand the full extent to which their values are fundamentally in conflict with the Democrats.  Since the Republicans want to preserve the most basic traditional value of civility (bi-partisanship), they are routinely manipulated and co-opted into various agreements.  And of course, each of these agreements and attempts to compromise ultimately exacerbate every problem, rather than solving anything.In the process of their long-simmering conflict, the Country's infrastructure and viability have decayed (housing, education, economy, governance, law) and the U.S. has split into two rival camps.  The Democrats and the Republicans have such different values, taste and preferences and they distrust each other so much that they can no longer talk to each other in any meaningful way.  Periodically, they go to the court or to vote, but neither side respects the judgment that is rendered, and both sides skulk off feeling victimized.  They live in separate houses in the same town but never talk to each other, except when they have no choice, and even then it is to conduct or conclude some transaction.Considering that I am recommending these novels to my friends and family, I am disappointed that my description sounds so dull and humorless.  Enjoy them .", "overall": 5.0}

{"reviewText": "This touching, funny book has superb insights into the bodily senses, politics, marriage, academia, and regional subcultures, among many other things.Underneath the funny barbs, this is a loving tribute to Oregon's special mixture of East and West coasters, environmentalists and anarchists, do-gooders and cynics. And mixed in with the hilarious spoofs of college professors, there are wonderful meditations on what it means to get the insider's point of view. The particular focus is a young politics professor's attempt to get inside the minds of local anarchists, but the insights into this vexed enterprise apply to much of the contemporary world: the vicissitudes of sudden mass movements, celebrities, and scandals, the frantic drive in the mass media and on the internet to uncover everyone's secrets.But of course all this works only because the writing is so good--gorgeous descriptions, attention to sensual details, beautifully evoked scenes and characters. So I'll just end by listing, somewhat at random, a few short examples:...\"[He was] divorced for the flair with which he shined his shoes.\"Joey (mother to son): \"I hope Oregon isn't like Israel.\"Sequoia: \"through the body we reach the spirit, heart, and mind, not the other way around.\"In short, there's a lot going on here .", "overall": 5.0}

{"reviewText": "This game is a developing BETA preparing for final launch very soon. But that does not affect the quality!Pros:No Super Computer Needed: I play this game on an I3 with 2g Ram. The settings i have are set to Low, there is an ULTRA low.Bring a friend, this game is pure co-opThis game has a never ending war between hundreds of players at once, in land, air, armor, and mechanical beings on maps that are legitimately 250+ square miles across.There is no pressure to buy, you can obtain many things relatively quick.Amazing community: Concerned players, and teamwork. The players i have played with will often heal me, repair me, revive me, work with me, give me ammo, wait for me to get in vehicles, and have taught me tips and tricks with respect. They realize that assisting your comrade is better for you both in the long run, you want as many experienced and alive players with you when the big battles ensue.Men and Women come together in respect: TRUE respect, be you woman or man, the players (at least on Mathersson server) have treated me and mine with respect, just because she is a girl nobody has changed the way they treat her drastically, only for the better.NO WHINING LITTLE CHILDREN: You read that right, i have yet to run into a child in the game who whines or acts like the console community children. Even the kiddies who play the game know that respect is key to win.CONS:Crashes, a few bugs, and weapon \"nerfing\". In Beta stage the game crashes at least once a day, which up to now has not caused any damage to my account other than the vehicle i was in dissapearing. Bugs are present in more than one place. Weapons for many factions have been altered to attempt to balance the game but there is still a big margain to balance.Go big or go home: Planetside 2 can be played casually but the biggest battles last 2+ hours.Need a Fast Internet connection: At least 1 mbps.Game requires patience: Not for the 360 quick scope... the battles are such large scales they take time and strategy to accomplish.

Now I use them for running shoes. I found this pair on amazon for $39.99-at Black Friday. They are hardly worth that money. They look and feel shorter in the front, a lot of the reviews say order a half size bigger, I am now regretting not listening to the reviews. If you are buying a pair on here please consider doing that. Comparing them to my other Sketcher D'Lites they come up way short in my expectations. They are cheaper for a reason. They don't even look as pretty as the ones you look at in stores.  I will update my review in a few months, right now they are a 3 stars to me, if that .", "overall": 3.0}

I can nicely trim my beard and goatee with this trimmer. It is a breeze with this trimmer. it is the perfect size for me to trim. I get a perfect shape every time. There is one thing I don't like, and that is because the hair clogs up everything and it takes quite a while to clean them, but for a trimmer this great it doesn't bother me too much.  I would defiantly recommend this to everyone who is looking for a great trimmer. I can shave and trim my goatee with out taking another three razors in my hand. I can do it all with one styler .", "overall": 5.0}

{"reviewText": "My wife and I both agreed that the best actor in this film was the dog. Having said that, he was an exceptionally gifted dog actor, so it's swings and roundabouts.Plus points: The action sequences are brilliant. Really good, and have much better pacing than in the book where they are somewhat ponderous and muddy in the detail. Also, some of the more laborious bits of the book are left out, so when it does eventually get going (after about the first 70 minutes), it's pretty good.Minus points: The lead guy is a muchness. The lead guy's dad/guardian is cold and unlikeable, pretty much binning the character from the book. The woman playing number six has something of a \"Mid-Pacific\" accent, veering between Australia and the US on a sentence-to-sentence carousel of linguistic wonderment. The whole of the first hour is pretty dull. I was going to say terrifyingly dull, but that romanticises it somewhat - it's just dull.But there is enough going on to keep you interested.

When you can actually get the game to run and finish a game (which is very rarely), the game play is fun and graphics are great but out of the 10 games I played last night I only finished two. The rest of the games ended with generic \"something went wrong\" messages. I am very disappointed in the quality and I am frankly tired of game producers rushing their release dates for shoddy game play. However as I speak new patches are coming in everyday to better the server issues, and as I mentioned before the game, when functional, is fun and worth the $60.00. What you would be getting at this point in time isn't worth $20.00. My advice would be to wait for Black Friday and get a better price and hopefully by then, a better product following all the up coming patches.

I would really like for the series to continue so that we can see what's hidden and what is that screenwriters left for us to discover.Recommend to all, but mostly to CW and SyFy screenwriters, because this is how you make an SF series and not that corn stuff we watch on those networks .", "overall": 4.0}

Also the speakers are better than I was expecting it, it can get pretty loud and the screen is perfect for watching movies, great resolution.One of the best selling points about Toshiba is their extra applications such as the PC Health Monitor, which was a lifesaver on my last laptop it tells you basic info about the CPU temperature, fan speed, battery life status which is a simple way of monitoring the over health of your laptop and tracking its decline.I would say this laptop is best if you are looking for a device to keep up with your internet browsing, watching movies and listening to music and doing moderate use of applications such as MS Office etc. Excellent choice for a student .", "overall": 5.0}

It is a well build case and feels great in the hand. This case is great if you looking to prevent your phone from scratches and are looking for a stylish case but with minimal protect to show off the beauty of your iphone. The back of the case is see through so you can see the apple logo. It is not white on the back as the picture shows. The devise when faced downwards on a smooth surface does not touch the surface but it would be a good idea to get a screen protector as there is very little room from the case to the screen. The only reason i gave it 4/5 is because i feel the case is a little over priced and the picture does show a white backing. I purchased it for $15 dollars when i feel it should have been more like $10 but still definitely worth the money. I would highly recommend this case to anyone looking for a good case with minimal protection .", "overall": 4.0}

I have a Zagg screen protector on my Note II and after having this case on my phone for about 30 minutes my Zagg started lifting and bubbling on one corner. The inside of the case is a little too sharp to have a screen protector. I still blame the Zagg though, I feel it doesn't sit well on the screen (it extends to the edges too much). I really loved this case but, because the Zagg was a $30 purchase, I had to go with another case.

They came packaged as they should, in a box and wrapped in plastic.

BUT that quickly changed! I was sucked into Lilian's life, her thoughts, her struggles, her good times, her bad times, and all of her choices. Her story was so real, and so raw, and I loved every bit of it. It was like I was with her the whole time! When it came to her relationships I was in love with Leo, I loved them together. But I also loved Nick. It's a tough choice but Leo has my heart. He was there for her, he saved her. He is Lilian's happily ending. I was really rooting for Nick and Lil to work, I was kind of jealous she scored a man like that! But everything happens for a reason, and somehow someway Leo and Lil ended up together again after 20 years.Everything that Lil went through hurt my heart, so many highs and lows had me turning the page and turning the page. It was an emotional rollercoaster. Life was good to Lil then it was cruel. They always say you should let these bad times make you stronger but that's not always the case. Sometimes life can hit you time after time and you start to become weak. She dealed with a lot, I felt for her. I sometimes wanted to take some of her pain away.Overall this book was simply great. I was left speechless, I won't be able to pick up another book for a while. It was a rollercoaster of emotions, of pain, happiness and everything in between. It's gritty and so real. This is Lil's story and I know there will be a book 2 with Leo's POV. I would reccemond this read to those who love a good ugly ugly emotional cry .", "overall": 5.0}

Aiden at times was so passive. I felt like he just let the insults slide one too many times. But after all that is his father and they love each other no matter what.

However, I love that I can use many other company's products on it with the adapter set.  I found many many videos on the web for other companies products and how to use them but few on the fuse.  It's pretty simple to use however.  I'm handicapped so the weight tends to be a problem (IT&#34;S VERY VERY HEAVY!!!) but am working around it.  Several of the presses (butterfly, leaf, oval, etc.) are truly beautiful.  I'd sure recommend it, seems like each company has things to recommend theirs, but Fuse will give you the ability to use all their best stuff too so, how could you go wrong .", "overall": 5.0}

{"reviewText": "For the longest time I was beyond words after I started reading this book.It's taken me a few weeks to recompose my senses enough to write this review! But unlike many of the other 1-star reviews, I'm not going to discourage people from picking up this book.Actually, I ENCOURAGE it, so you can see for yourself just how absurd its premises are.  But instead of handing over your $$ to line Amanda Byrne's pocketbook, seriously, please instead check this book out from a library/borrow a copy from a friend/find free passages online.I don't know what is more disturbing... the actual content of the book or the fact that it was even green-lighted to begin with. And Oprah!  Dear beloved Oprah!  How COULD you endorse a book that teaches \"If you see people who are overweight do no observe them but immediately switch your mind to the picture of you in your perfect body and feel it.\"Selling  this to the masses has just as many frightening implications as  \"If you see people who are Jewish do not observe them but immediately switch your mind to the picture of you in your perfect race and feel it\"  (And we all know that the mental \"snuffing\" of Jews didn't just end there....)If you think, \"Well, that's an exaggerated comparison.  Rhonda Byrne is not implying the genocide of fat people\" well think again.  Rhonda Byrne may not be advocating physical genocide but she certainly is advocating the mental kind, encouraging her readers to embrace the US vs THEM mentality...  \"Us\" being the superior, the thinner, the richer (the \"straight\", etc) and \"them\" being anyone who is not \"us\".A person who finds their identity through such a skewed mentality can become so desensitized to \"them\" that violence against \"them\" often can and does erupt, whether it is the murder of one..... or 6 million.And to think, regarding \"\"events in history where masses of lives were lost,\"  The Secret has the audacity to say, \"\"By the law of attraction, they had to be on the same frequency as the event.\"  So, according to the \"law\" of attraction, they basically wished and thought it upon themselves until it became true?!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!(The exclamation points are  a polite summary  of what I was REALLY thinking... I have to keep my review G-rated, you know)Amanda Byrne must have never read Holocaust survivor Elie Wisel's book \"Night\".  Or if she has, she probably did not \"observe\" any of Wisel's horrific written  accounts, and rather envisioned her own \"perfect\"  book and the millions of dollars she would rake in!!!Ahem. Moving on....A quote at the beginning of the same paragraph about weight reads: \"\"Make it your intention to look for, admire, and inwardly praise people with your idea of perfect-weight bodies.\"Is it any wonder, then, that people (mainly women and young girls) end up obsessing over their own bodies and develop eating disorders?Another paragraph from this book which just rubbed me raw was:\"Whether we realize it or not, we are thinking most of the time. If you are speaking or listening to someone, you are thinking. If you are reading the newspaper or watching television, you are thinking. When you recall memories from your past, you are thinking. When you are considering something in your future, you are thinking. When you are driving, you are thinking. When you are getting ready in the morning, you are thinking.\"Gee, I'm not sure I get the point.  Do you think she's trying to tell me that I am thinking?I can't even begin to tell you how completely turned off I was when I read this:\"Everything that surrounds you right now in your life, including the things you're complaining about, you've attracted. Now I know at first blush that's going to be something that you hate to hear.... And I'm here to be a little bit in your face and to say, yes you did attract it\"I'm sorry... even if the \"law\" you are speaking of (on authority, of course) really is 100% fact, if you feel you have to \"get in my face\" to make me believe it, well, then you're insulting my intelligence.  Real experts in real sciences don't HAVE  to get in anybody's face to convince them of anything.  (I've never heard of physicists/scientists/academic professors having to get  in people's faces to prove the law of gravity.)And besides, no matter what point someone is trying to make, whether it be about this so-called law or about something as ordinary as an opinion of a new song out on the radio, if it is expressed along with an \"in-your-face\" attitude, I'm not going to take to the message - even if I happen to agree with it - very kindly.The problem with \"The Secret\" is that the quotes I referenced above are not the only disturbing / damaging / insulting ones to be found.  The book is FULL of them.  Don't believe me?  Read the book to find out for yourself.In conclusion, the only explanations I can come up with for the baffling number of 5-star reviews for \"The Secret\" are:1. Real people are writing about their real experiences with positive thinking, but mistakenly attribute  the positive things happening in their lives  to having read and espoused \"The Secret\" - as opposed to the fact that they actually worked hard for what they got, or they just had plain dumb luck.2. Reviewers actually wrote a negative review,  but didn't realize they accidentally selected 5 stars (if you read the 5-star reviews, you'll see what I'm talking about)3. Shameless investors / promoters of this book have inflated the number of 5-star reviews to pump up salesP.S.  Oprah I love you and I truly believe you the light for so many people.  I hope to see you one day stand up to \"The Secret\"!!  Even if it means having to backtrack your endorsement.  You did it with James Frey, so you can do it with Amanda Byrne .", "overall": 1.0}

{"reviewText": "This was the first novel I read by Jason Gehlert. As with any first time author I read, I am always skeptical of what I am diving in to but do so with an open mind. From the start, Jeremiah captured my attention with a pretty intriguing story line. It is hard to find originality (in my opinion) in a genre such as this but Jason has found gold with this storyline. Making a deal with the Devil sounds like an exotic idea, but the inner demons that are faced as a result of what must be carried out can weigh heavily on a person. I didn't know whether to hate or to love main character Jeremiah Black, and that was the beauty of this book. As the story moves on, you think you know what is coming next and then you are taken in a completely unexpected turn that leads to another great subplot. Just a fun, good paced read that has some pretty interesting twists with each turn of the page. As a first time reader of this author, I cannot wait to see what comes next from this amazing talent .", "overall": 4.0}

I'm still waiting on my order but hopefully it will come in tommorow. I've been out for about a week and I can definetly feel a difference.

{"reviewText": "I received a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review*I&#8217;ll start off by saying thank to the author for allowing me to be one of the lucky people who received an ARC copy of this book. In case I somehow fail to make the point in my review the most important thing to know about this book is that it is really good and if you have not read it yet, you should.One of the things I noticed and liked about the book was the pacing. Normally an author will go slow and set up the story and each character so that you get to know them properly before the conflict of the book starts. While that is a good thing for books that are longer, it also means that for me at least since the good part is hardly in the beginning I am able to put the book down and come back to it later. This one however jumps right into the storyline without feeling rushed.I loved Jenna&#8217;s character. It&#8217;s been a while since I read a book with strong heroine who doesn&#8217;t lose her mind and opinion just because of a guy. Jenna was an independent and strong woman who did not back down to others despite them trying to intimidate her. I mean to go back to the small town where your mom got caught sleeping with the mayor and led you to being a victim of the vicious rumor mill takes some serious lady balls. Another thing I loved about Jenna was her loyalty. Without revealing spoilers, I will say that Jenna&#8217;s attitude towards some people was very admirable despite what was happening. Like I said earlier, she was a strong character who did base her actions on a guy.The relationship between her and Josh I really liked how he did not judge her despite of the rumors. I loved how protective he was of her and although sometimes his actions were misguided at times, I never doubted his feelings for her. Josh frustrated me with how he reacted to some things but it wasn&#8217;t until the end that it all made more sense although I could still not justify what he had done. However his redeeming quality was that he was just caught in a difficult situation and he was trying to do his best to deal with it.My one complain about the book is the length. Now I&#8217;m not sure if it&#8217;s because I'm used to reading 250+ page books that anything under that just seems like too little or that it was actually a little short. But yeah while the story was not rushed at all I would have liked for it to be a little longer and see some interaction between Jenna and other people who weren&#8217;t Josh.As far as the ending is concerned I have to say that I have had my fair share of experience with books where I do not like the ending. Then after a couple of days of thinking about it I will sometimes realize that the author had a good point in ending the book the way that they did (except for you John Green, your endings kill me). This book was no exception, I had mixed feelings about it at first but now I am glad that the author chose to end it that way because it was true to the type of person that Jenna was .", "overall": 4.0}

They  don't have to be played during the reading of the book but I can see that they appeal to kids. My 4 yr old granddaughter enjoyed this book.  As for myself I both enjoyed the story and the layout. Thank you for this great free book. I highly recommend .", "overall": 5.0}

I love that this book  has sparked my and my daughter's imagination. The finished photo of the flowers were great, I've got other books where the photo of finished project was not included and the pattern itself wasn't clear.

{"reviewText": "I'm going to be honest. My love of this game stems mainly from my nostalgia towards it. I opened up this baby on Christmas '03 and from then on it defined my childhood. Let me also be the first to say that this is NOT a genre-defining revolutionary 3-D platformer such as Super Mario 64 or Banjo Kazooie/Tooie, the likes of which it very obviously emulates. It is, at heart, a gigantic fetch quest with only very basic gaming mechanics that anyone who's played the aforementioned games would recognize in a heart beat. All that sounds pretty underwhelming, so why do I like it so much. Well, it's not just nostalgia. The game comes with 13 huge levels to explore, all based directly off of areas from the show. The designers did a perfect job of matching the game world to what we know from the show. Every inch of this game oozes Spongebob, from the sky being decorated with flower clouds, to the absolutely amazing voice-acting. The writing in this game is off the wall hilarious! The music varies from place to place and isn't anything special, it does its job adequately, except for the boss music which is honestly some of the most epic video game tunes I've ever heard. Speaking of bosses, the three main ones are terrific and some of the best I've ever fought. The visuals are not technically the greatest but they fit the art style of the show and you immediately forget the fact that they've aged quite a bit in 9 years. The gameplay is your standard 3-D platforming fare, with added twists (like tongue-boarding) combined with the overall zaniness of each level that keeps things surprisingly interesting. The game itself is relatively easy to get through, but there are some missions that really stand out as very challenging. 100% completion will probably take about 15-20 hours on the first try, so it does have a very good length. But what stands out the most is the developers' love of the show, and it's obvious once you start playing. If you are a fan of the show, this game is a MUST-BUY! No questions asked! It is an interactive extension of the show that manages to pack every bit of joy from the cartoon into a tiny disc and actually do it right. It is NOT a sloppy licensed title by any means, and trust me, Nickelodeon has made TONS of those. This game is a joy to play and it defined my childhood.

{"reviewText": "I really LOVED this book. And there are several reasons:First, good reading. It s very interesting just to read this book - interesting to follow life and development of writer, to know about unique personal experience of Liu PingSecond, very educational. It shows China from completely different point of view. You see from inside all historical events took place in China thrue the eyes of real reagular people who lived them throe. We (westerners - as we are called in the book) don't have real picture of the country, its culture and people. And book of Liu Ping opens your eyes and make you think different. After this book I decided to read more about China - about it's history - so similar and at the same time so different from RussiaThird, very emotional. This book gives you so much positive enegry, fills you with optimism and desire to live your life and fight for your dreams. It motivates you to work hard and study more to improve your professional skills and make personal growth.So, I would stongly recommend this book to everyone who is interested in world history and looking for insperation. And for all who want to read about unique and motivating life story of success .", "overall": 5.0}
{"reviewText": "A highly known skylander in all of the skylander fans, Trigger Happy is back and better than ever in Series 2. You know, this tech-element skylander will never grow old around the world. He came in the Skylanders Spyro's Adventure starter pack ( along with Spyro and Gill Grunt). He still is rocking with his golden pistols and safes. His pistol and safe path are the same, but he has an awesome wow-pow power now. While using the golden machine gun, press the primary attack to fire out a mega blast.Even if you already have Series 1 Trigger Happy , you should buy this one to ( I'm not crazy people). Overall he is like the best one so far in the tech element ( my opinion). Leave comments or questions on Skylanders Giants .", "overall": 5.0}
{"reviewText": "Chill is a water skylander, which means she can swim in water (unless you can fly over it). Overall, she is very speedy in the game and has a good long range attack throwing a ice spear. Although, her figure is fragile and she dies easily if it is against a bark demon or a arkean sniper. Basic thing is, the spear does everything. If you don't get the spear path, you'd do 14 damage. But if you did, it would do over 20 damage. At first she looked well, bad, but when i found out her catch phrase was \"Stay cool\" , well that got me. So it might not be that bad if you bought her at least she isn't like drobot. Come one people lightcore is only 12.99 while normal is 9.99. I hope you like my review. Leave any comments or questions about Skylanders Giants. :- .", "overall": 5.0}
{"reviewText": "Is it a yeti or an ice man? No its the fierce yeti of the water element, Slam Bam. Despite not being a giant, Slam Bam is one power house with his four arms. He'll devastate anything in his way. This is one must have skylander in your collection. His upgrades paths; his brawler fighter path, and his ice prison path. Both are very good but when you get to his soul gem, you need to find it in Empire of Ice which in this single character pack, does not come with. So you have to buy another Slam Bam with his adventure pack. Overall, you would still be pleased with him throughout the game. I hoped you liked my review.

{"reviewText": "Drobot, the new lightcore character from the tech is not being sold a lot. Why? Well first you can't switch paths, you have to reset it. Anyways, he helps a lot whens its like four Arkeyan Defenders or Axecutioners. His attacks are pretty weak, but his soul gem makes his thrusters damage enemies. Activision really needs to think it again. You know, I thought Activision was going to take a step forward in Skylanders, but didn't. The blasters and bladegear paths don't really make a difference in the character and really I think you can expect more from the giant, Bouncer in this case. I wouldn't say that Drobot is the worst in my conclusion, but that drobot isn't like the rest of the Skylanders. Leave comments or questions on Skylanders Giants. :- .", "overall": 1.0}
{"reviewText": "Another new giant, Bouncer joins the tech element. He has finger pistols kinda like Trigger Happy. He can also fire off rockets from his shoulders. Later in the game, you,ll get an \"I-beam\" (basicly eye lasers). He is a good skylander for long range attacks and as well for button-masher people. He has a path about futher devoloping his rockets (which I choose) and one for his fingerguns and lasers. Overall , I think Activision needs to go back to the drawing table and make a change because you should expect more more from a giant than this ( please don't sue me Activision). Well there might be a reason why they did this.

The skirt is at a fair length on me, a couple inches above the knee.  Maybe for someone of my stature it would be nice to have some shorts under, but otherwise, I thought it was really cute.

Luckily, I used a white stamping polish with this.  It works really well, easy to get the hang of even if you're a beginner like me.  I think the seller should give us the choice to buy pink or white bottom separately, instead of having a picture different from the product.  That's the only reason why I gave this 4 stars.

In the information, listed in fine print it does state that the case will hold up to 49 units, but the most insulin I could get into my syringe, and be able to fit inside the case was 48 units of insulin, again it's a good idea, but the case should be about an 1/8\" longer to accommodate a full 50 unit syringe, again the information states that it fits my size syringe, and it does, but it will not accommodate the full length of my syringe when filled with insulin to it's full 50 units capacity, the case will only accommodate a syringe with up to 48 units of insulin.  I am thinking about drilling a small hole in the end of the carrying case, which then would allow me to fill my syringe to the full 50 units of insulin I need. I do recommend this Pre-filled Syringe Carrying Case, but it does need to be about 1/8\" longer, so I can only give it a (3* Rating).Note: Update - I was using a BD 1/2 cc syringe which at full capacity holds 50 units of insulin, and it would not fit the case it was too long when full, so I upgraded to the next larger diameter syringe, a BD 1 cc capacity, and it holds my full 50 unites of insulin, and fit's the pen case without any problem. \"Syringe fit Problem Solved .", "overall": 3.0}

Delivery was fast and arrived on the exact date it stated, the packaging was compact, the instruction manual was short and simple while telling me everything I needed to know, and it came with a warranty card should I want to activate it. I put the battery in, let my phone charge for about 10 minutes before turning it on, and it was at 85%, so I'm guessing it was pre-charged some. It didn't take long at all to get a full charge which I liked since my old battery even in it's newer days took a lot longer to get that 15%.Overall, great quality, exactly what I was looking for, amazing price, and speedy delivery.

{"reviewText": "So here's a REAL  REVIEW. This app does work, there are alot of people complaining about a good app.The Good:  So basically they've got Over a Dozen of there popular shows like Scandal, neighbors, Once. Plus several News programs, both Today shows, 20/20, what would U do &amp; More. For a total of 25 or 30 different programs, maybe more. There are the latest 5 episodes of each able to use watched.The shows clarity depends on your internet speed and your tablet or computer. So the people complaining about it are just cheap. It will stream as good as Netflix or YouTube.Commercials:  Yes you have to watch them but there is one at the beginning of the show and Maybe 2or3 throughout.  You pay $30-100 for cable and have to watch several commercials every 7 mins. This is FREE and there are like 20 less commercials to watch per show. When I was watching nightline there was only one at the beginning.THE  BAD:  I've watched five shows with no problem but one time it did freeze on me. Another time there was a short delay at the very first show I watched there was a 15 or 20 second delay before it startedMY CONCLUSION:  Great Free App , I would pay for it knowing it's this good. I would highly recommend getting. I have a kindle fire HD 7&quot;  I can't guarantee it works with all devices but it sure is worth a shot.  I have gotten other &quot;so-called&quot; tv apps and they didn't let you watch anything. This is different,  download it and you will be happy you did.

That person is Mark Nielsen a 34 year veteran of the Chicago Fire Department, in his book, M Son: Boy. Man. Marine.The book is an honest unpretentious portrait of a father who modesty yet effectively recounts his son's joining the United States Marine Corps, and heading off to war. From the Marine Corps Recruiting Depot in San Diego California, to the long trip to Camp Dwyer in Afghanistan.Nielsen tells of his many long hours of praying with his church, family and friends. Always listening for the telephone to ring, and watching for that six-digit number from his son Scott. Scott informs his father of his last mission with the Thundering Third Battalion Marines, and if possible the next assignment, sometime weeks go by without a call, you can feel the tension.Nielsen gives an insightful firsthand account of the conditions that his son and many other US Marines now live, filthy conditions with no showers, and the afternoon temperatures that reach 110 degrees, as they push forward into the southernmost section of the Helmand Province.Throughout his book Nielsen tries to maintain his life back in Chicago, first with his wife, Scott's mom Margaret a nurse, his son Brett, daughter Jill, and Scott's girlfriend Michelle. Second, he tries to maintain his second family the Chicago Fire Department, as an Assistant Deputy Fire Commissioner, that responds to fires and all other incidents throughout the city of Chicago.The story moves forward with the day to day events that occur in the War, he checks the casualty lists and injury lists, and often wonders how he would be able to handle the worst news a father can get from the United States Marines.A gripping tale of a father and a family that lets his, SON: his BOY.

My brother-in-law's homemade Irish chutney that I brought back to NC following my travels to Maine and Massachusetts.I cozied up this past week in my favorite reading nook in my comfy overstuffed chair complete with an ottoman and a blanket....my nose buried in THE ART OF FLOATING.  Several nights I stayed up past my regimented bedtime simply because I could not put the book down.In my most unbiased opinion (well....maybe I'm a little biased.  I mean she is my sister and all.  Not to mention brilliant, artistic and worldly!) my sister produced a treasured story.  While the power of losing something is often indescribable, my sister puts into words what so many of us are unable to describe.  So vivid, so true and most importantly, so relatable.Just like my brother-in-law's famous chutney straight from his mom's SECRET Irish recipe book, THE ART OF FLOATING is full of mystery and intrigue...with a little bit of spice that make it all its own!  The book combines the power of loss and the glory of discovery AND the process of healing in the face of tragedy.This story is told with a sweetness so tender it will open your heart.  You did it, sis!  THE ART OF FLOATING is truly a work of art that the world should hear.

{"reviewText": "Mabel and  Jack have moved from the comforts of home and family in 1920's Pennsylvania  to take up homesteading in Alaska.  Having given birth to a stillborn child  ten years earlier,  Mabel,  still childless, finds the noisy chatter of children and adult talk of parenthood at family gatherings  painful reminders of her own loss.  Lured by the hopes of a fresh start in the quiet solitude of the Alaskan wilderness, neither she nor Jack are prepared for the harsh realities of trying to survive and make a living there.Late on the eve of the first snowfall,  Mabel  ventures outside.  Jack follows her, and they build  a snow child in the image of a little girl.  They adorn her with scarf and mittens and go back inside. The next morning, Jack is puzzled when he sees the  fleeting figure of a young girl dart through the trees. He is even more perplexed when he notices that the snow child has crumbled and the scarf and mittens are gone.  And it is at this moment that the enchantment begins.In eloquent and vivid detail,  Eowyn Ivey seamlessly weaves together the physical and the ethereal in her updated version of an old Russian fairy tale. Graphic descriptions of the wilds of Alaska magically  transport the reader there, while the story's characters, including the spritely snow child Faina, seem to be as real as  one's next-door neighbors.  Ivey  delivers the story in such a way that the implausible seems plausible, that reality and fantasy are one,  and that anything is possible if you believe in it. If you're looking for a story that  will capture your imagination and touch your heart, don't miss this book .", "overall": 5.0}

{"reviewText": "As a teacher, it's always shocking how little resources exist for teaching about the colonies. However, this book does an excellent job of showing how delicate the relationship was between the Natives and the Americans. It also clearly illustrates the struggles early settlements like Jamestown had in dealing with hunger, disease, and the threat of attack. It's not overly graphic, but death plays a major role throughout the book .", "overall": 5.0}
{"reviewText": "As a teacher, I am constantly looking for books that highlight the struggles our forefathers had in forging this great nation. There are plenty of books that do that job extremely well. &#34;Dear America: The Winter of Red Snow&#34; is an excellent historical fiction book that contains some great details of the hardships of Valley Forge. Rush Limbaugh's book, however, is not a good example.I have no personal bias toward Mr. Limbaugh. Like most pundits, he seems to be spot on at times and wildly irrational at others. There's no denying he's an exceptionally gifted orator, but that doesn't mean he'll smoothly transition into a historical fiction writer. But even if you have never heard of Mr. Limbaugh you wouldn't be able to read this book without wondering if he had a background in politics. Rush's own political views appear frequently throughout the book. This is fine if you are aligned with his views, but if you are trying to teach history from the standpoint of those that actually lived it, then this book will definitely be misleading. It's also a bit inaccurate at times on the roles of key leaders.It also doesn't help the credibility of his book that the image on the cover is the same image used to sell Rush's tea products. (An image that's a bit narcissistic at best). If this is designed to teach, as Limbaugh repeatedly claims, then it shouldn't be an advertisement.If you love Rush, then I ask that you approach the book with caution and understand what it is, a slightly biased, slightly egotistical, slightly stereotypical (at least against the Natives), and slightly inaccurate retelling of the events of the arrival of the Pilgrims. Just as you wouldn't want your hair dresser installing your catheter or your dentist landing a 747, perhaps Rush should stick at the job his excels at and not venture into a world best left to true children's historical writers .", "overall": 1.0}

Then, select which truck delivers animals to your zoo. Score points for animals you bring in, or tickets you sell, but don't overpopulate your zoo.

I hated the two colored gray and blue tiles in the bathroom due to plumbing repair prior to me buying the house not to mention the folding shower door. Yes apparently they made folding shower doors almost 60 years ago. So, I took down the shower door but I did not rip out the old tiles as they were in good shape. They don't make stuff like they used to and a bathroom renovation was not in my budget. I can only examine the cost of demolition of an old bathroom. My brother put this on the tiles which were about four feet or more up the walls of the entire bathroom and higher around the tub. It looks like a new bathroom.  The only difficult part was getting a smooth finish and coverage. He used a small roller at first that didn't give a smooth finish, but I had to buy another and there person at the home improvement store suggested covers that produce a smooth finish. I probably will order another kit, because as it dries you will see areas that don't have enough coverage and the touch kit is too small to cover those areas. Beware of the odor.

{"reviewText": "The book Comforting Children in Crisis was written by Group Publishing Company to serve as a tool in helping every professional who interacts with kids to know what to do in any given situation where a kid is considered in a crisis situation. The sections are organized into a short anecdote and followed by differing tips, depending on the person that tip section is meant for. This method of organization is easy to understand, and makes most sections easy to find.This book has some issues, such as attempting to address everything conceivable that could happen to a kid, instead of focusing on principles. The attempt to deal with twelve different topics in under two-hundred pages makes the book seem more like a list of tips or to dos than a helpful resource. The tips themselves are good, if repetitive at times, but take up more space than anything that is likely to help a person understand the given situation and what they need to do about it, other than a short list of what to say and what not to say and one or two ways to help. Granted, this book is written for the general public, but the differing sections of tips for counselors and other professionals seems almost excessive. Also, it just tries to make things into a cookie-cutter list of actions instead of principles to employ, and is less flexible than would be desired for a usable tool.The negative side being dealt with, this book is an excellent quick-reference guide for anyone who has no clue what to do, and has some good ways to do triage on a kid to figure out who they need to talk to. The main use for this book would be to both remember some guidelines about what&#8217;s happening, and also to give the worker a refresher on each item being addressed.

Ive been section leader and 1st chair for 2 years. Currently a senior in high school.Review:These reeds are EXTREMELY hard to play at first. After my first practice, I was physically exhausted from trying to play. At the time, I could not even play a low D. Gradually I have been adapting to the reeds but they take A LOT of air.Pro:They play a lot louder. (It's probably because it's forcing you to push more air than usual, but still)Articulation is easierDynamics are easierCons:Physically exhausting the first couple of timesRequires a lot more air (This is actually a pro)Very hard to play lower notes (Still working on anything below a low C)A little more difficult to play quieter (Not very noticeable)Conclusion:Don't buy these reeds. If you&#8217;re still in high school, buy a 3 or maybe a 3.5 if you&#8217;re really wanting to switch. I love Vandoren but #4 reeds are a little overkill .", "overall": 4.0}

{"reviewText": "uNu sent me a FREE case for review and believe me, I could not be any happier! I am glad I had the opportunity to participate in the UTry program.The uNu Dx protective case provides full convenience, allowing for an extra full charge of your iPhone, at the same time providing the durability and quality that protects the iPhone 5. The case itself comes in three different colors: white, black, and red. The finishing on the case is a nice a matte, that allows for a smooth and firm grip. It is form-fitted for the iPhone 5 and has cut-outs of all of the ports for easy access.The case provides a 2300 mAh battery, allowing for an extra 100-110% charge. One of the key features of this case is that while charging your phone, it charges the case at the same time. The case also enables syncing, alleviating the problem of taking off the case every time you need to sync onto itunes.In the box, it comes with the case, screen protector, and adaptable headphone jack. The adaptable headphone jack is required for even the use of apple earphones because of how deep the case protrudes from the headphone jack. After using the case for 3 days, I am VERY impressed on the quality of the product. I fulled used all of the battery on my iPhone, and the case still managed to charge it back to 100%. The case does add bulk, but I think this only makes the phone easier to hold. I would fully recommend this case to anyone wanting a quality battery case, that also protects the phone. The only problem that I came across when using the case was that their was NO protrusion from the iPhone screen and the case, so if you face the screen on a table, it would touch the surface. Overall, the case is built great and is a recommended buy!Pros:charges an extra 100-110%durable/protectivevariety of colorscase charges and sync without removal.Great matte finishCons:No protrusion of case to screenAdaptable headphone jack required .", "overall": 5.0}

The movie starts with a horrible story and 5 characters that you can't help but hate. They all complain and they are just irritating and are the kind of people that make me give up on people today. This movie constantly repeats the same thing through the movie. For example they will say something and they will immediately replay it over and over another 2 or 3 times for God knows why, but I know it's incredibly irritating. This movie constantly repeats James Franco's incredibly stupid saying Spring Break, Spring break, Spring break Forever. And this is said more times then the number of times you wish the movie would end. There are not enough words to describe how much I hate this movie. I just don't get how some people enjoyed this. And I'm not bashing it because I have high movie standards. I have seen many bad but enjoyable movies, however Spring Breakers is not enjoyable in any way. It is so bad I am stunned I didn't walk out of this movie. But I gave it the benefit of the doubt and sat through this what felt like a forever long movie and thought something would happen that would redeem it. But nothing happened the ending is just as bad as the rest of this damn movie. And it ends with them repeating the same thing they do throughout the entire movie.

But this book surprised me page after page. Gillian flynn's writing has an absolute new take on how a individual could think about their life partner, so much as that makes you feel a chill running down your spine. In the middle before i reached part two of the book, I didn't know if I should empathize or sympathize with the narrator. Since both the characters take turns on every chapter to have their very own personal view on marriage (which I loved), Gillian knew how to play with her words and form her own visions of dramatization.Since everyone had given their own personal synopsis on the story I wouldn't dwell on it much.It is a dark thriller which makes us question who do we really know in our lives?Can any of us be the true self and not a facade of personalities we try to pretend?Go for it if you like any sort of Dark mysteries .", "overall": 5.0}

KC has done a great job with this badass vampire king who had no feeling of what so ever until he met his bride. I can't wait for the Nix to find her calling.

{"reviewText": "I am 59 and primary cook \"certified foodie\" in the family. My wife has asked me to prepare special diets to keep weight down for both of us at times. My experience has been that while we have kept weight off with South Beach, long term shopping requirements were too intense and unsustainable. The meals were also not satisfying for the level of cooking I enjoy. We would go on South Beach and lose weight, go back to normal schedule and put weight back on and repeat process. The cauliflower \"fake mashed potatoes\" grew pretty weary as a Julia old school French cooking fan. Forget the no wine phase. Great glass of wine after a long day is well deserved. There are several pretty good meals on Doctor Oz such as the tofu tacos and shredded chicken BBQ that really surprised me and are normal weekday new additions worth a Google.About six months ago I started many of the recommendations mentioned in the book before even reading it. I get to keep my passion for trying new dishes with best fresh ingredients but just limited portions. In the past I would eat whatever portion the host or host put on the plate so as not to offend. Now I always tell the host or hostess I am on portion control but want to sample every thing they have prepared.Bottom line, I would rather have a small serving of great food than my previous life where the pounds would add up with no portion control. Add a reasonable level of exercise and I have dropped weight from 180 to 160 in six months and still look forward to dinner!A nice add on to this book might be the best dishes author has tasted in his travels.

{"reviewText": "First off, I am a 20 year old male. This product is simply amazing. I have had it about a week, and used it every day so far. I bought this item in hope to clear up my acne/acne scars. I had little hope when purchasing this item due to the fact that I have tried so many different things to clear up my face. Nothing, and I mean NOTHING comes close to this. Like I said, I use it once a day mixing with water, and leave it on roughly 15 minutes. Your face feels so refreshed after you are done. I noticed results in just a couple days of use. Ladies, and gentlemen there is obviously no &#34;miracle&#34; product out there that will just clear up your acne instantly, but this is about as close as it comes. Well worth the money, and honestly I think it's a steal. I would of payed far more money if I knew how well this product worked. I even let my sister, and mom try it, and they too liked it a lot. So before you go waste your money on stuff like nuetrogena, or clearasil; try this Aztec stuff out. Trust me, it will give you much better results, won't irritate your skin, and it's also healthy for your skin unlike most other face products. Anyways, I am very pleased .", "overall": 5.0}

I just knew that the 1/2hp Badger that was installed now had to go.  It was a 3 bolt style and I was looking at getting this and an adapter.  After reading some reviews, somebody had stated that everything that you need to install the Waste King L-2600 was in the box.  So I ordered the Waste King and some plumbers putty for good measure.  It arrived in 2 days in perfect condition.  I opened the box and looked at the contents.  I was instantly over whelmed.  I read the manual and realized that this was much easier than it looked.  I turned off the breaker for the disposal and started to remove it.  I disconnected the wiring from it and removed the pipe then turned it.  It came right out.  I removed an inner flange then pushed, the 3 bolt bracket was out.  I Cleaned up the sink, connected the E-Z connect flange for the Waste King, lifted the Waste King up and spun, it was in!!  I connected the drain pipe (had to cut an inch off it) easily.  Then I noticed the Waste King has a plug in power cord where as the old Badger was wired directly.  I went to Home Depot and got an easy connect plug for the wire and I was done.  I run the water and had no leaks.  Turned on the power and was amazed at how quite it was.  The one thing to note is the rubber guard that stops stuff from falling into the disposal on accident, also stops food.  This takes a bit of getting use to.Pros: Very easy to install and has everything you need.  Quiet and strong.Cons: Was not prepared for the plug in wire.

I always enjoyed watching anime since 20 years and im 26 now and I think if we had more people that would let there children watch anime we would have less crime in our world more then letting them watch the children programs of today. Plus they would learn better things.

{"reviewText": "I love this game! I thought at first that it would be much like it's sister game \"Diner Dash\", which I also like, but Wedding Dash not only has the character Flo from Diner Dash, and the similarities of having to bring guests their meals quickly, but also the bonuses of getting different guests with their own personalities and preferences. Though this adds its own extra challenges to the levels, which increase in difficulty as you go on, it also personally makes the game more interesting and enjoyable! I've spent many an hour attempting to not only reach the goals needed to pass each level, but also to pass the \"expert\" goal. The free trial gives free levels in one venue, while additional payments unlock different wedding venues. Very addicting and fun game .", "overall": 5.0}

The mounting device broke the first (and last) time I used it. The SD card is fine, as is the USB adapter for the card. The bag, however, is much too small to carry even half of these accessories along with a camera of any size, and both side zippers pop open with even the slightest pressure.

{"reviewText": "I'm one of those women who was blessed with the darkest, coarsest leg hair, which begins to stubble literally as soon as I finish shaving. The second I step out of the hot shower, I get goosebumps and might as well have not bothered shaving at all. So, I have been looking around at other hair removal methods for summertime, but have been intimidated by wax strips of other brands. My sister (who has sparse, blonde leg hair) uses the Sally Hansen strips, and not only does the later redness look painful (it usually lasts a full day), but she has to go back over her legs several times to get even half the hair off. I vowed to never even attempt those!So, I did some intense research before deciding on a product, and these Veet strips seemed to have great overall reviews. Despite my first impression of wax strips, I picked up a box of these yesterday to try. After a bit of stalling, I warmed up the first strip and got ready to wax! It didn't necessarily feel pleasant, but I would call it more of an annoying sting than pain. Keep in mind, this was my first time waxing my legs, so I was probably more sensitive than those who have waxed before. There was virtually no wax left on my legs (just a little where the bottom edge of the strip was placed), and the slight redness lasted less than an hour. I only had to use one clean-up pad per leg, and even that was mostly to see how well they worked (if they got the minimal leftover wax, if they burned at all, if they left my legs shiny like the ad boasted). The pads did leave my legs super smooth and shiny, but my only complaint is that the floral/clean fragrance of them wasn't amazing. It wasn't bad, it just reminded me of my grandmother's perfume. The good thing is that the smell is easily covered with scented lotion. Anyway, this wax kit definitely exceeded my expectations and was easy for a first-timer. I will try to update in the future about the long-term use of these .", "overall": 5.0}

{"reviewText": "Ok, so I don't usually write reviews, but this album is worth my time. Unfortunately, this record is something you probably won't find in your local christian bookstore. It seems as if all the good stuff is independent these days.(Of course, this is only my opinion.) Why won't christian radio take notice of some of these incredible artists who only want to glorify God with their talents? Anyway, I have heard several cuts from Lara Landon's most current album, \"Overcome.\" Beautiful voice. I'm glad she has decided to worship her Creator with it. The sound of that album is more contemporary. This album, in which she collaborated with Magellan is completely different. Completely!! And this is a good thing. The album starts out with a completely original take on the hymn \"Crown Him With Many Crowns.\" For lack of a better word, this is fantastic. The beats are incredible, reminding me of 90's techno. The feel remains about the same throughout the duration of the album. And I must add that their version of \"Awesome God\" is probably my favorite. Don't get me wrong, this is a great worship song. It's just that I've heard so many \"lifeless\" versions.  There is even a small portion of a song that reminds me of a Pink Floyd song. (My pagan days) As I finish writing this I am listening to \"Glow.\"  I probably won't add too much more. This album is refreshing and I can't wait to listen to it this summer with my windows down. (I'm sure I'll look really cool at 40!!) Anyway, buy this album and support these two gifted artists who only want to share the Gospel through Scripture, hymns, worshipful lyrics and music that will most assuredly make the Heavenly Host shake their wings off .", "overall": 5.0}
{"reviewText": "This is Ellie Holcomb's first full length album release as a solo artist. Her first two EP's, &#34;Magnolia,&#34; & &#34;With You Now,&#34; were excellent recordings and left me starving for more from this incredible vocalist. Her first two EP's, by the way, are fantastic. Great voice, great worship,  full of Scripture. Why don't &#34;Christian Record Stores,&#34; or &#34;Christian Radio,&#34; play this stuff?! Why? Because it's not full of a  crunchy contemporary sugar coating. There aren't any tired cliches here or boring musical arrangements. Christian radio isn't for everyone I guess. I prefer independent and more obscure artists. And Ellie Holcomb seems to be just that. The first song, &#34;As Sure as the Sun,&#34; starts out with a vocal gently saying, &#34;There is good news...&#34; Amen to that!! This whole album is great and worth the asking price and more. I won't review every song, as you can preview them and form your own opinion. I will continue with the first song though. Ellie sings, &#34;You could never change, no matter what you do. You are loved, more than you know, more than you could hope for, after everything you've done...&#34; This song is a reminder of God's unending mercy. And I need this song. I need to be reminded that God's mercy chases away my wandering heart, which is forever prone to wander!! The rest of this album is just as solid. Full of reminders of who God is and who we are in light of His Word. (If you are familiar with Leslie Phillips, aka Sam Phillips, you will probably enjoy this album, as Ellie's voice is similar in sound.) So if you're still reading this, stop.

I will not review each song in and of itself because it isn't necessary. This isn't The Cardigans and it isn't A-Camp. This is Nina Persson! With that being said, this is a fantastic record! Her voice is just as soothing as I remember it to be. You can tell her voice has matured and that is a good thing. It flowers some of the songs with a tinge of graceful raspiness. Just a tinge, mind you. In short, I am very excited about this album. Indeed, I hope it does well for her. Hopefully a hard copy will be easier to find real soon. You WILL NOT regret buying this record, so quit reading this silly review and BUY it already .", "overall": 5.0}
{"reviewText": "This whole series has given me just enough to keep reading, but not enough to be satisfied. I basically only read the final book just to see what happened. I was pleasantly surprised that I did enjoy a lot of the book. But the end really fell flat.*Possible Spoilers, but I'll try not to really give anything away*Let's start with the good. The plot is very interesting. This is really what kept me reading. I love Dystopian novels, and the world he created and the mysterious plot was really cool and definitely made me want to read more. I wanted to know more about the world, WICKED, and everything about them. Sadly, when you finally read about what they are doing, it's just not satisfying. Not terribly, but just a bit anticlimactic. I wanted something more. He doesn't explain the reasons behind most of my questions, like why do they have to be put through sooo many awful things, so many deaths, and so many horrible situations? And yet practically nothing good? What was the point of the people being able to speak to each other in their minds? How did this government get so many resources while the world is practically destroyed? He just barely describes what they were doing, but doesn't delve into them at all. Wow... I already set in on the bad of the book...Well here is the rest of what I think is bad..The character development is poor at best, just like the other books. The first definitely had it the strongest, not that it ever was too strong, and the sequels didn't improve. The characters are pretty flat. The interaction and dialogue between characters don't ever seem completely real. This could've been avoided if we were lead to really care about the characters. It's not the weakest character development, but it is one of the weaker parts of this book, and the series as well.I often am finding Thomas to be putting tons of care into some things and characters that I don't feel he should have. I'll try not to give anything away, but when a certain character tells Thomas that he hates him and tells him to leave him alone, Thomas says that it was the single worst feeling he's ever had... Really? There have been countless people dying around him, some that he even really cared about like Chuck from the first book, and he's been lied and hurt and betrayed by other friends and especially the girls... and yet this is the worst feeling he's ever had... I think Thomas has the Flare bad and it's been affecting his brain and his emotions far more than the writer is letting on.*Definite Spoilers*Okay so if you've gotten to the end, here is where I was dissapointed the most. Teresa. She was such a big character in the first book, and even the second. Now she's a nobody. The writer tries to bring back some bit of redemption and some kind of emotional reaction from the reader at the end. But Thomas doesn't seem to care when she gets smashed, and neither did I. Being such a big part of his life I figured Thomas would care a bit more... But nope. And then it was such a letdown. Three whole books of WICKED looking for a cure, and this last book title \"THE DEATH CURE!\" and yet nothing.... LAME! I felt like all these characters, every single one in the book went through this giant adventure and all this pain and suffering all for nothing... And where were they at the end anyways? Nothing explained. Nothing further to understand what's gonna happen to the characters next. I felt like it built up to a strong finale and then just fell down and pitifully ended. Very dissapointed with the end.*End Spoilers*Well yes, rant over. Like I said in the beginning, the book was captivating, kinda. But the end really let me down. I think with a little creativity, and some more effort, Dashner could've made something amazing, especially out of the end. But instead it felt like a first draft that was shoved out into the market .", "overall": 2.0}
{"reviewText": "Well written and creative! Loved the story for the most part.The characters are strong, especially Beatrice. Her thoughts and feelings are strong and the interaction she has with the others works well throughout. The story really drew me in. Seeing the different factions and how different they were and how they interacted was really interesting. How Beatrice overcame obstacles and progressed through the story made me want to keep reading more and more.The story is fast paced, the action intense and keeps you involved.Parts where I think the story could've been better were the character development. I think it was good, but it could've been a lot better in my opinion. I didn't connect with the main character as much as I would've liked to. Not that it was bad, because the character was really good, I just think it could've been better.The ending was okay. The emotions seemed off at the end. I felt it was a bit rushed. That was really the only time in the book when I wasn't connecting with the characters. The ending was left hanging for the next book.  If you're looking for a book that sums up completely, this isn't it. There will probably be a few more on the way. But it's definitely worth it.(Possible Spoilers)I think some parts came too easy to her, like the Capture the Flag game. I felt like it could've been more of a struggle and it would've felt like the victory was more of an achievement. The interactions between her and Four was good, but sometimes I felt like it was lacking. Also I felt like security in the area should've been better. It was far too easy for some of the more evil characters to commit violent acts against each other and get away with it.Overall I loved the book and would recommend it.

This is the one that came out before all those, so it rightfully deserves credibility.  Even if this game wasn't very good, it would still be a must have just to showcase what Sega's dream was, but they perfectly portrayed that dream with the Sonic Adventure.  The story is a little weird at times as in not explaining things not to mention the ending was a bit corny, but who cares?  This game is a LOOOOOAAAAAD of fun.  If you want the ultimate Sonic experience, then you need to have this game.  It cost a little extra to get the original case, but it was definitely worth it.  Alright Sega .", "overall": 5.0}

{"reviewText": "This game gets a 5 out of 5 for several reasons.  One, it looks great.  Whoever designed it obviously thought highly about it and didn't mind poking fun at Pac Man quite a bit, which either works to your advantage or disadvantage depending on scenario.  Pac Man is basically  your pet; you have to instruct him where to go, how to react in situations and help him escape trouble and do Mrs. Pac Man's bidding.  It's a family oriented game, and does not have your typical control scheme.  Pac Man will walk himself and you just point which way to go.  Sometimes Pac man gets scared, happy or sad, and it depends on what you make him do, and how you do it.  I don't know how to classify this game exactly, let's just say it's one of the great ones.  The way I see it it's greatly underrated.  In fact, the only problem I have with this game is how it freezes and resets itself constantly, which I assume is because it's so old.  So, renew this game on some newer models on the Sega Master system, and you're on your way.  Did I mention you can play classic Pac Man on this too? Of course I did.  It gets a 5 out of 5.  If you have a copy, keep it because this game should go into your chronological order of Pac man in Pac Man world. Definitely a fun game .", "overall": 5.0}
{"reviewText": "Alright, so I was looking for a Sega Dreamcast game that would peak my interest enough to get me obsessed with it, and this is one of them.  The music and gameplay is amazing, and the impressive graphics are seemingly flawless for the mystical fantasy rpg style this game has to do offer. Throughout the game you meet characters from different games who you can switch the main charcter with to clear levels.  Levels are caves, condemned buildings and palaces with dungeon chambers on the inside as mazes.  You go from one room to the next fighting enemies and capturing ones at your leisure to train for fighting.  At the end of searching the entire area, you fight a final boss, who you should be able to beat if you've leveled up enough.  It takes good tactic skills to ensure your victory as the game progresses, and knowing what armor to be equipped with.  By the way this game DOES NOT have a good case for armor either because you can collect barely any items without having to drop another one in exchange, then using it, to acquire the next item. You try to preserve and contain your list with healing items, but this in turn requires another sacrifice.  This is one of the only super annoying things about this game; that is the limited  bag to hold items.  You will find yourself repeating some levels over and over again because well, simply put, you weren't strong enough.  See, this game has a certain technique to it that you have to master.  It's called avoid as many enemies as you can unless you know they are weak and will level you up.  Otherwise you're gonna make super progress that amounts to nothing once you die!  What Timestalkers, you never heard of checkpoints?  And why is the main character so annoying?  Otherwise this is a must have classic.

Also, if you analyze the game closely, it really feels more like Resident Evil. I think this game was created before those, and the creators of Resident Evil were inspired.  I feel really satisfied and accomplished playing this game, even if i only got the first disc. all in all there's a total of 4 of them, and it will leave you wanting more.

The graphics are highly stylized in and located in Japan, where you talk to people, ride motorcycles, play arcade games, train, hunt people down, make phone calls and more throughout different towns and villages.  This is just the icing on the cake, but let's say the amazing thing about this game is that it emulates real life so perfectly and on such a deserving system,  It has I believe, 4 disks to it, and I wouldn't dare leave this life without one.

{"reviewText": "I chose 5 out of 5 for this because this game is original, traditional fun.  This is one of the few 3d games for Sonic the Hedgehog that actually satisfies.  A lot of people say it's a rip off of Mario Party, but they're wrong. While it does share a few of the same elements namely because it's a gameboard based platform game, the music and overall experience is totally different. In this you shuffle cards, you don't hit dice.  In this game it's wittier and more intriguing.  It is refreshing and interesting to see how Sega woulda have done it. The intro to the game was nice, the story is fluent, and some of the minigames are a little odd, while providing humor and fun.  There's a bit of button mashing but not an awful lot to hurt your thumb or get sore in your palms, and the controls were developed well.  The levels were pretty kool. I really liked playing on the ship and the train, and in outer space. The other very exciting thing about this game is that when you fight the boss, they still have an actually boss area, with switches you must hit, not to mention that all Sonic's friends (Knuckles, Tails and Amy) get to join.  The boss and story to this game was very odd yet satisfying. Great job Sonic .", "overall": 5.0}

{"reviewText": "The greatest Spiderman game ever made? I don't know about all that.  However, back in the day when we were playing the Nintendo 64, this game was a pretty big deal.  I always wanted to see this game redone with perfected graphics, and the Dreamcast version comes pretty close to it.  I mean, it looks like PS2 basically, and this game started 64 bit.  Nice going, Sega.  You're SpiderMan and of course what does Spidey do? Wall crawl, explore the skylines, beat up baddies, challenge villains, and rescue damsels in distress all the while managing a hectic college life and part time photo journalist.  In this game you save hostages, climb, swing, crawl and explore various levels while encountering different other Super Heroes such as Daredevil, Punisher, and Black Cat.  You fight a variety of Spider Man villains; namely Dr Octopus, Mysterio, Venom, Scorpion, Rhino, thugs and snipers.  It has a lot of beating up and switch finding in it.  Surprisingly the control scheme is alright though a couple spots here and there can be a little confusing as to where you're supposed to go.  It's a classic beat em up game, with original voice casting from the show.  Listening to Stan Lee narrate is always cool, and it has a lot of features from other Marvel characters.  The biggest improvement is the graphics.  They were terrible on the N64.  So if you want a better looking version of this game that has pretty much no control trouble and a fast paced, easy and exciting story to get into, this game is for you.  By the way, the Carnage battle at the end of the game is pretty lame.  So is the run from Dr Octopus at the end.  Just sayin .", "overall": 5.0}
{"reviewText": "If you're a Shadow Man follower like myself, then you know you gotta get this game.  However, it doesn't live up to Shadow Man Senior.  Let me explain.  Shadow Man is a black guy from the city down on his luck after failing his college courses, and squandering his resources with gambling and booze.  When a line of ShaMan and a Voodoo Priestess get mixed up in the line, Mike is transformed into the ShadowMan, Lord of DarkSide, or hell basically.  But with great power comes great missions and ShadowMan is required to collect Dark Souls before A certain demon named Legion does, and create demon humanoids bent on turning the world into a fiery carcass carved out of hell.  This game has tons of blood and gore, and VERY CREEPY sound effects, such as clawing people and pigs squeeling or the detestable screwing and surgery done to an infant somewhere in the back.  You also have to acquire different powers that enable you to do things such as swim in lava, climb walls of wire and coal, climb blood waterfalls and more.  This game is one OF THE BEST GAMES EVER developed.  Control appears a little stiff at least on the N64 version, which also has terrible graphics for this game.  I have heard the PlayStation version is way worse as well.  So, do the smart thing and grab it on Sega Dreamcast!  It's obvious a lot of care was put into this platform, voodoo cursing, biblical testing serial killer chasing game.  So the first one was A BANGER.  What about ShadowMan 2?  There are some cool new elements to it.  I like the fact that Shadow Man is bigger, and the special effects added to him when he enters Deadside is cool.  What is a little irritating are things like not being able to hack through wood with a machete, fighting three or more enemies all at once using unimpressive and unimpressive control scheme for fighting as a human, and dark region areas.  Even brightening the screen didn't do much for me on this game, because you'll still can't see anything. Even if you do manage to reach checkpoints and discover a few new levels and secrets, all in all it's super difficult to advance.  I cannot advance in this game yet, not even with the walkthrough.  By the way, if you find a walkthrough you're lucky like me, because it was almost impossible.  So if you love Shadowman and want to rise to the challenge, go ahead, buy it.  But this game is waaay too hard before it actually gets started .", "overall": 4.0}

I don't think it's ugly, in fact, I think it looks neat and easy to hook up. 3 cords are a little over bearing, but the bigger issue is getting the thing to work. It does not like to work. I'm being so serious. You have to clean it with alcohol and try again and again and again. But hey, it upgrades the Genesis and makes some games sound really good, like Mortal Kombat 2. Great game by the way, though I've heard people don't like it.

For the 16 bit world, it's not bad.  It has some really nice extras in it; the music when you fight Dr. Robotnik is fun to hear, not to mention some of the music from the other levels when you travel through time, and the graphics are nice and colorful. OVERALL HOWEVER, the music comes off as slack, the levels can be dizzying and annoying to tamper with, and Sonic does not have the lovable easy speed mode (you know, where you simply hold the dpad down, and rev up with the \"a\" button? It's more difficult to do in this one.  You have to play it to know what I mean.  Sonic the Hedgehog 2 did this PERFECTLY. WHY NO ONE DUPLICATED THE PERFECTION OF THAT GAME IS BEYOND ME.  Plus, the 3D effects were really too early on to be terribly impressive. This game would have been better perhaps simply as a model for gameplay to come, not as its own independant disc.  Overall, as a Sonic fan I had to buy it, but it's not on my greatest games list.  You gotta be better than the old games Sonic, otherwise, you'll always get slammed.  Now the game is not impossible to get into, it's just that it needs perhaps a better introduction and cut scenes.  Without these the game is not that captivating, though it is a little refreshing to play a Sonic game that requires more accuracy and brainpower in spots such as in Casino levels when your'e bouncing off springs and such. It's really hard to describe the twist and turns in a Sonic game unless you've played it yourself, and most everyone has, and arguably everyone has their own acquired appetite that may be satisfied by this awkward game.  It's not the worst and it's not the best. It's cool to have that extra glitter in the sparkles when you're invincible and it's not like the bosses are too hard to beat, it's just that the past present scheme to the game doesn't feel too significant and the game will trip you out easily with the level designs.

So, what did Jurassic Park have to offer that most games on the Sega Cd don't? For one it has some 3D perspectives that were pretty neat for its time, not to mention the story and quest is solid.  It's nice to hear the Dinosaur Professor teach you things about all the different Dinosaur species.  It didn't rub off on me too well at first, but it eventually grows on you, and if you have a well balanced appetite for old and new things, this game should satisfy to an extent.  The graphics are nice; very well detailed not to mention you get to use several different weapons and interact with a good variety of animals through out the game.  The fun ends there however.  The puzzles you get stuck on in this game are some of the most irritating ones ever not to mention the game takes far too long to reload when you die.  The puzzles are irritating mainly because they are all more so about timing certain sequences and find that \"EXACT spot on the screen.\"  That sort of stuff is what produces migraines!!!  To make matters worse, and to end this review, let's talk about the end of part three on this game.  Once you begin to find the Dinosaur eggs you need and realize they have to go in the incubator, you feel fairly confident you can get through this and finally end this rare and curious adventure. But then the ultimate glitch occurs.  You find after defeating the T Rex that next you go into a cave to pick up Raptor eggs.  You have night vision goggles and finally you can see where the heck you need to go,and it stops there. I even watched the walkthrough, which the player would not answer my question for me (???)  You approach a well where you notice a card you need to open the next door in the proceeding room.  Well, you can't reach the card; you have to throw two rocks in to raise the level, and THEN grab the card. And that's the problem.  There is no second rock in sight anywhere on the game.  I heard that perhaps in the water tunnel the second rock is around, but it's not there either.  So for me, the biggest problem with this game is you CAN'T FINISH IT.  Where the heck is 2nd rock for the well???  The game has nothing more to offer besides a few special effects that were new for the time, interesting facts, and some corky yet entertaining motion video.

Not only did I never hear of it before I watched Angry Video Game Nerd in 2013, but surprisingly, Game Nerd was incorrect when he said this game was not fun to play. Watching stock footage does get a tad bit annoying, but you have to consider this is where all the new games got their ideas from. It's the equivalent to watching a story line for Resident Evil or Final Fantasy.  What's more interesting is how they did it because this was in the year 1993, before the technology was even close to what we have now.  You wouldn't believe how fun it is to watch these ugly zombies creep, run, jump, and fly towards you while you're desperatey trying to switch your ammo to kill shaman and restore your old soldier friends back to normal.  The movie is a lot of fun to watch on this with great one liners and a fake Jamaican and cheesy dumb blonde as a news reporter.  The fact is this game plays like a new video game. The only downside is you'll have to blow and clean your 32 x for what felt like a month before the thing would work.

Since she was a child, she was home schooled on her family land near Orick, California, but when her parents decide to move to Crescent City, she has, for the first time in her life, to go to public school. Her first days at Del Norte High School are difficult, but soon she meets David, the handsome and sweet science nerd and Chelsea. But a hump starts to grow on her back. At first she thinks it's a pimple, her first!, but it grows day by day, becoming difficult to hide. She soon discovers that a flower grows on her back. That's when Laurel is embedded in a tale of magic, intrigue, love and danger where she meets Tamani, a faery, and other evil creatures.Although the start was a bit slow, I could not stop reading from about the fiftieth page. I don't know exactly what happened or what changed, but it gets better. I started and finished it the same night. The idea behind the book is very original. I admit not having read many books about fairies, but the concept seemed pretty original to me. I look forward to learn more about Avalon and fairies in the next novels because we didn't learn a lot in this one.I loved, loved, LOVED Tamani. I think he's the reason why I loved this book so much. His dialogues made me laugh every time and his relationship with Laurel is so much more exciting and intense than the relationship of Laurel and the other guy, I loved every of their scenes when they were together! Their romance was charming. And I loved the end! For those who read the book, you may know why!Something I didn't like was how some characters reacted. The first scene I can think of is when Laurel tells David about her blossom. I found his reaction completely unreal. How could someone be so calm when learning something this strange...Still, it's a novel I recommend. It's an easy, light read, perfect for people who are looking for an entertaining book! I can't wait to read Spells! The book cover is really simple yet cute. After reading it, I can say the wings formed with flower petals fit the story perfectly .", "overall": 4.0}
{"reviewText": "For more of my reviews, visit my blog [...]One year has passed since Laurel found out that she was a faerie. Even if she has come to accept what she is, she refuses to turn her back on her human life. But she is summoned to Avalon and now has to spend the summer to learn everything about magic and the world. Trolls, romance and a lot of information in this book.All these descriptionsIn this book, the author really managed to captivate me with the sceneries. There were a lot of descriptions that really made me imagine the places, without being too much and slow down my reading. But she also managed to leave a little to the imagination. The scene, or rather scenes that come to my mind are when we discover Avalon. All the details and the adjectives Aprilynne Pike used made it looks majestic! I wish I could see this place in real.Finally some detailsWe discover a lot about fairies and their world in this book. It was necessary because we didn't have a lot of information in the first book about any of this. The world is so developed, I loved learning about Avalon, the different types of fairies, how this world works, etc.Some development for the love triangleI  loved what the author did with Tamani and Laurel. Their chemistry is amazing. Tamani says some beautiful stuff in this one, I like him he is passionate and sweet, he would do anything for her. I could feel the tension between them and I want to know what is going to happen with this love triangle! About this love triangle. I don't mind them in a book if it's done right. In this book, it's not about if it's done right or not, but more about Laurel. I loved her in the first book, but I found her terribly cruel with the two boys.Love/Hate relationshipI don't know what to think about Laurel anymore. As I was writing previously, she's cruel. I understand she has conflicted feelings about which one she loves but sometimes she does unnecessary things that hurt one of the two. I also found her careless even after Jamison told her to be careful. While reading, I found myself thinking how dumb she was...I really enjoyed the book even if Laurel was annoying. I can't wait to read the next book in the series and see if my intuition about Klea is right .", "overall": 4.0}
{"reviewText": "Laurel is now in senior year at Del Norte High School. Despite all that happened, she tries to live a normal life. But when Tamani enrols as an exchange student at her school, all becomes even more complicated.In my review of Spells, I was starting to dislike Laurel, I don't know if I'm the only one? Things got worse in this book. It's a pity because it's the only negative thing I have to say about the book, this book was a lot about Laurel's relationship with the two men, I didn't mind it and I loved Tamani as always.I can understand that it's hard to choose between two people you have interest in, but she's bringing it to the next level. Poor David and Tamani! And yeah, she's still acting careless even after what happened in Spells and what Jamison told her. She never learns of her previous mistakes I guess.I loved that some chapters were from Tamani's perspective. I think it made me even more in love with him then before. Laurel must choose him, I'm team Tamani even more then before!But the end&#8230; I want to read the last book now! For the first time in the series, there's a real cliffhanger at the end. I love cliffhangers even if they can be frustrating, especially if the book is not out yet. Luckily, this one is. And I will be reading it soon .", "overall": 4.0}
{"reviewText": "For more of my reviews, visit my blog [...]Calla Tor is a young Guardian of the Nightshade pack. As the alpha of the pack, she always knew one day she would have to mate with the alpha from the other pack, Ren Laroche from the Bane pack, to form a new pack and continue to protect Vail's sacred sites for the Keepers. One day on patrol, she encounters a human boy being attacked by a bear. Against the pack laws, she saves his life and in the process reveals to him the existence of werewolves. But when she sees him at school as a transfer student the next day, she knows everything will change.Love triangles everywhereA love triangle, again. I love it! We have on one side Ren, the handsome alpha male, and on the other side Shay, the beautiful human boy. Who wouldn't want to be in Calla's position and have these two guys after her? I loved the contrast of the two relationships, how with Shay it was sweet and with Ren more intense and physical. They each have something different to offer to Calla. I think I'm team Ren, but I'm not sure yet. I found Calla and Ren to have the same passion and they understand each other because of their position in the pack. And he's the \"bad boy\".Great charactersAndrea Cremer did a great job with her characters. First of all, I liked Calla. I think she's a strong and very loyal heroine. She knows what she wants and she doesn't let anyone tell her what to do. She wants to do her own choices. She's strong enough to tell the handsome and sexy male alpha Ren that she's not one to share with other girls. She also wants to be his equal in leading the pack. She was a bit egoist by moments, but I really enjoyed the book anyway. Ren, Shay, Ansel, Bryn... I also cared for all these characters.Lack of informationI was around page 100 and there wasn't any explications about Keepers, Guardians, Searchers, etc. yet. Luckily, it was easy to understand without these information in the beginning but I think the author should have introduce a little bit of information in the beginning.An amazing cover for a good bookThe book cover (the hardcover one, not the paperback) is just incredibly gorgeous. I love the purple color and the calla lilies at the bottom. I remember being totally in love with this cover when it came out. Overall, the book was good and makes me want to read Wolfsbane but something was missing for me to make it four stars. Maybe because the main focus seemed to be the romance and it's not enough for me .", "overall": 3.0}
{"reviewText": "For more of my reviews, visit my blog [...]We're thrown right into action from the first page. The book begins where we left of in Nightshade. It's packed with information. We learn about Searchers and their world, the real story of the war between Searchers and Keepers and Shay's role in all of this. Even if the pacing was slower because of all the information thrown at the reader, it was necessary, the author had to explain everything before getting into the plot. I loved learning about the truth at the same time as the pack. Some stories surprised me like the one about Ren's mother.Like I said in the review of the previous book, I loved the characters. It was the same in this one. I was anxious to find out what happened to all of them when Calla left at the end of Book 1 because I could very well imagine that it would not be good for them. I can only think of Ansel, Calla's brother...  The new characters introduced in this novel were interesting. I absolutely loved Connor and his humor even when everything was going wrong. His bickering with Silas made me smile. And what happens with Ethan, his evolution, is cute.Overall, it was a good read. I felt like nothing really happened. But the next book will be filled with action that's for sure .", "overall": 3.0}
{"reviewText": "Thethird book is action-packed. If you like action, you will be served in this one! There is almost no break, we go from one place to an other. There is no time to waste before the final battle happens. Between the planning and the hunt for the pieces of the cross, of course there was also a time for romance.Calla is still torn between Shay and Ren. When she's with one, she can't stop thinking about the other. I was a little disappointed with what she did with both men. She acted selfish and it was like she didn't think about their feelings. I think she should have done things differently.The end ruined it for me. I enjoyed the book so much, but I still can't believe what happened. I was really really really disappointed to read how the love triangle ended because it was one of the easiest possible way to do it. That's the worst ending someone could ever imagine. I don't understand why, I just don't.But a good read anyway. I think even with all the disappointed fans, you need to read it to see for yourself. One scene doesn't make the book. I was also pleased to see that Andrea Cremer decided to write a fourth book in the trilogy: Snakeroot and I will definitely read it! I'm intrigued about what it will be about .", "overall": 3.0}
{"reviewText": "Even if her grandfather Lawrence is now back in New York, Schulyer is forced to go live with her uncle Charles Force and his two kids to keep appearances to the eyes of humans. If the interdiction to see her grandfather and Oliver is not enough, Schulyer has to live with Mimi who hates her even more after what happened in Venice and Jack, her forbidden crush, who won't even look at her. The Conclave now knows that what Lawrence always believed is true. When an ancient source of power located in Rio de Janeiro is being threatened by the Silver Bloods, they all have to fly to the exotic city of carnivals and beaches to discover who is behind all this. Conspiracies, secrets and a lot of plot twists!There are a lot of books about vampires out there. This one is different from them. I feel like Melissa de la Cruz did something new and great with this series. What she did with the concept of immortally was really interesting. I never read about something like that. Vampires live a human lifetime then &#34;die&#34; until they are called again on earth. And they have memories of every lifetime. She also did some funny and plausible explanations of the myths about vampires, like why they catch in fire at the sight of sun (it's because they can transform themselves in elements like fire) or why humans believe in such things as soulmates because of twins in the vampire world that are meant to find and be with each other in every lifetime. She also mixed vampires and fallen archangels which I enjoyed.As for the characters, Schulyer is a great heroine. She loves her friends and family and would do anything for them. At first, she's not confident at all and throughout the books, she's becoming more and more confident about her abilities, but also about herself and her appearance. I love when we see an evolution like that with a character, it's essential in a series that characters change after what happen to them. My favourite character is Oliver. At first, I didn't feel like that about him and I wanted Jack to get the girl, but I'm not sure anymore. Oliver and Schulyer have so much in common. He's loyal, even after what he learns around the end, he helps her in Rio de Janeiro. He's perfect for her. But with what was revealed in his Repository file, I'm not sure I want Schulyer to end with either one...There was a lot going on in the third instalment! And the end. The end! I was so stressed with all that was happening! I had so many questions as to what was going on in this book like who is the man in the white suit? What is happening to Bliss? etc. The only thing I could do was guess. A lot was finally explained in the last pages. I had some things right, but there were some plot twists that I never expected. I have so many questions left and the end brings even more of them. I don't know why, but Bliss' parents look shady. What they did with the Watcher was weird, something is going on here, I'm sure of it!I really enjoyed the book and I have the next one on my bedside table, ready to be read. For me, it's the best book of the series so far .", "overall": 5.0}

{"reviewText": "\"Sleep Yourself Beautiful\" is a very very well thought out book. Not only does it give well informed information as to why sleep is important, but it also is a guaranteed hit. It tells you in detail, why sleep is so important. As well as also let you in on a few secrets as to why sleep will actually make you LOOK and FEEL better as a whole.The book goes into great detail about how the term \"beauty sleep\" is not just a random catch-phrase. It is a real thing. With health as the prime concern here, it tells you that sleep is necessary if you want to actually look attractive.My favorite chapter in the book was the chapter \"What Are The Sleep Triggers\" where it actually tells you what the body needs to fall asleep. Coming from a guy with diagnosed sleep issues, this actually hit close to home. We have all had those nights where you simply can't fall asleep, and this chapter actually goes into great detail about how to practically force your body asleep.I write all of this to say, this book is QUALITY. If you are having trouble sleeping, maybe you have been struggling with how your body looks lately, this will give you the confidence that it really is a simple fix, and once you are getting the right amount of healthy sleep, you will not only LOOK great, but you will also be 1000% healthier and might even extend your life .", "overall": 5.0}

I attempted to use it for the first time today and it caught on fire!!! I was using it in a bedroom in a safe outlet that I use for chargers and other items with no issue! It was not around any water! My hair was dry and was using it to help make it straighter. At first it had a smokey smell and I thought maybe this is like a new hair dryer smell. My straightener sometimes smells like this if I use with my hair wet so I thought this was fine. I turned it out waited 5 mins then tried again and luckily I cautiously turned the hair dryer away from hair to make sure it was safe and sure enough fire came out I turned it off unplugged it and it patted it down with a blanket till I stopped. I was sooo scared! luckily I wasn't burned but my blanket had to be tossed! Amazon.com was helpful with processing a return and I still think revlon products are great but something must have been wrong with this particular one so be careful with this .", "overall": 1.0}

{"reviewText": "This candy tasted good but is good only if you do not have any side effects from it. I tried it twice and on both occasions, it caused me massive and incapacitating diarrhea. I do not have lactose intolerance nor any other food allergy. No sure what is contained in these candies that caused me massive diarrhea (12-14 watery stools within next 12-14 hours). Were these infected ? Did they have toxin? Not sure if this batch was defective or generally contains harmful substances. I ate these candies around a year back at which time they seemed to be fine. But this time, they caused me lots of trouble. I am sure that these candies caused my symptoms as I tried nothing new nor did I eat out.  Just had these candies on 2 separate occasions 2 days apart. At the first incidence, I couldn't believe that a candy can cause diarrhea to a non allergenic person so ate it again 2 days after and had similar bouts of diarrhea, this time even worse just a couple of hours after having candies.Pretty sure that these caused the diarrhea. Not to mention that I am pretty tolerant to anything and everything in food. Had no food allergies so far. Won't recommend these to anyone .", "overall": 1.0}

{"reviewText": "This collection of six horror stories is entertaining. Turkish Night is a surreal and violent story about belly dancing competitors. Never Leave Me stars a possessive husband and a ghost, with an interesting twist to the ending that I really liked. In The Painted Staircase, a troublemaker on a museum tour gets more than he bargains for. The Colour of Dishonor is a chillingly different kind of historical horror story with a cruelly dishonorable character who finds himself haunted by his sins. I Dived the Pandora is a scary story about a wreck dive gone terribly wrong. Enjoyable collection .", "overall": 4.0}
{"reviewText": "This is an excellent, well written set of horror stories. The first two are like dark fairy tales. With This Ring has little mazes as illustrations of key plot points. The third story takes a psychological turn. In Losing Dan the question of 'I wonder what they were thinking just before that unthinkable act' is answered. I almost wish it was left unanswered, I had such a strong visceral reaction to this story. The fourth story is about a woman who moves into a literally distressed property. I particularly like the ending. Special mention has to go to the last story in the collection, Flood of Darkness. If the best part of Losing Dan was getting into someone's mind then it is fitting that the final story not only delves into the mind of its troubled narrator but also provides a suspenseful story about a natural disaster. Things get very intense before the completely satisfying end. I'll be looking for more by this author .", "overall": 5.0}

{"reviewText": "Patriot Dawn: It's fantastic for what it is.A novelization of Max's tactical manuals especially CONTACT and (I suspect since i have not read it yet) \"Rapid Fire\".I can tell some people where  a bit unenthused about the plot being a little thin. In my mind that's ok,. don't expect a Tom Clancyuesque yarn but something more valuable instead:A Tactical Manual written as a novel.  Everything he writes is in order to illustrate a tactical lesson he wants to teach.And he has  a lot to teach!I think this may be the best way to learn for many folks who simply can't get themselves to pick up a manual.Even though Max's manuals are not nearly as dry as most, I think this novelization approach may work quite well for many.Sometimes a plot element may seen a little contrived, just keep in mind what it's purpose is. If you want intricate plot twists, well developed characters and brilliant timeless dialogue, look elsewhere.If you want to learn while you read, this is the place.The book is best read using a pen and paper and drawing out the tactical situations as they occur in the book.A Map of Virginia to follow along is also helpful and aids in understanding.Be advised at the end of the book is a index of acronyms common in Combat arms.. check it out before you read.I hope everyone enjoys the book!PS: The plot thickens near the end  and there is a cliffhanger, can't wait until the next book .", "overall": 5.0}

There is a frost like quality or opacity to it. The keyboard cover is silver, not clear. However, I do like the silver keyboard, because it blends in nicely with the aluminum of the computer, and gives it a retro feel. Typing will take a bit of getting used to, but it is a good fit. The case fits nice as well, I just wish it was a little more see through. Another note on the keyboard cover- the power button key is painted with the eject symbol, leading me to believe that its for the Macbook Pro, but, again, to me its not a deal breaker. I am very happy with my purchase, and saved a good amount of money over buying a case and keyboard cover in a store .", "overall": 4.0}
{"reviewText": "Please don't make the mistake I did and buy these thinking that you are getting a good deal...you are NOT. I have never had a problem with dual layer dvd+r disks before, so I also made the mistake of not reading any reviews.I bought the 50 disk spindle (DR8S8B50F/17). So far I have burned through 23 disks with 4 successful writes using DL.These disks have a problem when trying to write to the second layer as they all error at 50%; they will not continue to write. Burning a file a single layer size results in 100% success (I have done this on about 10 disks so far). So instead of a good deal on dl disks, these are rather expensive single layer dvd + r disks.Other info:I use ImgBurn (always have, always will). I have used dl media from Sony, Memorex, and mostly Verbatim with absolutely no errors (unless it was something I caused). I only bought the Philips because they were on sale and I'm always willing to try out new alternatives.I have tried on 3 seperate burners (Sony, LG, Pioneer)...same result (from 4x-8x)I am not going to accept the 'this is a bad batch' nonsense as there should be some sort of QC in place to prevent that.Ultimately, this product is a waste of money. I will never buy anything with the Philips brand again. As has been said time and time again you are better off buying the more (slightly more) expensive disks .", "overall": 1.0}

{"reviewText": "I have been reading reviews,  visited Best Buy,  Verizon,  AT&T,  and few other local stores that sell bluetooth speakers. I have purchased 2 other brands and returned them for poor performance. With all that said... I went to best buy this morning to buy either the bose min or Sony srx5.  I realized to get any reasonable sound quality I had to bump to the $200 price point. While looking a very helpful store attendant asked if I needed help. I noticed these TDK not on their shelf to listen to. I asked if he could open the box for me to just see the size.  He opened the box and the second I held the unit I immediately noticed it's weight (heavy enough to have good components but not to heavy to remain portable).  He then asked if I wanted to hear it.  I took him up on that offer.  Meanwhile the was another customer he had been helping choosing between the Logitech or bose unit.  The store person asked what I liked to listen to and I said journey.  He immediately synced his phone and started a journey track.  I was blown away instantly.  The clarity of the sound,  crystal clear highs and amazing base was shocking to say the least.  I knew I had just picked my speaker.  To my amazement the other shopper ready to buy the bose said \"holy cow\".  My reaction also to this speakers incredibly clear and rich sound.  I grabbed the last one unopened and the other shopper said pack that one back up... I am taking it.  So... Two people bought what I consider a sleepy secret in this overcrowded market of speakers. If you have never listened to this speaker and are looking to purchase any speaker from 150-200 range you absolutely owe it to your ears to find one and hear for yourself. You may just be amazed like I was. After all the looking and reviewing I had done I honestly thought that bose or Sony has the best sound.  I was so wrong.  It had a great speaker phone mic.

Like lots of her books, it can get graphic at times. Not overly so, but the reader definitely needs to be able to be able to picture the crime scene of a horribly murdered young girl. Also the autopsy, and the investigation of her, and other similar murders. For me, that's one of the things that makes her books so great!!!! She really brings the reader into the story. I'm not some sick and twisted serial killer, but, I love reading about them. Especially reading about the combination of the forensics and police work that help catch these people, and get them off the streets. Forensics fascinate me, and this book, has some of that, along with the thrill of the feeling that you're part of the investigation, while safely at home.

{"reviewText": "Higman aims to provide a succinct and abridged history of the Caribbean to a general audience, from pre-Columbian times to the present. Acknowledging first the problems that confront any attempt at coherently defining &#8220;the Caribbean,&#8221; he limits his survey to the island societies of Spanish, Dutch, French, and English heritage, omitting such territories as Florida or the Guyanas.Higman organizes the matter chronologically, starting with a synopsis of the region&#8217;s formative and ongoing geological activity and a brief biogeography. Maps and graphics of prehistoric Ta&iacute;no artifacts are used to help illustrate this &#8220;ancient archipelago.&#8221; Columbus&#8217;s four journeys to the Caribbean introduce consequences of culture-contact and prepare for environmental, economic, and social transformations that become more apparent at the end of the &#8220;second sixteenth century&#8221; (1530-1630). Slavery and its ends on plantations, backed with some demographic considerations, ground Higman&#8217;s brief primer on the two prevailing models of framing the Caribbean &#8211; plural or creole societies. Higman also traces developments from abolition to the present, using the events from the English Caribbean as a guidepost, but notes important departures in the stories of Cuba and Haiti, respectively.This nooks-and-crannies book is a fine reference textbook, and appears to streamline current opinion on the state of research on the region well &#8211; it is a friendly and intelligent digest. Its deliberate omission of in-text documentation, however, is frustrating. Finally, the absence of both the Cayman Islands and Bermuda is puzzling, considering the former&#8217;s proximity to Jamaica and the latter&#8217;s resemblance in form and function to the ABC islands of the Dutch .", "overall": 5.0}

{"reviewText": "\"Child is father of man\". 'Blissful Discontent', a delightful book by Pritha Lal describes a series or epiphanies experienced by her as she took a break from her career to turn into a stay at home Mom, and watched with love as her little Parijat, so aptly named, helped her to find interesting parallels between infant behaviour and the set patterns of work behaviour in adults at their work place. Pritha says that she tried to take notice of things she had known all along \"from a less than three foot tall vantage point and the view has been spectacular.\"Reading Mother Goose rhymes through her pregnancy quietens the \"two year old child with big bug eyes\", denoting familiarity, always a key word in motivation. As she grows, her amazing prowess in knowing close to two hundred words, being bilingual and retaining words with alacrity, are all linked to her parents' constant talking to her. Talking to her, never talking 'down' to her, for children are not balls of mush. They are not ignorant and their minds develop early. Finding clarity through the 'babble' is rewarding and highly motivating.Pritha, the mother, obviously takes precedence over Pritha, the professional, as she talks with pride about herself Parijat using everyday phrases like \"Check it out!\" , \"You did it!\"  and the endearing \"I love you!\", which, of course, she adores. Visual learning reinforces the telling of a subject, be it \"sop sines\" (shop signs) or \"sop sop crowds\" (soft soft clouds). Their little girl has  her favourite toys - get purple stuffed Barney, a pink elephant watering can, fly swatter and the like, and she values the associations attached to each one of them.Comparisons are odious and timely praise motivates. Habit formation takes time and doing things repeatedly with enthusiasm is true motivation. It is these little nuggets of wisdom that Pritha puts across brilliantly in her book, relating them with baby steps taken by her precious daughter. Barney 's influence makes magic words like \"Please\" and \"Thank You\" an essential part of the conversation, and while there are things that can be taught, there are the intangibles like sharing and caring that need to be learnt on one's own.The book ends with Winnie the Pooh's heart warming advice, adapted simply by this amazing writer. \"Remove the fluff. It is so worth it .", "overall": 5.0}
{"reviewText": "There are some books which evoke a sense of nostalgia, passion and love, of raindrops and balmy breezes, of light predicaments and romantic trysts! &#8216;When I See Your Face&#8217; is one of those. It is the story of Cathy, who resolves to start life over, &#8220;without a husband who didn&#8217;t love her and whom she had grown to fear and avoid, if not hate.&#8221; Mark is the scheming charmer who treats her like a possession, and thinks it is his right to abuse her, whenever he is drunk.She falls in love with the picturesque little village that gives her sanctuary, as also with the intrepid Mrs. Grindle, who is like a ray of sunshine, wanting to mother and feed the young girl who has suffered so much.When she meets a stranger, Michael, who is the spitting image of her husband, Mark, her heart skips a beat in panic. The story twists and turns in most interesting ways, keeping the reader wondering as Cathy tries to come to terms with new relationships, which make her feel happy and secure. She concentrates on her own talents, so that she can make a living, all the while overwhelmed by feelings she has never felt before. One evocative line talks of how &#8220;hope was starting to grow inside her, a timid, light green shoot reaching a slim arm out of the soil and into the sunlight&#8221;.What happens when Mark and Michael come face to face?  What are the conflicts that have marred Michael&#8217;s past, and threaten to undermine his present as well? Has Cathy made an error in judgment all over again? Numerous questions tickle the mind of the readers, as events meander by.Devika has a real flair for choosing the right words and phrases to embellish the romance in her story. Never ever is there a moment when the reader feels disappointed in her style, for it remains consistently beautiful and easy to read. There is an innocence in the narrative that tugs at one&#8217;s heartstrings, and an old world charm that is missing in most modern books. It is also a story of progression, as Cathy grows stronger as a person, losing her vulnerability and low self esteem, as she finds herself able to live an independent and fulfilling life.The cover of the book exemplifies the serenity and the deep love within the hearts of the characters. If you love romance, do read &#8216;When I see your Face&#8217;! If you enjoy a twist in your tale, stretch your hand out and pick this book up! And finally, if you want to read something that makes you feel warm and happy inside, this is definitely the book for you .", "overall": 5.0}

There's no comparison at all. Previously, the HMDX Jam Plus was in my opinion the best portable bluetooth speaker, but after using this Sharkk BoomBox i can say that the Sharkk is the best portable bluetooth speaker Period.The reason behind this great sound is the fact that this speaker has two main &#34;High frequency&#34; mini speakers and one &#34;low frequency subwoofer&#34; speaker at the back. The two main in the front provide the awesome distortion free vocals while the one in the back is punching the bass. The combination of both the mini speakers and a the subwoofer provided the best music experience in portable speakers.So, the bottom line is go for it you will never regret it .", "overall": 5.0}

The manufacturer's website has every video you need to easily repair any burned out strand even on outdoor lighted decor.  It also comes with very detailed instructions in the package.  We used it on our pre-lit tree where we had two problems.  One-one strand wasn't burning at all.  My husband simply used the tool as instructed and traced the wiring to the bulb that was causing the problem.  Voila!  No more burned out strand!  And, two-we had one bulb in another strand that was loose.  Once again, it took less than 5 minutes to find the loose bulb and voila...no more problem.  All I can say is that I wish we had this when we donated a pre-lit tree after hours of trying to repair it.

I got the last 3 that were available, and now wish I had ordered enough for all our windows.  I was a little skeptical of battery operated candles since I had others in the past where the batteries only lasted a few days at the most.  The candles performed beautifully...stayed on from dusk until dawn from the day I put them out until I took them down a few days after Christmas (15 days).  I put all the batteries in them at the same time, and made sure to follow the directions so that the on/off sensor was facing out.  I also liked that you can choose between a solid light or flickering or off.  I used the flickering glow since we live in an old farmhouse, and they looked just like candles burning in the window!.  We didn't have any other outside lights to combat the nice light from the candles.  The light is abit dim, so if you're looking for something bright white like most Christmas lights, you might not like these, but I loved them! t I took the batteries out when I packed them away until next year to avoid something switching them back on while they're in storage.  I sent the company a message to let me know when more are in stock.  Hope these become available again .", "overall": 5.0}

It supports my daughter's head well and the plastic isn't flimsy. She falls asleep right away in it too. We didn't use the infant foam as our daughter fit better without it, even with her birth weight at 6lb 8oz and 20.5\" long. It fits in our 1999 Subaru forester in a side position with the base, but the front seat has to be all the way forward and that makes it so no one can sit up there. It fits in the middle back seat without the base. It also fits exceptionally well in our 2002 dodge ram quad cab. We don't have the latch system in our vehicles, so we use the seat belt to install it. Not hard at all. Just have to push the base down and get it tight enough. I highly recommend this seat if you are searching for one. It's not overly heavy and bulky. It's bigger than others, but it's also sturdier. It's definitely not too heavy (I'm only 5'3\", 120lbs and I can carry it easily .", "overall": 5.0}

I wish that the Infant Optics monitor had that option. We have the Infant Optics DXR-5 for our other kid and prefer that one over this.

{"reviewText": "I had the privilege of working with Roger in person as he was developing this book, and I can personally attest to its impact. Through the simple lessons learned through this text, I was able to gain control of my ulcerative colitis for the first time in seventeen years; I was also able to gain muscle tone, lose fat, and start an exercise program for the first time in my life. Roger's clear, insightful, logical, sustainable, and kind approach to explaining WHY certain dietary changes are necessary makes all the difference. There is no yelling, lecturing, jargon, or hype - Roger's writing is engaging, clear, and taps in to both your common sense and the heart of what is holding you back on your path to better health. As a lifelong exercise-phobe, and someone who is skeptical about &#34;fad&#34; diets, I found Roger's approach to both movement and eating to make it easy and feasible to make changes that I believed in, without having to force myself to believe in things I didn't. I have shared this e-book with my friends and family already, and I really suggest it to anyone who is looking to make a profound shift in their health .", "overall": 5.0}

These might seem like they run narrow at first, but this is due to the quality of the leather which will give over time. The fit is a bit shallow over the fore-foot and toe. The lack of volume here may make using an additional full insole uncomfortable, however a 3/4 insole works just fine and doesn't cramp the toes. I wear a US 7.5 or an 8 and the Euro 38 was a perfect fit. I reccomend waterproofing with a wax based product like Sno-seal or a similar product made by Dr. Marten. Also, conditioning from time to time will help keep the leather supple. I had been wanting to try a pair of Kickers for years and am glad I finally did .", "overall": 5.0}
{"reviewText": "This is a great jacket, but 3 stars because I recieved the Mighty Lite II as opposed to the current model, the Mighty Lite III, listed here. Have tried all incarnations of this jacket and the subtle design tweaks in the Mighty Lite III made for an improved fit for me. Previous models were oddly narrow at the top of the sleeve, with uncomfortable seams in the pit area. My arms and shoulders are not big. I'm 5'5, 130, and a small in the Mighty Lite III is a more comfortable fit for wear with light or no layers vs. the previous models. That being said, I had to send the Mighty Lite II back and get the III directly from Columbia. Dissapointing to pay full price for an older model, when you can spend the same on the current updated version... which is what I thought I was getting here. Someone dropped the ball! Great jacket with great features, though. Figure flattering. Great as a mid-layer when it's very cold. Love the thumb-hole cuffs! Worth the trouble to get the right one .", "overall": 3.0}

First thing I noticed is that my skin started clearing up from severe acne,(stress related) my face became brighter more even tone, and the glow is irresistable. Everyone started asking me did I start working out, I said no, with a puzzled look on my face.. Then I realized, it's the AminoSculpt that gave me the muscles without the gym... BONUS!!!!  In closing, it also aides me with falling asleep at bed time instead of all the meds they have me on for pain and sleep.. The only bad thing is, I'm not able to purchase it as often as I should.

{"reviewText": "I recently purchased a head unit for my car, and was excited to get a stereo back into it, as I had not had a car for about 5 years while I was in college, and really missed the years of owning car and having a nice stereo with a sub. It was like my rolling sanctuary, and I wanted that back. I ended up getting a 12\" L5 solobaric sub, based on the praise it got, and the apparent hype surrounding it. The price of the sub fooled me into thinking that it MUST be good. I thought I lucked out getting the sub and a custom ported box for $200.00 on craigslist. The box was huge and built very well. I hooked it up to the cheapo 1200 watt Sound Xtreme amp I had laying around, and was immediatley dissapointed. The bass was just not at all what I was hoping it would be, or would be able to tolerate very long. It was incredibly boomy. It missed many notes in my rock music, as well as a solid portion of my hip hop. For my bassnectar and similar music it rocked. It absolutely pounded. But in the end, it was really only great with that 1 type of music. Playing with the amp and adjusting the gain was pointless, as even on very low settings, it was just wayy too much.  The bass was much too loud for various songs. Some songs sounded fine, some sounded like crud, and some just sounded OFF, wayy to much bass at wrong times, and the sub was unable to fully reproduce all of the different frequencies my music required of it. I did much research over the next few days. Trying to determine how I could get the sound I was after. I read lots of different opinions, wildly different from the next. The worst part was that the people advising all seemed fairly credible, and trustworthy. Yet they all offered different advice, none of which panned out. In the end, I listened to my gut, and decided to purchase a new sub. This time, a round 12\", or possibly a 10\", and also this time, a sealed box. Ported boxes just don't cut it for me. They don't deliver that tight accurate bass that I absolutely crave.I spent about 1.5 weeks scouring the web, reading, comparing prices, listening to advice. I decided in the end that I would suck it up, and buy something that pretty much guaranteed me the results I was after. A JL audio 12\" sub, (12w3 or better) and a sealed box. I was just about to order those 2 things, for the price of about 230.00 after shipping. While I was adding the item to my cart, checking one last time that I had the right sub with the right specs, I accidently clicked a link for the Infinity 1262w. I immeditley realized I had totally forgotten about this company. And I reminisced about my first sub, a 10\" infinity, and how lovely it sounded, and how long it lasted. I saw the price was only $65.00 so immeditley I assumed this was low end gear, and that maybe this was infinity's budget line, on par with the likes of Sony, or Walmart Pioneer subs. Just for giggles,  I decided to check out the reviews, and see what people thought... at 4.5 stars, they must have been pleased. What I found shocked me. The reviews were so overwhelmingly positive, so I set out to find any and all discussion or literature about this sub. Each thing I found was better than the last. Outrageous claims about this sub blowing away top end $200.00 - $400.00 subs. On a handful of occasions, people compared this sub to the JL 10w7,time after time they seemed to favor the 1262w. Instead of being called out as being full of it, they were consistently backed up, and multiple people genuinely agreed. I simply couldn't believe it.I had free 2 day shipping, and 40 bucks in amazon credit, so I said what the heck, and decided to take the chance. I picked up this sub and the reccomended 1.25 cu foot scosche box for $95.00 shipped 2 day air. I hooked this sub up to my same cheapo amp, and wired it to use both voice coils, and I believe it is running @ 2 ohm. IT SLAMS. All music. Any genre. It sounds so amazing, I am absolutely stunned. It gave me exactly what I wanted, and also manged to give me even more than I was hoping for.TL;DR - Just because this sub is $65.00 does not mean it has sacrificed quality for the sake of affordability. Somehow, infinity manages to consistently put out extremely high quality products, and a cost that is not just affordable, but almost discouragingly cheap. I don't get it. I don't know how they do it. I don't understand how there is sooo much crap out there... Countless brands who have become irrelevant over the years for following the same path. The path to Walmart. Sacrificing quality every time in order to be cheap enough to sell mass quantities. Well, let me assure you, Infinity does not have the same problem, and seems to be the only company in the entire Car Audio game that will not succumb to that fate.

{"reviewText": "Reading Lance Larsen's poetry in \"Erasable Walls\" was a refreshing experience especially due to the current literary world being dominated by criticism and novels. Poetry is somewhat of a dying art however Lance Larsen seems to resurrect it through his vivid work. From start to finish, each poem drew me in and allowed me to see the world through a variety of perceptions. In poems like \"Lips\", it's interesting how Larsen focuses on a child's perception of adults and how the details he notices are tied to the superficiality of his mother. With descriptive language like a \"smeared\" mouth and \"wet looking and waxy\" appearance Larsen allows us to step into this child's world and a little bit into our own past. In addition to this, Larsen also illustrates the requirement of children to grow up quickly sometimes, applying adult lenses to the perceptions he creates. In \"Lips\" near the end of the poem he does this, the child describing the numerous duties and errands of his mother and then saying, \"I wanted to save all that, and her.\" In \"February 1922: My Father's Conception\" the perception is reversed, an older man reflecting upon youth. As the older man sees two names chalked into a driveway (presumably done by children) he reflects \"names mapping the erasable walls of the heart.\" It is this kind of in depth imagery that Larsen employs that causes his readers to not only recognize his good writing, but cause them also to reflect upon greater issues and themes throughout life. This play-on-perception is a wonderful tool that Larsen uses that really captivated me and caused me to think about the power of perception and how perception can change reality. The poetry in this book was wonderful and if anyone is truly a fan of poetry, then they shall truly enjoy the work within this book .", "overall": 5.0}

{"reviewText": "no turn based battles, no whiney emo teenagers, and no spiky hair.while most JRPG's are content to simply be set in a fantasy land, yakuza breaks the mold as it is set in modern day japan. Yakuza is a great JRPG that avoids typical JRPG tropes like its the plague, as well as being realistic. set in the red light district of japan (i believe its somewhere in shinjuku or is shinjuku just renamed) called kamurocho, where yakuza reign and the police are corrupt. if you haven't played the first three you should leave this page now and buy them now before you even think about purchasing this game. Yakuza has a lot of content packed in the small town you explore, so much content it may take you several play throughs to experience it all, i have played every yakuza game several time over and i'm STILL finding lots of goodies to enjoy. this is a game that you want to take you time and simply enjoy. the only problem a lot of player will have is the sheer amount of cut scenes, although well done, it can take away from the experience because they tend to drag on for obscene amounts of time. if you thought the amount of cut scenes in MGS4 was ridiculous, this game will put you off. another thing is the fact that each game is set in the exact same place so it can feel a little old after a while, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing. the money and time saved on world building is given to create new areas, like the roof tops and underground areas of yakuza 4, as well as new mini games, side quests and new small details added to the environments themselves. but if you can over look the flaws, you will find a great game that has a very rich and gratifying experience, on par with the likes of skyrim, it may not be as long or as deep as skyrim, but it is certainly the JRPG equivalent to the experience that skyrim provides while being decidedly japanese at the same time .", "overall": 5.0}

{"reviewText": "After having these for a few months, i have bad news to report. The first couple of prints from these cartridges were fine, but after a couple of months of inactivity, these cartridges will now only print blank pages. It has something to do with the ink sensor inside the cartridge. After much research, i have concluded that cheaply refilled dell series 2 ink cartridges are not making proper contact with the Encoder Band inside the printer, which is responsible for squirting the ink out of the cartridge onto the paper. I have also seen news that ALL dell series 2 cartridge ink sensors CANNOT be reset after they are used, therefore in theory, all refilled dell series 2 cartridges will have problems. I also have two black cartridges that i bought from Abacus that i put in just to see, and after a couple of weeks they are both working fine. Maybe theres something Abacus is doing that Enviroinks is not. I cannot guarantee that all cartridges are like this, but all should be weary .", "overall": 1.0}

{"reviewText": "This is a decent cooler for its price but it could be so much better.1. Construction - As most other reviewers have stated, the construction is flimsy at best and heavy mobile use will eventually lead to an accident. Also the metal &#34;incline&#34; bar likes to pop out of slot sometimes wich is bad for the laptop. Also, the unit needs to be propped up on 4 &#34;legs&#34; (i use small square wooden blocks at each corner&#34; to actually get a decent airflow from the bottom.2. Fan - The fan is big, but it doesn't turn fast at all even at max. And it doesnt push that much air to your laptop. After a month of use, i can only get a 2 or 3 degree drop in CPU temperature and a 5 - 10 degree drop on VGA and HDD from this unit.3. Lighting - The red LED is nice and is the main reason i ordered this unit. I thought it would compliment my red backlit keyboard and red lights that i use to operate my computers in the dark. Well i was wrong. The LED is %100 invisible when you have a laptop sitting on the unit, and therefore is of no use at all.4. Size - This unit is advertised to fit 17&#34; inch Laptops. Good luck getting a 15&#34; inch to fit good on it. This unit is for Android Tablets and netbooks when it comes to size.5 - Conclusion - Do not buy! There has to be better products out there for the same price. If your set on a red LED laptop cooler, forget it because very very few Cooler LED's are visible once a laptop is sat on them. Thermaltake kicks ass just not at Laptop Coolers yet .", "overall": 3.0}

Then you can take any 2.5' Hard Drive and slide it in, pop the two sides back on and your ready to go.The only con i can think of, is what makes this design work. The SATA connector is a bit flimsy, and feels like it can be broken off, but it has to be like this so it can move at an angle to connect to the hard drive when you slide it in. If it wasn't flimsy, you would break it before you got a hard drive in it. So as a precaution, be careful when you insert or remove a hard drive .", "overall": 5.0}

{"reviewText": "I was recently diagnosed with breast cancer of the right breast -- second time around for me after being cancer free for 16+ years.  A lot of great changes have taken place since my first surgery (1997), a lumpectomy and lymphnode excision followed by radiation; e.g. sentinel node biopsy (made standard of practice 1 yr. following my surgery); Oncontype DX test.  Through Dr. Love's Breast Book, I learned about the advancements made since 1997, and learned about the pros and cons of aromatase inihibitors.  One big change since my first cancer in 1997, is that chemotherapy is not always the adjuvant treatment of choice depending on the type of cancer.  I learned from Dr. Love's book that because I am estrogen and progesterone receptor positive, and the fact that I am negative for HER-2/neu, my cancer would not benefit from chemotherapy.  This was confirmed by my doctors.  For these reasons and others, I have opted for a bilateral mastectomy with immediate reconstruction.  I have been informed that I will be admitted for only 23 hrs. following surgery, not the &#34;few days&#34; admission stated in the book.  That is the only thing in my experience I have found different from that presented in the book.  I found the book very beneficial in that it made me a more informed patient and therefore able to communicate better with my medical team .", "overall": 4.0}

Now, just need to direct him verbally to use the stairs by saying, &#34;Stairs, Buddy&#34; and he climbs up them without the use of treats.

{"reviewText": "T.E. Lawrence was a very reserved person, who was virtually forced to take the lead in the Arab revolt, to try and get some sort of sense, from the situation he found himself in.He was able to take advantage of his wide experience, for a young man, in the regional history and culture of the Arabs, to gain entry into their midst, without seeming too English. He had spent several years in Palestine and surrounds, studying the many Crusade Fortresses and general culture.He was also able to get a high level of Authority in the British side of things, through these same first hand and in depth experiences and because he was in the British Army already.Once he was able to get in contact with the Arab side, in the form of Prince Faisal, he had an amazing influence on the whole revolt, instead of only having a passive influence, as an adviser he took the lead and became in fact a very successful General soldier, leading his part of the war effort, by using Gorilla tactics, he was able to discomfort the Turks and force their retreatFinally he was able to take Damascus and if he had been able to unite the various Arab factions, he would have really changed history in the region, to the point that today would still have seen the effects he would have caused, but unfortunately that didn't happen and we are where we are now, because of British interference in Palestine, after the Arab revolt.Lawrence has given us an amazing piece of Literary work, that stands out in our 21st century as a beacon of what mankind can do, if he is working from a clean heart, not just for lucre.Lawrence also was a victim of his own success and fame followed him everywhere he went and with a certainty that he was suffering from Post Traumatic Stress, he had a bad time of itI believe that he could have very easily taken High Public Office after the war finished, had he been recognised properly for his work, but instead he gave us Seven Pillars of Wisdom .", "overall": 5.0}

{"reviewText": "This is a great system, I really like it. Here's my review about it.Note: I didn't purchase this on Amazon but this is the exact system that I bought so I decided to write a review about it here.This system comes with the DVR, four cameras, four 60ft power+video siamese cables, a mouse, the power supply (power brick) for DVR, and a single power supply with a 4-way splitter for all of the cameras.- - - - - - - - - - - - -Part 1: The DVRThe DVR is great. It's nice and clean looking. The user interface looks crappy but I didn't pay much for it so I don't expect a pretty UI on it. It's also not that intuitive/user-friendly but I'm pretty familiar with it now . It was much easier than I thought it would be to install the hard drive. The screws on the DVR cover weren't even on it yet (they were in a bag with the hard drive screws) which made it easier to install the hard drive since I didn't have to unscrew each screw on the hard drive first. It came with the screws for the hard drive as well as the hard drive cover. I got a 500GB \"white label\" hard drive for $45 on another site and it's working great.The DVR has motion detection recording which is really nice. You can set it to continuously record or to only record when it detects motion. You can also set it up to send you an email when it detects motion and attach a picture of the motion it detected.- - - - - - - -EDIT: I have now successfully set up the networking stuff. It didn't take me too long, and I followed Zmodo's tutorial but I have experience with networking so it was pretty easy. You just have to open a few ports on your router. I can view my cameras anywhere on my iPhone as well as from any computer (that has Internet Explorer - ugh, I know... but it requires ActiveX to work). I couldn't get the email notification to work though - it just wouldn't work. I would've constantly been getting emails anyway though since the motion detection recording is triggered all the time.- - - - - - - -The DVR has 8 BNC video inputs, 2 BNC outputs, 4 RCA audio inputs, 2 USB inputs (one for mouse and one for flash drive to back up files), 1 ethernet input, 1 VGA output (for monitor), and the power input.- - - - - - - - - - - - -Part 2: The CamerasThis system comes with 4 cameras but the DVR is 8 channel so I have the ability to extend it if I need to add more cameras. The cameras were a little bigger than I expected them to be, but they're not too big. A couple years ago I got a couple of Lorex cameras from Radio Shack, and they're a bit smaller than these Zmodo cameras; I was expecting the Zmodo cameras to be as small as the Lorex ones. They do have more IR lights (night vision) on them though. The Lorex cameras that I previously had have microphones built in to them but the Zmodo cameras do NOT have microphones. I'm using the Lorex camera for the front door (so I have audio) but you can buy this small microphone to attach to one or more of the Zmodo security cameras for audio:VideoSecu High Sensitive Audio Pickup Device External Amplified Tiny Spy Microphone for CCTV Security Camera with Bonus Warning Decal WD6You'll have to purchase a cord that has the audio though too (they're available here on Amazon - 100ft video+audio+power cable for around $10).The cameras come with brackets and the mounting screws. It's kind of difficult to get it just right but I haven't had issues with the mounting brackets like others have had - they didn't break and I tightened it pretty good. Also, the camera colors are pretty accurate. I noticed some people have said that the camera colors aren't accurate but mine are pretty accurate.The night vision isn't that great, but it's better than just a black screen. You can see more than shadows but still not enough to identify someone. Lights that are outside your house make the night vision better though.- - - - - - - - - - - - -Overall, I am very happy with this system. I got a nice 8 channel DVR with 4 cameras for a great deal.PLEASE NOTE: This system does not come with a hard drive installed in the DVR, you have to buy it separately. You can still view the cameras without the hard drive but you won't be able to record anything without it .", "overall": 4.0}

{"reviewText": "Once upon a time, I bought a pair of this grey earbuds to use them when I'm outside and at school. When i first used them, I was shocked by the sound it delivered, even when I was outdoor. They have an EXCELLENT isolation from the noise outside. You put them on, press play and you can be in the middle of the traffic.... you WILL HEAR NO CAR. I also use them as ear protection when i'm in the workshop at school cutting wood with VERY loud machines. It protects your ears and also, the sound quality remains excellent.I've compared them with the Beats by Dre buds from a friend. Although the Beats cover very well the whole range of sound, the Skullcandy offer a more intense, powerful bass. It's like comparing the Monster's Studio and the Solo HD Dre headphones.They deserve the place in my heart for the best earbuds ever. However, I know that many people complain about the build quality. They lasted me 8 months... It's still a pretty decent run. They would have probably lasted more, but I borrowed them to some of my friends and they must have damaged the straight cable. One week after they returned them, my Left earbud was dead. My beloved Ink'd were unusable...To honor the best earphones that I had, I cut the Right one and put it on my key-chain. I really loved them.LESSON LEARNED: Never EVER EVER EVER borrow your headphones to anybody. Thrust NO ONE! hahahaLike all the stories that start with \"Once upon a time...\", this one has a happy ending too. I went to the store I first bought them and found them! It was the last pair, and I had to search for them a little bit, but there were finally mine again! This time is a black pair, that can't wait for the school to start. In my opinion, there are the best pair you can buy for the 20 (the price I here in Italy).Final judgement: THIS EARBUDS ROCKS!!!Cheers .", "overall": 5.0}
{"reviewText": "I have the Acer Aspire 7741G model with Core i5 (2.66 GHz), 6 Gb of RAM, 640 GB HDD and AMD Radeon HD 6550M. (It's the brother of this model)I bought this computer about 2 years ago. I'VE DID EVERYTHING WITH IT. I've even installed Mac OS X on it and IT WORKED.I am an architecture student and a freelance designer, so i need to run HEAVY software. AutoCAD, Photoshop, Illustrator, video editing, etc... it handles them like a charm! For multitasking, it's a great computer.For gaming... well, let's just say IT CAN handle new games (gta 4, assassins creed 1 to 3, COD MW 3 etc.) with no problems and graphics settings quite high, BUT it OVERHEATS... After some point, it \"black outs\" (shuts down and can't turn on for about 10 mins) for the heat. I've heard some people use cooling pads, but I haven't tried them yet.One thing i hate is the battery life... It's horrible! I can't even watch a full movie without recharging (in energy saving mode), but for me it's not a great problem. I almost always use it on a desk, so i really don't care that much.Anyway, in the long run, it's a pretty reliable machine. Only problem I had was with the HDD which was damaged (after i installed Mac OS and Win 7, and Mac OS and Win 7 for about 20 times). Most likely because of the repeated formats of the drive.THIS REMINDS ME I HAVE TO ADVICE EVERYONE ABOUT ONE THING: ALWAYS STORE YOUR IMPORTANT DATA ON AN EXTERNAL HARD DRIVE.I've learned my lesson when my first laptop crashed and i lost everything... Now for the grand finale.Pros & Cons for this bad boy:PRO: very fast processor, good screen, full keyboard, reliable*, lots of memory, very decent graphics (for a laptop), will still give you at least a couple more years of good use.CON: LAME BATTERY LIFE, keyboard build**, needs more USB ports, build quality (made of cheap plastic... i'm always afraid to break it when i have to take it outside), design**** if you don't abuse it like i did** although i love a full keyboard, the type on this model it's awful. The perfect keyboard type is on the mac book pro's or the sony vaio's.*** i prefer other designs, but this is not the worse i've seen. Also, i don't like the back lid texture because my stickers don't stick very well. lol .", "overall": 5.0}

{"reviewText": "Overall I'm pretty happy with this coat. Past reviewers commented that the wool was scratchy, or low quality. Yes, it's scratchy, but not terrible. To be honest, when compared to other wool items that I have, it is pretty smooth. It has a smooth felted feel to it, which is perhaps why past reviewers didn't like it? (It isn't fuzzy soft, or lambswool - it's more like a &#34;motor coat&#34; kind of wool.) The quality is about what I expected for the price. The wool isn't super thick, which I appreciate, so the &#34;skirt&#34; of the coat drapes fairly well. It's warm, windproof, probably not the coat I'd want for sub-zero temperatures, but great for cool brisk November days in Oregon. I liked the studded sleeves better than I expected, they stand out more on the actual coat than they do in the photo, and they add a nice feminine touch. I love the gray color.  Now for the less than ideal... it's not quite as structured as I thought it would be, and it bunches up a little around the waist. The arms could be a little longer but I always have trouble getting coats with long enough arms. I'm 5'8 and ordered the small, but wonder if I should have gotten the extra small - the shoulders fit, but as I mentioned there is a little bunching of some extra fabric around the waist. That seems to always be the trade-off- enough room in the shoulders, or a nice tailored look around the middle. When all is said and done, this coat is a little bulkier than it looks in the photo, but I still like it. I'm keeping it, and in the few times I've worn it, I've gotten a lot of compliments .", "overall": 4.0}

It's not that it's not good, it's good, but there's much better books out there to spend your time on. The book just doesn't flow well in my opinion, it has ups, it has downs, and it has bumpy patches that could have been smoothed out. Some parts feel like they could be fleshed out more, and others like they last a little too long with not much to keep the reader interested. If you loved the first book, read this one, if you had reservations after finishing the first, find something else.

{"reviewText": "I find it hard to believe that \"Lesson in Romance\" is Harmony Evan's debut novel. It has exciting plot twists, passionate love scenes, funny moments, and tender heart-breaking relationship advances. I like how the author shows you what is happening from both Cara's and Alex's perspectives and ignites you with the fire from their chemistry together. To me, one of the features that distinguishes this book from other authors is the description of the setting and the atmosphere. I really feel the author truly comprehends the magical (and sometimes blatantly financial) world of music and music composition, as well as the pressing issue of illiteracy, which somehow continues to exist in our first-world country today. This is more than a thrilling romance novel - Harmony Evans gives us a peek into the bright world of music while also showing us a glimpse of how pressing dark issues like illiteracy and gangs persist today. But - man - Alex can 'play my instrument' anytime. Phew!!  I can't wait to read Harmony Evan's next book .", "overall": 5.0}

I've no complaints about this product except for the securing system. The clips attach to the webbing perfectly, however, the straps that are supposed to secure it in place are constantly slipping which allows the carrier to sag below the comfort zone(wherever you prefer that it stays). I'm not military,  just a facilities maintenance person, but it seems that if I was carrying this all day and having to adjust it regularly in a combat zone or even in a security area,  I'd be a lot more annoyed than I am now being in an urban environment,  running from property to property, fixing, carrying, moving things. I plan on getting a heavy elastic strap and lacing it through the ends of the securing straps to see if that helps.06/20/13  The camo neoprene(or whatever it's made of) began pulling away from the top of the drink tube.

I think all trades people should have something like this).within a week, stitching began loosening in the molle loops. All I've used it for is a caribiener with keys(35 keys, to be fair).

The view finder is a little off but I'm so glad to have it as an option to the screen. It was really hard finding a camera in this price range with a real view finder.

{"reviewText": "This book was interesting on so many levels.  It was a great looking glass into the history of a time that I did not know much about.  (History major, here).  It dispelled many myths I had about that particular century, (i.e. no one ever bathed), and it made me curious enough to explore the Hapsburg family to see how close fact was to fiction.Great read.

{"reviewText": "I needed a bike mount for my phone for when I go to unfamiliar places. I saw this and it looked like what I was looking for. It wasn't too expensive either. It was shipped quickly and installation was easy. It easily held my GS4 in all types of cases. I used it for directions so that I don't need to hold my phone or have earphones in to see directions. The only problem is that the phone shook a lot no matter how tight I had the mount. This shaking caused the phone's position to shift constantly. I used it quite frequently. About 4-5 times per week for 1 hour each time. I was riding around, and I hear a slight crack as I'm riding on a slightly bumpy sidewalk. Then I hit a minor bump (barely 1 inch) and the phone-holding part completely separated from the mount. I did have a very protective case on my phone, but if I didn't, my phone would have been destroyed. Honestly I only recommend this product if you are only staying on paved streets .", "overall": 3.0}

I ordered a large but really a medium would have suited me better. I'll keep it as sending back to China would be more of a hassle. I do have to say, I was VERY impressed to have received this dress one week after I ordered it! I wasn't expecting it til mid May.  I'm very pleased with this dress and feel super pretty in it. I'd definitely recommend a good push up bra and spanx to go underneath and really bring out the desired effect. This would make a great first date dress, just broke up with my boyfriend dress, or girls night out dress. It's light weight so if you're on the dance floor, you won't sweat too bad and if a drink is spilled on you, it will absorb quickly...win, win.

Around 100 pages were in shrink condition that I have to put them back into their right place. I wonder where those pages started to shrink; is it from the packaging point or at the checking or customs point?.While reading the words and their definitions I found that they are very clear and understandable. Everything almost as perfect as I've been expected to. However, there are things that caused me to conclude that it is only a four starred dictionary. The first is the paper which is too thin, which is easily torn apart. Secondly, there is no colorful picture to attract my eyes. Thirdly, I need more encyclopedic definitions about some worldly events like the 9/11 2001 in New York. In my opinion there should be a picture of the \"late\" twin towers along with the list of suspects, both individual and organization, and more detailed story about what exactly has happened in the 9/11 event. But most of all, it is a quite satisfying dictionary which must be collected by everyone who is serious in English .", "overall": 4.0}

The content is so extraordinary, which means exceeded my expectation, the paper and cover are of high quality materials. The only question I keep asking is that the dictionary seemed specially composed for the exclusive use of American people only because the entries and pictures are too Americanized. But most of all I would not change my 5 stars rating for this product since it has brought me a newer nuance in words exploration .", "overall": 5.0}

The first is the abundance of word entries which is not found in any other dictionaries. Secondly, the amazing printed size book, which caused other people to think that I might be a great lexicographer while carrying the book.

Beyond the photos, Friedman provides a brief guide to understanding the history of the companies that were behind the blankets, thus providing context for the wonderful photos.

I turned it off and on, tare it every time and still get different readings. I tried my friends Eat Smart Pro and it read 500 grams every single time I tried the weight. I thought it was a fluke and tried some other weights of things I already knew and it was always off.I may contact Ozeri to see if its just this unit, but I really don't want something this inaccurate if its not.

The outer construction is fine and the foam is fine too.The color is also black, not a light grey as shown in the pictures.Also another poster mentioned something about the massage not functioning even with batteries in.

{"reviewText": "After almost a month of owning it, I'm thinking seriously to return it.I bought it mostly 'cause I needed an USB microSD reader for my son's R4, so I thought it would be nice to charge my smartphone as an added bonus to the reader. That part works quite good, I'm using it to charge my Bluetooth headphones to with no problems at all.The problem comes from the reader itself. When you put on the microSD card inside it, it stays on its \"Slot\" but when you place the reader into the USB port on the computer, the port seems to push the microSD card further inside the reader and then one of 2 things can happen: Either the PC doesn't know that the reader has a card inside it (You see the reader but not volume in File Explorer) or it DAMAGES THE microSD CARD!. Maybe the reader that I got is broken somehow but after inspecting it, I think it's a design flaw. It doesn't seem to have any way to stop the SD card from going further inside it AND it is a real pain to remove the card from the reader, I had to use a needle like for 2 minutes to take it out. It damaged my daughter's 16GB microSD card from her phone and an old 2GB microSD that I had lying around, which was not big deal (My daughter WAS!). It was literally burnt, I almost burn my fingers taking it out from the reader due to heat.I live in Venezuela and it certainly took a long time to come here, I bought it with some other things and I haven't read the return policies yet. I'll edit this when I found out more about this.So, in conclusion:1.- Fine charger, works as advertised2.- Very bad USB reader, but had to be used carefully.PD: I failed to mention that it worked fine on my sister's laptop but all the bad things happened on my PC. But the SD removal issue, happened regardless on where I used it .", "overall": 2.0}

{"reviewText": "Fellow law students (also medical, engineering....anyone who spends their days reading out of giant books), this is the book stand for you.I'm not much of a reviewer usually, but this has totally changed my life so I couldn't help myself.Pros:No more stiff neck...worth the purchase on this point alone.Makes typing while reading, which used to be a time suck of shifting books and looking around, as simple as could be.Now this is true of any book stand, so why this one?- 1st of all, sturdy as can be AND tiny. No trade off here. Can hold even my biggest textbook (I'm looking at you, Cherminsky).-The clamps are really sturdy, but easy enough to move out of the way for turning pages, so no additional time wasted there.-Like I said...it's small. Smaller than I expected, so I was a little nervous, but it does all it claims to do and takes up less space doing it.-The adjustable back is great. Never realized how useful it would be to be able to change the slant depending where I was using it. Even found the appropriate angle for reading in bed, which was an unexpected benefit.Cons:You may have noticed that I only awarded four stars even though I can't stop rambling about how great this product is. As much as I love it, there are just a couple more things I would look for in my ideal book stand:- First, portability. Yes, this is small, but something foldable would be better for taking along to the library with me. Most of the foldable stands out there can't hold paperbacks and aren't adjustable, but a stand just like this that you could fold up and toss in your bag would be great. Wishful thinking? Sure. But the heart wants what it wants.-Second, with a bigger book (still got my eye right on you, Cherminsky), it's hard enough to use this when you're too close to one end of the book that I just don't use it at all. Basically, with most of the pages on one side the clamp can't hold it in place. Yes I'm talking about 1,000 pages, but since the clamp slides to hold almost any size anyway, I don't think there's any reason it couldn't be a little larger.TL;DR: I love this book stand... if you need one, buy this one. Totally adjustable, small, sturdy and useful. Love you, Actto .", "overall": 4.0}

Consulting has included providing assistance and support to those seeking to release fears, to realize understanding of inner experiences, and to expand conscious awareness. \"The Sun Has No Shadow\" by Etienne Pait is an asset of value for those seekers.When honoring the longing and yearning of heart to know one's real identity, old \"mind stuff\" emerges into view disrupting daily life. Etienne's shared life experiences and professional qualifications combine to provide a rare and significant supportive piece of material beneficial during a transformational process.It is rare today to find current written material by an author genuinely open to sharing sensitive and delicate experiences from his own life, experiences rarely shared except, perhaps, with a very trustworthy confidant. For those fearful of sensitive inner experiences little understood, there is now an author living in our time actually writing from his own life experience and has lived the ways and means to accomplish expanded conscious awareness.What a blessing Etienne's writing is, because he has carefully laid out case studies and examples along with comprehensive and practical steps the reader may successful apply to daily life to accomplish relief from fear - fear of the unknowns and reactive emotions often emerging during life transitions.When opening and beginning to read \"The Sun Has No Shadow\", a reader soon realizes they are not alone, for Etienne's sharing reveals him as a sincere fellow traveler in facing the challenges life presents. A page in the beginning of the book says it all regarding the quality of Etienne's character. It is titled 'In Gratitude'. Once one has read this paragraph, one knows they have found a loving friend.As a consultant assisting individuals facing life transitions, I thank you, Etienne Pait, for providing a written work earnest, sincere and comprehensive regarding a very delicate and sensitive subject. What a delight to now have available this supportive piece so precious to those longing in their hearts to know their real identity .", "overall": 5.0}

You get in fact, two screen protectors, one is a backup.HOW TO INSTALL:1. Find a clean work environment, clean the your phone, remove dust, etc.2. Take the screen protector out of it's carrier bag, and place it where you want it to go onto the phone (goes on one way with how it is cut out). It is indicated which side faces up.3. Take the piece of tape in your kit and tape it to the screen protector and to the side and back of your phone.4. The screen protector can now open up like a book. Open it up, and peel off the reverse of the screen protector exposing the sticky part. If any dust has gotten onto your screen, remove it. Place the screen protector back by closing the 'book like' flap closed.5. Remove the final protective cover with the last tab that sticks out, the tape that was attached to your phone will also come off. If you want to, maybe remove some bubbles now with the squeegee.6. Remove final bubbles, and make sure everything is pressed down firmly. You are done.NOTES: The 'dust removal tape' is sticky as all hell... I did not use it because it adhered way way way too strongly. I don't advise using it, maybe get some scotch tape if you really want .", "overall": 5.0}

{"reviewText": "This game is quite innovative in that it combines multiple genres including a variation of the point and click detective adventure, grand theft auto, and the Phoenix Wright-like choice dialogue system. The main issue I had with this game is that despite the great job with facial features, tone, and what not, that give you clues as to what you need to say. Throughout the game you are supposed to use these human features to determine if they are telling the truth, lying, or if you should doubt them about a piece of testimony. It can really be random, kind of like in Phoenix Wright games where the dialogue does not make clear at times to what you need to do, especially since human aspects that indicate you should pick lie, or pick doubt, are quite similar. Luckily, if you are a perfectionist, there are plenty of guides. However, this is the type of game you really can't enjoy the first time unless you don't use one. Another thing, and this is for the xbox 360 version of the game, before you buy, you should know that the game is 3 discs due to hd dvd's terrible storage capacity .", "overall": 4.0}

{"reviewText": "Ok so I&#699;m not sure what others are expecting out of a $25 fog machine...BUT, for what it IS. It&#699;s a good product.  First off...NO, it&#699;s not going to fill half a gym with fog.  And NO, it&#699;s not going to have a timer. C&#699;mon..it&#699;s UNDER 30 BUCKS!!!  It&#699;s a good machine for what it is.  If you take good care of it, it should last.  To give you an idea of how much fog it puts out.  I put a good amont of fog in my 2-car garage on just ONE blast.  After 2 or 3, the whole garage was filled.  Here&#699;s my take:PRO&#699;s:  Small, lightweight, inexpensive, decent quality built of good materials. 3-5 minute warm-up time, and same amount of time between fog blasts.  Fog blast lasts about a minute or so.CON&#699;s: Small tank.For those of you who broke it after the 1st or 2nd use.  A couple of fog machine basics:#1 CLEAN IT AFTER EVERY USE!  Dump out whatever leftover fog juice you have, put some distilled water in there, and shoot it for a few minutes.  Then dump the water and store the machine.#2 DON&#699;T RUN THE THING DRY!I&#699;m thinking about buying another one and running one on each side of my DJ rig.UPDATE:I changed my rating to FIVE ***** Stars.  Why?  Because I&#699;ve used it a few times, and it is MORE than decent for what it is. It&#699;s REALLY GOOD for what it is!  I spent less than $30 bucks on this little machine and while it&#699;s not pumping out sheets, or cloud billows of fog...it puts out more than what I expected from this machine!  I did a small (50-80 pax) DJ gig in a basketball gym, and NO...this machine DID NOT fill the place or even a quarter of the place. But what it DID do, was put enough fog in front of my lights to make it a little more dynamic up front. And that&#699;s all I expected it to do.  Did it meet my expectation?  YEP. And it exceeded it because I only filled it about 1/2 way, and that thing ran the entire gig (3-4 hours). The warm up time is around 5-7 minutes, and then it takes about the same amount of time, maybe just a little less: 3-5 minutes in between blasts, but it&#699;s good.  I think the key here is CLEANING THE MACHINE AFTER EVERY USE.  That&#699;s where people run into problems.  You cannot leave fog juice in this thing for an extended period of time. So I just run distilled water thru it after every single use.And I decided NOT to buy a second machine. Instead, when I upgrade my lightng and buy a truss system, I&#699;ll spend the money and get a bigger machine.  Until then, this little puppy does a fine job .", "overall": 5.0}

{"reviewText": "There are tons of positive reviews (and negative ones too!) on this blade and this is going to be yet another.  For a really good review on this blade, check out Nutnfancy's review on YouTube.  Just search using Kershaw OSO Sweet. Nutn's will be one of the first ones that comes up.  He's got all the main info on this knife in the description, and gives it a 9/10 rating.  Anyway, take it for what it's worth.Here's my take:The knife was $16 bucks (actually only $11 DOLLARS, + $4.99 shipping via USPS) SHIPPED... TO HAWAII.  It doesn't get much better than that!  I like the blade shape, and it's a good length for EDC. Almost exactly the same length as my Spyderco Tenacious, but a shorter handle.  And LIGHT. I like that A LOT.  I carry a Streamlight ProTac flashlight with my blade in my right front pants pocket, so this Oso Sweet is gonna be great because it won't weigh my pocket down very much.The blade:Steel is 8Cr13MoV.  Decent enough quality for me. (ESPECIALLY in a $16 dollar knife!)Blade length is perfect, again for EDC.SHARP as hell, right out of the box.Hard to deploy right out of the box.  I'm going to oil it a little bit, and try to work it in...but it's a little stiff to open.NO blade play at all, up/down/left/right. Very good there.I wish the liner lock stuck out just a little bit more so it would be easier to unlock. Not a big deal, but that would be nice.Blade is fairly close to centered when closed.  It's not perfectly centered, but almost.  No big deal...(remember...$16 bucks!!!)Handle:Plastic, lightweight...not sure how durable at this point, but again...$16 bucks?!!!I like the \"spiderweb\" texture, it's interesting to me.Wish it had some jimping along the top, but it's not a dealbreaker.Clip:As others have mentioned...it is REALLY strong.  Almost TOO much.  I think the clip is a little short as well.  I like the look of it though, with Kershaw along the side.  Nice looking but a little too much tension.  I can see it ripping up some types of pants fabrics if I'm not careful.Overall:Great EDC blade for this price. It may not be a Benchmark, but for what it IS...it's probably the best quality in a $16 dollar knife I've ever had. I wasn't actually looking for a new blade, but had this one saved in my wishlist.  So when I saw this knife on sale on Amazon...I HAD to get it at this price. And I'm SO GLAD I did!  I would recommend this knife, even if it was $25 bucks.  That's still a good price on this blade. If it's still on sale for $11 plus $4.99 shipping...BUY IT.  Right now I wish I bought TWO.And please...those of you who are comparing this knife to other more expensive, higher quality steel, G-10 Scales, made in the USA, blah-blah-blah, etc etc etc, knives... There is NO COMPARISON. If you want THAT knife...go buy that one. But...pull out any and EVERY other $10-$15 dollar knife, and compare that one to this $16 dollar Kershaw OSO Sweet, and let's see how THAT comparison looks.  This blade will beat out almost EVERYTHING in it's price range.Nuff Said .", "overall": 5.0}
{"reviewText": "When I was deciding to buy this I really couldn&#699;t tell from the pic what it looked like...because HELLO??!!!  The pic is showing the INSIDE (belt loop side) of the pouch!!!  Why they did that I have no idea!!  BUT... once I got it...it was EXACTLY what I wanted.  It&#699;s a dual mag plastic pouch, and it holds my mags (Glock 17) in place very well. It has a nice fit where the mags slide in firmly. I loaded 2 full double stack mags and turned it upside down and shook it...and yes, after a couple of shakes the mags did fall out...however, how many of you are planning to do a handstand and jiggle your magazines out??! It works folks.  And the price is decent and it&#699;s fairly &#34;low profile&#34;  and isn&#699;t a big bulky holder.  I believe the screw that you see between the two magazines is a tension screw and will put more tension on the mags.  I haven&#699;t tried it yet, but I don&#699;t see the need at the moment.  I&#699;m happy with how it holds my magazines.OH...AND you can set both magazines facing the same direction for easy/quick reloads.  I know there is another mag pouch out there where you can only put them in facing the opposite direction.  I don&#699;t like that.  I&#699;d rather them be set up so I can pull and load in one quick motion...without having to worry about turning one.For the price I paid, and what I got...it&#699;s 5 *&#699;s for me .", "overall": 5.0}
{"reviewText": "Right off the bat...This one gets 5 FIVE STARS.  I'd give it 10 of 10 if I could.Ok now on on to my review of this knife:While this is the first \"name brand\" folding knife I've ever bought, I've carried an EDC folding blade on me for years. I own a Cold Steel SRK fixed blade, and I love that knife. It's my hunting/camping/survival knife. And I own a Schrade SCHF10, which I also love.  But when it comes to folders...I've always bought the no-name, use it/break it, or lose it, then throw it away knives.  Usually whatever looks good at my local hardware store, or gun shop.  With that being said, I currently own maybe 8-10 different no-name folders (all under $20 bucks) that I have rotated in and out of my EDC gear and I have maybe 2 that I like, and that actually work in my system. The one I've been carrying the most over the last 2 years has been a Tac-Force Karambit style blade ($15 bucks).  I've dropped that thing in the mud, used it in a river, dropped it from a ladder about 20' off the ground, abused it in the rain, and it's been good, but it's seen it's better days, and it's not much in terms of a slicer.So in my search for a replacement, I started to think about getting something with a little better quality. If I add up all those $10-15-18-20 dollar knives...I could have 3 or 4 really GOOD blades! I probably won't buy a Benchmark or any other knife over a hundred bucks...I just don't have the need or budget for one like that.  BUT... this Spyderco fit my budget (UNDER $50 bucks), useage, and my EDC needs perfectly so I bought it...  And I'm glad I did! On this purchase, I researched all kinds of knives and steel types before making my choice.  And for the money...the Spyderco Tenacious is hard to beat.  Yes, there are tons of good quality knives at this same price range, but then I believe it just comes down to personal preference. I narrowed my search down to Spyderco and the SOG Flash 2 (they're both about the same price), but chose the Tenacious because I've always been drawn to that cool blade shape with the hole in it!  (I WILL buy that SOG soon!)I live in Hawaii so we are exposed to salt air and water on a regular basis.  I don't plan on diving with my knife, but I needed a blade with steel and internals that was going to have some corrosion resistance. I wanted something I could use as a back up on a hunt, camping, or to cut boxes at work.  I also needed this to be a regular EDC blade, and I wanted to stay away from the tactical look, and get more of a gentleman's carry that's still agressive enough looking.  What I wanted was something high speed, lightweight, strong, durable, and of course...some good looks never hurt nobody! I found it in the Spyderco Tenacious!-The G10 scales are grippy enough..but not overly so.  Just right, in my opinion.-I like the blade.  It is a little thin towards the tip, but it's nothing I'll worry about. I personally prefer the plain edge vs. the combo edge.  I also prefer the FFG (full flat grind) blade.  It's just my own preference. I think the 8Cr13MoV steel is a high enough quality...again, at least for my personal requirements.-NO blade play when the knife is open.  None at ALL. Up/down, side to side...nothing.  I've seen reviews of people saying there was some in their knives, but none in mine. When closed, the blade sits dead centered. I've also seen reviews with people saying their blades were off-centered, mine was not one of those.-Ergo: Feels good in my hand. Nice jimping at the top.  Nice big hole to slide my thumb in to open.  Opens quickly enough.  Not as fast as my Tac Force assisted opening Karambit, or my buddy's SOG Aegis 2 assisted opener...but good nonetheless, with a solid \"Thwackk\" upon lock-up.  I LIKE that!-Clip is a bit tight, but not a deal breaker.  I like that I can change it to a tip up carry as opposed to tip down, as it comes from the factory.-The liner lock looks very strong.  Nice tight lock up when deployed.  I like that not only can I open the blade with one hand, but I can also press the liner lock, and close the blade with one hand as well.-The BEST thing I like about this knife is the Foilage Green handles!  I wish the blade was black with the green handles...but again, not a deal breaker at all. The green is sweet! Pic's online don't do it any justice.  It's not a bright green at all. But not a dark OD Green either.  As I said, I wanted something that wasn't SO TACTICAL. My Streamlight ProTAC flashlight is black tactical, same as my Tac Force karambit, AND my SOG multi-tool!  I just wanted to tone down the Tactical Operator look of my EDC.  The foilage green makes this knife less imposing, in my opinion.-And finally...it was super sharp right out of the box! I ran it on a ceramic sharpener when I got it just to take off some of the burrs...but VERY sharp.Overall I love this knife!  So much so, that I'm already looking at the Spyderco Manix 2.  THAT knife is on the higher end of my budget, I'm trying to stay under the $50 mark for my EDC blades, but I might make the exception for the Manix 2 (AFTER I buy the SOG Flash 2!!) Here's something I don't get: I've seen tons of reviews here (just click on all the 1 or 2 star reviews) that talk about how bad this knife is or how it pales in comparison to other brands, or even other Spyderco knives.  Here's my thing: Hell, if you were expecting to get the same quality as an Endura or Paramilitary...why didn't you just buy THAT??!  This is a $36 dollar BUDGET Spyderco.  Review it for what it is.  A blade made in China, that is in their budget line of knives. And to that end...it's a GREAT blade for the price. But back to my Spyderco Tenacious in foilage green.  Great price, great knife!Buy it, Use it, LOVE it. You won't be disappointed.  *And if you ARE...go buy a Benchmark and be happy .", "overall": 5.0}

{"reviewText": "If any of you watch YouTube...look up Nutnfancy's review of this light. He says it all...Originally, I was looking at either the Preon-1 or 2, or the Pro Stylus, and ended up seeing this one on the page for the Stylus here on Amazon... so I clicked on it and opened it up.  And I am glad I did!  I was looking for an EDC flashlight that was light enough to carry in my pocket every day, but wasn't going to break the bank in terms of cost, and this fits that role perfectly.  I didn't want to spend more than $30 on this light because I already have an Olight M20 Warrior, and an Olight T25 which I LOVE both...but even the T25 is a little too big for EDC (at least for me).  The Preon 1 is a twist top (to turn on/off) and I wanted a tailcap pushbutton, and that's why the Pro Stylus was my original choice. (I STILL may buy the Preon-1, because for only $32 bucks that thing looks like a powerhouse of a mini flashlight!) However, I ended up going with this one instead of the Pro Stylus due to the higher lumens and it has a high/low/strobe function, which the Pro Stylus does not.  And in comparison to the Preon-1, this was a little bigger, and I didn't want to lose the small Preon.And wow...this thing is awesome for such a little pkg.Pro's (for me):Good amount of light: 80 lumens on high, 10 on low.Lightweight.  I barely notice it's there.O-rings for water resistance. (I think it says it's waterproof down to 3-5 meters or something like that, but I don't intend on diving with it, so that's fine.)Good quality build.Good price: $29 bucks on Amazon, but I've seen it for less elsewhere.I like that it uses AAA batteries, which are readily available anywhere. (There is a AA version of this light as well, if you want a little bigger version!)Con's:I wish the clip was a little higher, so it rides deeper in my pocket.  So I don't lose it.The tailcap button is hard to press.  But I'm finding I might like that so it doesn't accidently get turned on in my pocket or bag.I wish it came in other colors: metallic orange, blue, green, etc.  Then it's easer to find in a dark bag at night.I wish the high/low beams were right next to each other, instead of it being: Hight (single click), Strobe (double click), and Low (triple click).  Put the low before strobe!  I'm sure there is some reason for that.  But it's not a deal breaker by any means.It fits in my pocket right next to my Spydeco Tenacious just fine.  It's about the size of a fat sharpie pen and I barely notice it's there.  In fact since I started carrying it, I have to reach down once in a while to feel if it's still there!So here's what I did at home when I first got it.  I pulled out my large Maglite, my Olight T25, and a no name Asian brand LED light I bought here on Amazon for 4 bucks (I didn't bother bringing out the M20 because that thing is a beast. I turned all the lights out in my living room and tested them by shining them on the ceiling one at a time.  The Maglite and T25 have fairly new batteries, and the little LED has never been used.  So the T25 was brightest, the no-name LED was dead last...and this little Streamlight beat that huge Maglite! In terms of brightness, wide beam...it killed my big maglite! I took my new ProTAC outside and shined it out to where my dogs are (about 20m) and it lit up the whole area.  I don't think it throws 80m as advertised...but it sure does put out a lot of light.If you're looking for a good quality, high lumen EDC light that won't break the bank...this IS IT. Buy it. Carry it.  Love it.  You'll be glad you did.UPDATE:Last night after a gig (I moonlight as a musician) I was walking out along the back of the hotel I was at, back to the parking lot and remembered I had my ProTAC in my pocket, so I pulled it out to test it. It was really dark, almost pitch black, and I must say, this light really lit up the entire area.  So I'll take back what I said above...this light lit up a couple trash cans and boxes that were out at least 60m from where I was!  I shined it down this really long maintenance pathway, and it lit the whole area.  I am impressed more than I was before. If you're looking at the Pro Stylus, take a look at this light as well.  It's a little bigger diameter-wise...but well worth it in my opinion. 10 out of 5 stars .", "overall": 5.0}
{"reviewText": "I got this sprayer with my Duracoat shake n spray kit, and while at first I was a little hesitant about spraying the slide of my glock 34 with this...I am very pleased with the results. I also duracoated my Blackhawk holster, kydex knife sheath, knife handle, 2 AR-15 magpul magazines, my forward grip, AR buttstock and grip.  And I still have a little propellant left over in the canister.  This is just to show you how much I was able to do with just ONE can.As far as spray... YES, an airbrush would have a finer finish. But the finish on this was good.  Actually REALLY good.  My glock slide isn&#699;t completely smooth, and has a fine texture to it.  At first I wasn&#699;t sure about it...BUT, once I put my gun back together and racked the slide, I realized something...NO FINGER PRINTS on my slide!!!!  I&#699;m ALWAYS wiping down my slide because my friends gun has prints on it that are just STUCK now. So I&#699;m constantly worried about that.  But this finish gives my slide an ever so light texture.  And I like that alot.  On my AR polymer stock and grip it came out smooth.  LIke factory smooth.  I&#699;m sure it&#699;s because it&#699;s the polymer.  But it looks really good.  The kydex to it very well also.  l was very pleased with the results.I rated it 4 stars because I like it and I would love it if it were a little bigger, and came with smaller jars.  That way I could clean out the sprayer, and attach different color jars quickly.  Also, because it&#699;s a canned product, you need to be careful to shoot some out after setting it down for a few minutes to prime the paint thru the system.

Yes, it could be better by being linkable to other LED Pulse&#699;s, and I&#699;m sure there are 3 or 4 other ways it could be better...but then the price would go up and it would be a different animal. So, for what it IS...I LOVE it.With that being said, I bought the light because it was fairly inexpensive, and I wanted to see how it performed, and I&#699;m happy to say: it exceeded my expectations.  The LED&#699;s are much brighter than I expected, and this little (it&#699;s actually not THAT little) unit threw nice LED patterns across the hall, no problem. It covered a really large area.  The strobe function is just ok, nothing to write home about, but it&#699;s another effect built-in, and I like that feature alot.  I really wish it was linkable, but like I said above...it would be a different animal.  I think I might buy another unit, and set them up on the bottom of a T-bar, with my mega pixel LED across the top.

Overall I like this knife.  I bought it to give away as a gift, but I may end up buying another one to keep.I bought the straight blade, not serrated, which is what I prefer. I think the blade steel is decent quality.  It&#699;s the same steel as my Spyderco Tenacious, strong enough, and able to sharpen up fairly easily.  I like the handle grip, it&#699;s very good and feels comfortable in hand. No blade play up, down, or side to side when it&#699;s deployed.  I like the secondary lock on the top of the frame.  That&#699;s a nice added safety feature.  I&#699;m not too keen on the pocket clip.  That looks a little...low-tech if I can say that.  I wish it was a little more agressive looking and not so FAT.  And then the knife overall is a little wide.Other than that I have no real complaints.  These are my first impressions right out of the box...and I haven&#699;t actually put it to use, BUT...I can tell this knife will take a beating. The good news: It&#699;s not a hundred dollar knife that I&#699;ll be afraid to put to hard use.I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it&#699;s a little wider than expected, and that silly looking pocket clip .", "overall": 4.0}
{"reviewText": "I was sort of expecting it to be a little small. But that&#699;s my heads fault, not the product.It&#699;s really lightweight, and looks good.  I think the brim part is a little smaller than expected... but good nonetheless .", "overall": 4.0}
{"reviewText": "Yes I gave it 5 stars.  It&#699;s bright. Not just bright...I mean BRIGHT.  It throws light far!  I was helping to set up a couple of big party tents for an event this past saturday morning...at 4:30AM, and and everyone there had a flashlight or headlamp.  When I turned this little guy on..I was completely blown away at the amount of light it had.  I got a few good comments when it was on the med setting...and when I turned it on HIGH...it blew EVERYONE away that it could even step up a notch! I&#699;ve got regular alkaline AA&#699;s in it now...and it&#699;s STILL really bright.  I&#699;ll be buying lithium AA&#699;s and we&#699;ll see how long those last in comparison and if the brightness is different.  I personally really like the wide beam and how much light it throws.  I like that it&#699;s so slim and light but packs a wallop of light! I also like the length of the light.  It fits nicely in my hand and I can operate it easily with my thumb on the button.  Because I live in Hawaii, it was important to me that this light be waterproof, and built to last. We&#699;re exposed to heavy rain, hot sun, ocean spray and salt water... so I wanted a light that I could accidently drop in a puddle in torrential rain.With that being said, the only thing I wish it had is a side switch/button to change between modes like my other Olight: M20 Tactical Warrior.  BUT...that&#699;s not a deal breaker by any means, I STILL LOVE this light.  I don&#699;t mind twisting the upper bezel to get it to change modes. I&#699;m glad that it stays in the last mode you left it in. I think the lowest setting is a little TOO low.  I don&#699;t imagine when I&#699;d use it.  I keep it on the med setting.  I know there are comparable flashlights that are A LOT more expensive and made in the US... and even less expensive flashlights...but I really liked Olight&#699;s torture test, and how much abuse they can take.  My M20 has been so good to me, and I have had nothing but good experiences with Olight, purchasing this T25 light was an easy choice. The hardest part was choosing between the T20 or the T25.  I picked the T25 because of it&#699;s length.  I think the T20 is a little too short for me personally.So it gets 5 stars from me, and it was well worth the money .", "overall": 5.0}
{"reviewText": "So I bought this for my T25 with high hopes.  I've been extremely happy with my T25 as well as my M20 Warrior flashlights.  My M20 is mounted to my AR, but the T25 I've been using as a hand held for night &#34;ops&#34; (ok it's not really op's....just night boar hunting!)  The green filter actually works great.  I like it a lot.  But I don't like the FIT of the filter on my T25.  It's on..but comes off VERY easily.  As one of the other reviewers stated, only the very top of the inside of the filter is what holds it to the flashlight. I wish it stayed on a little tighter.  I'm giving it 3 stars because it's not a bad product overall, as I said the filter part is good.  It's just that I'm afraid I'm going to lose this thing in the bush one night.My fix: I have a roll of 1/2 inch black gaffer's tape that I strapped around the bottom of the filter, and taped it to my T25.  So far it works.  I haven't been in the rain yet...so we'll see.  Another idea I have is to put a rubber band thru the lanyard hole and run that thru the clip, so hopefully if the filter falls off, it's still attached to the light .", "overall": 3.0}
{"reviewText": "OK so there are a lot of people who rag on Condor as \"airsoft ONLY\" equipment. I completely disagree. Yes, it&#699;s fine for airsoft.  But unless I was going to be deployed...this gear is good enough to do run and gun, or even in a WROL situation it would work fine.  It IS made in China, and yes, sometimes you&#699;re going to run into quality check issues, but for the most part, this rig works great.  And for the price...it earns 5 stars because it&#699;s worth it and then some.  And I know there are a lot of snobs who poke their noses up in the air in regards to Condor, but I have a number of pouches and other gear from them, and I personally think they&#699;re built strong.Now on to the review:I run this chest rig with a Condor rip away EMT bag on my left, and a Condor sidekick pouch on my right, both pouches on either side of the sewn in magazine pouch. I run 4 pistol mags with my flashlight and multitool positioned in the 2 middle pistol mag pouches.  While I can carry 6 AR mags in it, I usually carry 3. With all this gear on, it&#699;s still comfortable enough for all-day use (PLEASE...this is BATTLE GEAR. IT&#699;S NOT SUPPOSED TO BE FLEECE LINED, PARIS HILTON KINDA STUFF!!!) just be sure to set it up right. I&#699;m a big guy wearing a 2x shirt, and this fits me fine.  It would probably fit someone who wears a 3x or maybe even 4x.  (and if you&#699;re a 4x kinda guy...hit the stationary bike once in a while! Trust me, you&#699;ll thank me later.) The molle on this rig fits all of my gear fine, no problems there.  The stitching is heavy duty. Maybe not mil-spec, but heavy duty nonetheless. One thing I like about this rig is that I can put my Condor compact assult pack on my back, and I&#699;m good to go.  *YES...I have a LOT of Condor gear in this loadout but I also have Maxpedition as well as Camelbak equipment on other rigs.So, if you&#699;re being deployed...go with the best you can buy.  If you&#699;re just planning for the zombie apocalypse or run-n-gun training or competition, this will work fine, and you&#699;ll be happy you saved the money.One more thing on Condor:From what I&#699;ve seen and read, their quality has gone up tremendously in the last couple of years.  They&#699;re really making an honest effort to win our business with quality equipment that&#699;s made overseas.  And on top of that, they&#699;ve also started manufacturing some products here in the U.S .", "overall": 5.0}
{"reviewText": "Not a whole lot to say about these patches. I got 5 different ones from Gladsen and Culpeper, and got free shipping.  I think the patches are decently made, with good stitching. The quality on the patches is good, and heavy duty enough.  Not incredibly awesome...but good, and for the price 3 bucks...5 stars because I got 5 patches shipped for FREE .", "overall": 5.0}
{"reviewText": "Ok so this light is NOT 400 lumens.  I&#699;m not sure how they&#699;re getting that...but it&#699;s probably not even 200 lumens.  My Olight T25 which I received in the same order is listed at 210 lumens, and it blows this 400 lumen light away. Next thing that was a little odd: This little flashlight arrived in NO packaging other than a little bubble wrap bag, which was inside of a brown shipping envelope.  There were no packaging or invoice paperwork, no directions, no nothing... But I knew that was probably going to happen based on other reviews I&#699;ve read on this light.  The light is decently bright.  Didn&#699;t blow my socks of by any means.  It&#699;s compact, runs on a single AA battery, and has a decent clip on it.  The focus feature is...nothing really.  I just keep it on it&#699;s brightest setting and leave it.  To cycle between modes you have to quickly press the on/off switch.  I like that it stays in the last mode you had it in.With that being said... I paid 7 bucks for this light with free shipping, and it arrived ahead of schedule, and in great condition.  I cannot really complain because I knew exactly what I was getting.  I gave it 3 stars because it&#699;s just ok.  Nothing special.  Just a decent Cree LED flashlight that runs on a single AA battery.  I would probably buy a couple more to give to my wife/kids to keep in their car/purse/bag. It&#699;s small enough that it doesn&#699;t get in the way too much .", "overall": 3.0}
{"reviewText": "I own a few Condor items: bags, pouches, chest rig... this was the first jacket.  I was a little nervous about buying it online, without actually &#34;seeing&#34; it and putting it on, but I did it.  And I'm glad I did.  I've only had it a couple weeks, but so far I like it. I think for the price, it really gives a lot.  I needed something that would be wind resistant, and offer rain resistance, that was lightweight and breathable. I think this jacket covers all of those needs.  I don't believe it is waterPROOF, but I think it's resistant enough for what I intend to use it for: Hunting, shooting, backpacking in Hawaii.As others have said in their reviews, the zippers as quality as I'd like, but they're ok.  I didn't see any frayed seams or anything like that, and the jacket seems to be well constructed.  For a sub $100 jacket, I think it's well worth the money.Don't compare this to a North Face, Columbia or Patagonia jacket...that's not what this is. You won't get THAT kind of quality and weather resistance in this jacket that's half the price!  Nor is this jacket mil-spec. Don't expect that either.It's an $89 jacket that offers a LOT for that $89 bucks .", "overall": 4.0}
{"reviewText": "This is exactly what I wanted for my Mosin.  It&#699;s the kit, and only thing missing is the little oil container. But no big deal... I run my boresnake thru it instead.  But I got it for the spacer tool for the bolt assembly.  Works good .", "overall": 4.0}
{"reviewText": "This kit has all the stuff you&#699;ll need, (and some stuff you don&#699;t) and it wasn&#699;t extremely expensive.  The only thing I added was an airway for CPR, and some extra bandages of different sizes, and a small tube of antibiotic. There are bandages and single use antibiotic packs...but I needed more.  I use this kit for a summer program in Hawaii, and our kids are always getting small cuts and scrapes because we&#699;re outdoors quite a bit. So bandages and antibiotic are the first to go.I think it&#699;s well laid out, everything is clearly marked, and the clear plastic helps a lot when you&#699;re trying to find stuff. I also like the bright orange color and large print: MEDICAL KIT on the side, makes it easy to locate.  I would recommend this kit to anyone who is going to be outdoors on the water or in the mountains. I gave it 4 stars because I had to add those items, and I&#699;ll probably have to add some sunburn treatment (aloe gel or other), and an instant ice pack or 2, but other than that this kit is good.On a side note... yes I probably could have put together a kit of exactly what I needed so there wouldn&#699;t be any wasted space or unusable items, for about the same price or less...possibly.  But I knew going into this purchase that I was going to add a few things to supplement this kit for my needs so no big deal.  And I was impressed by the layout of the bag, and it&#699;s content.  If you want to see what&#699;s inside, Adventure Medical&#699;s website has some really good video&#699;s on all of their kits .", "overall": 4.0}
{"reviewText": "This fits the Trailmaster Limited perfectly.  I live in Hawaii so I need a cover that is medium to heavy duty, that will keep rain (and in turn...RUST) off my smoker.  I&#699;ve seen a number of YouTube videos of smokers that are totally rusted from being left out in the rain.  If you have a Trailmaster Limited, it fits perfectly and it&#699;s priced right.  The Amazon price was actially less than it is at my local Home Depot.  No tax and free shipping.  Can&#699;t go wrong there .", "overall": 4.0}
{"reviewText": "I bought this knife based on reviews I found on different forums and YouTube. Just google or search YouTube, you&#699;ll find a TON of information and reviews on this knife.  One of the best reviews is by Nutnfancy on YouTube.  Here&#699;s my thoughts:BLADE:AUS8 steel.  It&#699;s decent steel... Sharpens up easily, and keeps an edge.  It was extremely sharp out of the box, and I personally prefer FFG blades, so that was another plus for me.  Nice jimping on the top of the blade that helps with grip when cutting.  The thumb studs are solid.  When closed, the blade on my knife sits exactly centered.  NO blade-play whatsoever.  Up, down, left, right...it&#699;s solid.  The satin finish is nice.  I like how the RAT logo contrasts on the blade.  Very cool.  (I&#699;ve seen reviews on the black finish, and people are saying that it comes off way too easily, and really is there just for looks.  So I&#699;ve decided to stay away from it.) The blade has a nice belly, and is shaped for a lot of different utility tasks.  The blade shape and FFG is one of the main reasons I looked at this knife in the first place.  Well, that and the price.HANDLES:Another reviewer said these were G10.  I don&#699;t think so, and I don&#699;t remember what I read in the blade review forums...but I think it&#699;s Zytel or something.  But it feels like G10.  The finish is really nice on the handles.  The finger choil up front is deep, and it fits my finger in nicely.  It gives good solid control in hand.  It&#699;s not as grippy as my Spyderco Tenacious, but it&#699;s in that same style: sort of a smoothed out grip.  I&#699;m not sure how it will hold up covered in blood (I hunt wild boar) or even just water...that remains to be seen, but I don&#699;t think it will be a problem. (I&#699;ll update this review if it is) I really like the coyote color.  It complements the satin blade very nice.  IF it were G10 handles, the knife would be even MORE AWESOME.  But then again...the price on this knife would probably jump as well.BUILD:Well made. Torx screws hold it all together and the pillar/liner construction looks strong.  I don&#699;t mind that this knife is made overseas.  It&#699;s well done. (Good quality control in manufacturing) I know others have said this, and I agree...if Ontario would have skeletonized the steel liners, that could shave an ounce off the weight.  But the weight (5 oz I believe) is fine to me.  It doesn&#699;t feel that much more heavier than my Spyderco Tenacious in my pocket.CLIP:I like that the clip is 4 way adjustable.  Tip down, Tip up, left, right... you can set it up the way you want.  A definite plus. It&#699;s a long clip too and sits relatively deep in the pocket. The only thing I don&#699;t like is that black paint. I felt that a stainless clip would match the blade better. I&#699;ve seen pics and videos of this exact knife after a year or two of use...and the chipped black finish on the clip looks kinda cool... gives it that &#34;Boba Fet&#34; worn in battle tested look.  So it&#699;s not a deal breaker, and I think over time it&#699;s going to give this knife some personality. If I end up not liking that look...I&#699;ll just take the clip off and buff off the black finish myself.  Easy enough.EDC-ability:It&#699;s a little big for a TRUE EDC knife in my opinion.  But to me, a TRUE EDC blade would be a Kershaw OSO Sweet, or Spyderco Dragonfly, or something similarly sized. (Those are the two I own and carry as EDC, so they&#699;re my only comparisons) BUT, lately I&#699;ve been carrying larger sized blades: Spyderco Tenacious, SOG Flash 2, and now the RAT-1. I don&#699;t feel it&#699;s too big at all. I like that it&#699;s a little bigger, and my EDC blades become medium sized tactical folders. So, YES on the EDC-ability for ME.It was $40 dollars which is a little more than I wanted to pay, (I was hoping for around $30-35) but it&#699;s fine...I figured it was due to the demand for the coyote brown.  For the price...this knife is STILL a very good deal.  Regardless of it being made in Taiwan...it&#699;s well built.  It blows my mind that there are folks comparing this knife to other more expensive blades and complaining about the steel, or not being made in the US, or the lack of G10 scales...??!!  IF this knife were to be made that way...it would be MUCH more than $40 dollars!  So judge it for what it is.  It&#699;s a $40 dollar knife that will take whatever you throw at it.  AND it has a limited lifetime warranty.  Not bad for a budget folding knife made in Taiwan.  (And the plain black handle version can be bought right here on Amazon for $27 bucks!!!)If you&#699;re looking for a HIGH value, MID sized, LOW (to MID) priced, budget (IMO) folder...the Ontario RAT-1 fits that bill. It&#699;s well worth the price. 9 out of 10 for me.  *If the clip was stainless, and the liner skeletonized to drop weight...DEFINITE 10 at $40 bucks for the Coyote handles, and $27 for the black handles!!! Get one .", "overall": 5.0}
{"reviewText": "There are SO MANY reviews on these headphones, and you&#699;ll get all kinds of technical reviews.  But here&#699;s my take:These are good.  There are a few people who say they&#699;re better than Beats...I don&#699;t know about that.  My Beats are great and these are close but not quite. IMHO. Keep in mind, these are &#34;Extra Bass&#34; headphones.  So the bass frequencies are going to have a lot more presence due to the fact that these are tuned that way.  So... don&#699;t expect them to have a flat EQ response across the board.  They&#699;re GOOD, and for $39 bucks...that&#699;s GREAT!  So they get 5 stars for that reason.Let me also say this: I&#699;ve got a pretty big dome.  My fitted cap size is 7-3/4.  Yea Yea Yea...I know.  BUT, I wanted a set of headphones that wouldn&#699;t squeeze my head, or a set that I didn&#699;t have to open them to their farthest most position to wear them.  These... 2-3 clicks on each side, and I&#699;m good.  Oh...and that was a nice touch too.  The little &#34;clicks&#34; so you can be sure they&#699;re even on both sides.IF you&#699;re someone that doesn&#699;t like bass... then don&#699;t get these.  You&#699;ll be tweaking your EQ all day, every day.  I personally like the deeper freq response.  And what I did was set my EQ flat from the lowest freq&#699;s, and then a little higher on the high freq&#699;s.I would recommend this buy to anyone with a big size noggin&#699; looking for headphones that don&#699;t squeeze or pinch your head .", "overall": 5.0}

I like the ability to use both probes, and I also like how it will tell you if the temp in my smoker drops below 220 or if it gets too hot.

{"reviewText": "Ok so when I saw this I was really skeptical, even with all of the good reviews. I wasn't sure that this little angled speaker could put out decent sound...BUT IT DOES! it doesn't sound tinny or weak....and holds up to louder volumes and doesn't distort when you think it will.The first day I got it, i was supposed to do a workout class in a room with a 70\" TV. Unfortunately someone else booked the same room and had 25 people in there for a workshop....so i moved my little workout group of 8 to another room without a TV. I hooked this up to my computer and played the workout DVD (Insanity!) where the instructor is giving directions AND there's music playing...and we had NO PROBLEM hearing all of it.  The room was FILLED with sound! It was the tiny 15\" screen that was difficult!Sure it's not a Bose speaker, or Beats pill, or the new Sol Republic deck.... But for only $39 bucks....I can buy FIVE of these little babies for the price of ONE of those. It just so happens that I saw the commercial for the Sol Deck on the same day I ordered this...and I said to myself: if this doesn't perform, I'll return it. So  I kept the packing material just in case. But after that first emergency use.... I'm sold. I threw all the packing stuff away and I'm keeping it! I can already forsee using it on the beach, poolside, with my laptop when watching a movie, etc.Look... It's bluetooth, battery operated, compact, and inexpensive. It'll even function as a handsfree speaker for your phone! And did I say it was only $39 bucks??!!  BUY WITH CONFIDENCE.  And if you&#699;d rather spend $200-300 bucks on a Bose, Beats, or Sol, go ahead and do it if that&#699;s your budget or preference.

{"reviewText": "Ok, so this is the 3rd one I&#699;ve purchased. I own one, and I&#699;ve given two as gifts.Here&#699;s my take... bass is nothing to write home about.  However, this unit is MUCH better than my phone speaker, so when listening to music on my phone...THIS little oontz is better than what I have.  Does it match the sound quality of a Bose or JamBox?  C&#699;mon... let&#699;s be real.  NO.  But then again, I didn&#699;t spend $200 bucks on it either!  And it&#699;s inexpensive enough, that I bought THREE of them, two to give away.  And the teenagers who have the other two...LOVE IT!The one negative I have is that I don&#699;t believe it actually lasts 10 hours on ONE charge. (I think it says that on the manual I got, but I may be mistaken)  I think it&#699;s more like 6-8 hours. Still though... It&#699;s worth $39 bucks.  If you want something that&#699;s better than your iPhone or Android phone speaker... Get this, and buy with confidence.  If you want better bass, and fuller sound reproduction...then buy the Bose.  For me... $39 bucks for something I can throw in my bag and go to the beach with...or give 2 away as gifts...PERFECT!Update:One odd thing... so these two didn&#699;t come with the little carrying bag.  Not a deal breaker, but my nephews both said the bag wasn&#699;t in the box.  Mine came with a nice little felt bag that you&#699;re able to carry all of the cables in, but theirs didn&#699;t.

Then once he goes to the hospital where Meg works to visit the Children's ward, things start to get interesting. Their relationship has there ups and downs but in the end they fall so in love with each other that you can't help but fall with them.  I like how Kristen Proby writes about the other characters, Luke, Nat, Jules, and Nate in each book.

{"reviewText": "Nassim Taleb writes in a very authoritarian voice.  His tone is frequently at once both pompous and arrogant.  The man is brilliant and he knows it.  He is not shy about letting his reader know it either.  Taleb is brutally contemptuous of those he violently disagrees with being mostly what he terms charlatan and/or fragalista, highly-educated, academic economic pundits that prostitute themselves to business and/or government to perpetuate stupid, destructive ideas and outright fraud either knowingly or unknowingly.  The actual premise of \"Antifragile\" is quite simple in many ways and could essentially be explained in a couple of pages quite thoroughly.  Taleb takes over 500 pages to discuss the concept going all the way through the Index.  The man is multi-lingual and extremely well read, particularly in the classics.  There are hundreds of references throughout the text to works of literature from different centuries, cultures and languages.  Frequently, the connection to the main theme of the book seems a bit stretched but the vignettes are almost always quite interesting and thought provoking.  Taleb has strong opinions on a wide variety of topics and presents them as facts in a harsh, clipped fashion.  Much of what Taleb proclaims is quite outside the norm and at odds with conventional wisdom.  As soon as I started reading \"Antifragile\" I could not stop and read the entire book in one long sleep-deprived session with minimal breaks to walk my dogs.  I savored many passages with feelings similar to scraping the fatty delicious meat off the bone of a perfectly charcoal-grilled T-bone steak with my teeth.  I wanted to reread the book immediately but will force myself to wait a minimum of one year before doing so that I can think about the concept of antifragility using my own references and experience without the bombastic voice of Taleb pounding inside my head.  \"Antifragile\" is probably the best book I have ever read.  It is certainly the most important.  I won't attempt to summarize the main theme of \"Antifragile\".  I would prefer that people read the book for themselves.  I believe every rationale person on the planet should read this book.  If people applied the concept of antifragility as defined in great detail by Taleb their lives would become happier and more successful.  If the world were ruled by numerous city-states governed by the concept of antifragility our planet would become a safer more productive place.  Poverty and hunger would be largely eradicated.  The global economy would be much healthier and there would be little war.  The threat of nuclear holocaust would diminish exponentially.  Nassim Nicholas Taleb has written a book that could significantly change the world for the better.  There is no greater achievement available to an author .", "overall": 5.0}
{"reviewText": "\"Live from Mongolia\" by Patricia Sexton is a fun book with a powerful message to embrace your passions and follow your dreams.  Ms. Sexton walks away from a lucrative, although high-pressured career as a Wall Street banker to become an unpaid intern at a Mongolian television station.  As an ex-investment banker I can appreciate and admire this gutty decision.  The author uses her natural reporter's eye to paint a vivid picture of her adventures in Mongolia.  She deftly mixes in history with her personal narrative to educate and entertain the reader.  After returning to NYC, Ms. Sexton briefly returns to Wall Street, but swiftly realizes that she can no longer sell out for money.  The price is too high and there is too much to lose to walk away from her new passion in life.  This book would make a great Christmas present for high school and college students struggling with what to do with their lives.  The lesson is simple.  Throw caution to the wind, follow your heart's desire and give it everything you got .", "overall": 5.0}
{"reviewText": "Wall Street Journeyman is a remarkable book.  The novel takes us through the life and times of one man's journey to significant success on Wall Street trading desks and the subsequent decline in his career.  The vivid descriptions of his youth and the violence he and his family experienced at the hands of his father are graphic and chilling.  But his relationship with his father was very complicated and the specter of his old man haunts him throughout his life.  The protagonist is obviously brilliant and we hear his thoughts and feel his passion as he rises rapidly in the industry early in his career.  We see a man that is capable of great compassion and kindness, but also ruthless, aggressive behavior.  The protagonist is often quite reckless, but handles adversity with courage and conviction.  He is a man capable of twisted, decadent actions, but also someone that possesses a keen sense of humor and is brutally honest with himself throughout the saga.  The story is full of unexpected twists and turns with significant doses of dark humor.  The description and analysis of the financial industry is excellent.  The reader gets a first-hand look at the phenomenon that was Wall Street during the past twenty-five years.  We learn the kinds of money made by Wall Street professionals and the organization and business strategies of these firms.  We get a true inside look at the industry along with detailed descriptions of the crazy shenanigans and excesses these young, highly paid professionals got involved with.  Wall Street Journeyman is a triumph.  I strongly recommend taking the journey .", "overall": 5.0}

{"reviewText": "This mouse was a major improvement from my old dell wired mouse that I've had for years. It is very lightweight and have 3 sensitivity settings that were very useful. The mouse itself isn't very comfortable in your hand, but like with everything else, you get used to it. I've had this mouse about 8 months when it started to act up. The left and right buttons would start to double click or sometimes wouldn't click at all. There doesn't seem to be anything wrong with the actual buttons, it might just be that the sensor inside the mouse is going bad. It gets very annoying when playing games and greatly affects gameplay. The reason I gave it 4 stars is because you will not find a better mouse for the same price anywhere.P.S. The LED in the mouse stays on even when I turn off my computer which is very annoying and the mouse must be unplugged every night .", "overall": 4.0}
{"reviewText": "The overall design of the mouse is great. It feels very good in your hand and the laser is very precise. Now what I didn't like about it is the weight and the lights. This mouse is noticeably heavier than all the previous mouses that I have owned, which makes it harder to pick up and move but you eventually get used to it. The main reason i gave this mouse a 3 star rating is for the software. It comes with a CD that has the driver for the lights and other settings in the box, but you need to change the name of certain files so that your computer can recognize them because they are originally in Chinese. Another option is to download the drivers in English from Overload Forums, which you have to make an account to get permission to download it. Once you finally get the driver installed, it doesn't even work! The only setting for the lights that does work is the one that cycles through all the colors, which I believe is the &#34;demo&#34; mode. I wanted to change it to solid blue to match my case, but that is not longer an option. Overall, it is a good mouse, but if you are crazy about the lights and being able to adjust setting on the mouse, there are much better mouses out there for this price .", "overall": 3.0}

It even has a die that will do large AWG insulated cord end terminals.  I believe it can go as large as 6 AWG.  Very hard to find one that does large AWG.  As for the ratcheting mechanism and the crimp, it does not come close to knipex crimpers.  I use the knipex master crimper with die sets almost ever day and there is a huge difference.  The crimp action on the Knipex is almost effortless.  I even have a dedicated ratcheting insulated terminal crimper from knipex and it is day and night compared to astro pneumatic. That damn thing only crimps insulated terminals and it's $130.  The problem is, Knipex will not only break the bank, but it will close your account hahaha.  I paid almost $200 just for the master crimper pliers WITHOUT ANY DIES AT ALL!!!  THE DIES ALONE RUN FROM $100-$200.

He always complains that he has to use the old style crimpers with no ratchet where you actually have to squeeze to crimp.  He has some girly hands for a field engineer.  I tried his set out and I was so glad I didn't go cheap on my own tools.  This AP set is great for the auto mechanic or electrician but not for us engineers that hold life and death in our hands.  Sound pretty over dramatic huh?  I would give it a 3.5 but I will round it up to 4 stars.  Amazon, please try and get the Knipex tool prices to go down a bit.  Thanks .", "overall": 4.0}

Disappointing I know; So I contacted Amazon, and they said they'd replace it.. however I had to wait a month to get my replacement.. That sucked literally... but I was happy that they were replacing it so I eagerly and not so happily waited for it to arrive which was  around the 1st of January. Then it arrived I was yet again paired with my travel companion! Well 4 months later it won't charge... again So I contact Amazon and they say they'll replace it even though my warranty is inches from expiring. Today I get my 3rd kindle and it has hyper pixels of bright white light shining through the images. So I contacted amazon once again and now are sending me a 4th Kindle !! 4 KINDLES IN 1 YEAR. That's just ridiculous! The only thing amazon can say is sorry nothing else; that they will forward my complaints to their specialized customer service and go from there... I think that means we'll just throw it in a folder with everyone else's complaints; because we are still making money here.  Its really disappointing, that I am on number 4. I am sure Amazons' CEO doesn't care, because they still have good sales. So who cares! Shame on Amazon.... All of my friends have kindles, and they all have had to have them replaced at least once, some of them twice, and the feedback forums are full of unsatisfied customers, Amazons not making it as right as they could be .", "overall": 2.0}

{"reviewText": "Throw all my favorite Disney movies in a mixer, add the talents of a great writer and some dystopian dust (you know, like fairy dust. Haha.), mix it up and voila! I got myself a brand favorite book of the year that makes my inner child come to life again (aka run around screaming with her arms in the air in a pink princess dress and a fake crown on her head). Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you: THE SELECTION!\"I hope you find someone you can't live without.I really do. And I hope you never have to know what it's like to have to try and live without them.\"I think it's obvious already that I loved this book. In case it wasn't, well, I did. I do. I love the story and the characters and everything about it! America is such a great main character, someone I could relate to in many ways. If I were to live in her world, I would be like her. A five. Only three steps up from nothing. But while she doesn't want to be a princess, I have always dreamed of it since I saw my first disney film so many years ago. I loved her and she would make a great Disney princess! (This book would be awesome as an animated Disney film, too.)Now I shall talk about the first fictional character ever I fell in love with. (Seriously I shed a tear because I knew he wasn't real. Sigh.) Of course I'm talking about Maxon. He's so... Maxon. Sigh again. Maxon.Okay moving on. Aspen. I loved him at first. So romantic and loving and caring and then... a complete stupid douchebag. I hate him.Speaking of hating someone... I hated Celeste. She's so mean and stuck up and bleh. But I loved Marlee and May and all the other characters!As I said, I loved this story. We got to know America while the story builds in the beginning until the inevitable moment she gets chosen for The Selection. She stays true to who she is and never forgot where she came from, another thing I loved about her by the way. She's different from the other girls in many ways and refuses to change for anyone. I loved how the relationship between her and Maxon grew along with the story and I fell for Maxon along with America. And when they kissed my inner child was so happy she fainted. Yes, that happens.But not everything is rainbows and sunshine in the palace. There are these rebels, what their purpose is we have yet to find out, who form a threat to the royal family and I liked that. That's what gives it an extra dystopian touch. But life goes on in the palace and I loved every part of it! Until that douchebag Aspen came back into the story and messed things up again. I hope for him that he doesn't mess things up in the next book or else... Well not much he is a fictional character so I can't do much... But if he were real, I would kick is ass. For sure.So in the end, this book is everything I hoped it would be and more. I can't wait to start the sequel (luckily I don't have to since I just got a copy from Netgalley, yay!). Great job Kiera! I LOVE YOU .", "overall": 5.0}
{"reviewText": "Well... I regret reading this book now. Because now I probably have to wait way to long for the sequel! That's just mean! I want it! I want it now!*Ahem* I guess you could say that I liked this book. No actually I didn't like it. I loved it! It was everything I hoped it to be and more! So So So SOOOOO AWESOME!The story starts almost right after the first book and the characters I fell in love with (some more than I should) or grew to hate so much (*cough*Celeste*cough*) are still here and I'm sooo happy! In this book we learn more about the history of the land through Diaries from Gregory Illea and we see a bit of a darker side of it. We get to know the King and Queen more in this book, which was awesome. I love Queen Amberly, she's so nice! But I hate the King. I really do. Almost as much as I hate Celeste, that *peeeeep*. Bleh.America is still awesome, even though maybe a little more emotional in this one. I get that I was too. I was so torn and I am just reading the book. If I were America, I would be crying all the time. But she is still true to herself and never forgets were she comes from and she isn't afraid to fight for what she thinks is right. And I'm glad she has support from some people in the palace. Now why is she so torn? Guys of course...Maxon... Sigh. My emotions were scrambled up good in this book, and that's mainly because of him. First I still love him, than I don't like him so much, than I do, than I hate him, and in the end I loved him again. Yeesh... I mean... I get that he needs to find a wife, but if he really loves America, like he says, why kissing those other girls? Okay yeah, sometimes America is to blaim for that one to because she pushes him away constantly (something I don't understand by the way... I would never push him away), but come on Maxon... Kissing Celeste? Seriously? If I could I would kick you right in your royal parts. But I can't stay mad at him for long, so...And then there's Aspen. Yeah he's a douchebag but at least he is a one-woman kind of guy and he fights for America. Something I admire. And it's romantic... So you see why America is so torn? I certainly am... But I still think I'm team Maxon.Oh and I love her dad! He made me cry quite a bit in this book with those letters he wrote to America. Wish I had a dad like that.And Marlee... I'm soooo not going to talk about her. I'll cry again.So yeah, this was awesome. I loved it. I want the sequel .", "overall": 5.0}
{"reviewText": "Oh my god. That's about the only thing I can come up with now. Oh my god. This book was so... Brilliant, original, heartbreaking, sad, happy and full of love and friendship. I may have a new favorite for this year!This book is about Addie. She lives in a Compound, a place where people with abilities live. It's top secret and the Norms, normal people, don't know about it. Addie can see where certain paths take her in the future when she has to make a choice. When her parents tell her they will be getting a divorce, she has to choose to stay with her mom or her dad, who is leaving the compound to live in Norm world. In one future she is pursued by the hottest guy in school, Duke, but she never wanted to be a quarterback's girlfriend. In the other one she's adjusting to live outside the Compound with her dad. She meets Trevor, a cute, sensitive and sweet artist and he understands her. But when her father is asked to consult in a murder in the Compound, she's drawn into a dangerous game that threatens everything and everyone she loves. Love and loss in both lives, but she has to choose which one she wants to live through and who she can't live without.This was such an amazing story. The writing is so great and the world where Addie lives in is so original. I loved how the author chose to indicate which future it was at the beginning of each chapter. This story was build so great and both futures blended together in so many ways, especially near the end and I know she must have worked on this a long time and thought it through about a hundred times. So amazing! The romance in this book was beautiful. I believed it and there was no insta-love or anything like that View Spoiler I loved the characters too. Addie is so cool. I wish I had her power sometimes. And I feel for her too, but I know she makes the right choice in the end. Laila is such a vibrant and funny character! And Trevor may be my new book-boyfriend. All of them were great, even the bad ones, who I still hate. Well developed and surprisingly realistic for people who have abilities (well, not all of them of course). Awesome.I highly recommend this book to everyone. It's a must-read for sure. And I'm so glad I have the hardcover because I will re-read it many times in the future and I love the cover too. Just awesome. And Brilliant. And breathtaking. Read it. NOW .", "overall": 5.0}
{"reviewText": "4.5 starsKasie West has done it again. She just blew me away. Although in a way, I think I expected it. Pivot Point was so great that this one just had to be great too. It's awesome and made me feel all fluffy and light. Seriously brilliant. The characters, the writing, the story... Amazing!The Distance Between Us is about Caymen and Xander. Caymen is an only child and lives with her mom above their doll store. They don't have an easy life and it's hard to get around with the little money they have. Now Xander, he's the opposite. He's pretty rich and handsome at that. But you know what they say... Opposites attract! But will it last?God, what can I say about this book that hasn't already been said in other reviews. This book was so great. I loved all of it. I knew the writing would be really good. I mean, it was great in Pivot Point, so. And I expected the story to be good too. And it is. It's sweet, romantic, breathtaking and full of cute moments. Those dates Caymen and Xander went on were so weird and original! Well, they didn't call it dates, but that's what they were. And I loved that. And it wasn't insta-love. Their relationship grew and when to romance finally came, it was sooooo amazing. And they don't tell each other `I love you' immediately, which also is a great thing because I don't like that very much and it's not realistic. But this book was!Of course I loved the characters. Even the minor ones. I mean, Skye and Henry were awesome and so funny! And Mason... Yeah he was okay, but I didn't really like him that much. I didn't know whether I liked Caymens mom or not. Sometimes she was pretty annoying, but in the end I got why she acted the way she did. And I liked Xander's family!I loved Caymen. I really did. Her humour was just... hilarious. Probably because mine is also dry and sarcastic, so I got all of her jokes and I laughed out loud a lot so. She's *exceptionally* good at it. And she was very relatable, which made the character more real! But there was one thing that really bugged me. Her attitude towards rich people. Actually, that bothered me with her mom too. They made it such a big deal and the stereotypes were just stupid. So he's rich, so what? But hey, that's the only thing in the entire book, so. And Xander is awesome. He's so perfect for Caymen and I really loved him. He was funny too! Their conversations made me laugh and giggle out loud. (Not fun when I was reading on the bus and people stared at me...) Guess first impressions aren't always right, which is kind of the message in this book I think.Amazing book with a breathtaking, sweet and cute romance. But not just love, also friendship and a very good message about how first impressions can be very wrong. Kasie West, I won't think twice about buying one of your books ever again. I'm just going to do it. So is my copy of Split Second on its way already or .", "overall": 4.0}
{"reviewText": "This review contains a few spoilers for the first two books in the series, Cinder and Scarlet. If you have not read them yet&#8230; I suggest you do that now, because you&#8217;re missing out. There also may be a few minor ones for Cress.Oh my stars, this was awesome. This is by far the best book of the series so far, for me personally. I loved it so much! I read it the minute I got it in my mail and I finished it that same day. Could not put it down. Cress is a action-packed, brilliantly written, amazing, wild roller coaster ride. And as soon as all of it has processed in my mind and I have written this review, I will go and cry because I will have to wait for a whole year for Winter.Cress is the third book in the Lunar Chronicles. In it we first meet Cress. She is a very talented hacker and has lived in a satellite for years as a prisoner, working for the Lunar Queen. But she has other plans and calls for help from our beloved gang. Cinder, Thorne, Wolf and Scarlet go to her rescue, but stuff happens and they get separated from each other. Cress and Thorne are catapulted down to Earth in the satellite, Scarlet is taken by Cress&#8217;s mistress, Sibyl to Luna and Cinder and Wolf manage to escape in their ship to Africa where they meet with Dr. Erland. The clock is ticking and they have to find each other again and make a plan to stop Queen Levana.Yes, it is as awesome as it sounds. My heart was racing the entire time and I just had to keep on reading. While the other two books were a bit predictable, Cinder more than Scarlet, this one was not. Which had me sitting on the edge of my seat for all of the 550 pages. I think that&#8217;s why I loved this one the most so far. The writing is still incredible and really, I bow to you Marissa. I really do. There is not much of a recap, so if it has been a year since you&#8217;ve read the other books&#8230; shame on you! You could&#8217;ve done a marathon and then crawl to a corner and cry like the rest of us because of the long wait for Winter. Seriously though&#8230; A year? I don&#8217;t compute.So stuff happens when they rescue Cress and they are separated. Scarlet is taken to Luna as a prisoner and even though she didn&#8217;t have a lot of story in this book, it&#8217;s still really intense. Especially towards the end. My god, Marissa, you are merciless! Which brings me to Thorne and Cress. When they crash to Earth (of course they don&#8217;t die, the book would be over if they did, so it&#8217;s not a spoiler), something happens to Thorne which makes him blind. At first I was raging mad at Marissa for doing that, because well&#8230; we all love Thorne. But he still is the same arrogant handsome jerk we all hate because we love him, so it&#8217;s all good. They are stranded in the desert and I loved how they bonded. And Cress&#8217;s first moments on Earth were actually pretty funny, because it reminded me of Rapunzel in the Disney movie Tangled when she first came out of her tower. (Yes, the song would fit perfectly for that moment in the book too.) Overall, Cress was pretty similar to Rapunzel from Tangled, which I loved because I love that movie. You know, she&#8217;s a bit awkward around other people because she&#8217;s been alone for all those years except for a few visits from her mistress. She&#8217;s funny and yes I can picture her defending herself with a frying pan. But she&#8217;s also an amazing hacker and a really great character and I loved her.Then we come to Cinder and Wolf. Wolf also doesn&#8217;t have much of a story because he&#8217;s knocked out for one part of the book and practically a zombie the other part. He worries about Scarlet, which does give him some character development. Cinder has a lot of pressure on her shoulders and in this book, she&#8217;s really scared and worried. What if she can&#8217;t save the world? What if her plan goes horribly wrong? And I loved that too because it means that she&#8217;s no Mary Sue and it makes her more human too. But of course, she&#8217;s still a bad ass cyborg Lunar princess so she kicks ass when she has too.That leaves us with the other minor characters. There&#8217;s a new one (sort off), Jacin Clay. He&#8217;s a Lunar Guard who actually helped Cinder and Wolf escape from the satellite. He&#8217;s mentioned in the first book too if I remember correctly. Then we have Dr. Erland, also from book one. He&#8217;s in Africa, where Cinder meets up with him and he also has a storyline, which I&#8217;m not going to talk about because that&#8217;s a spoiler. So I&#8217;ll move on to Kai, who I love again! In Scarlet, I had a love-hate relationship with him, but not anymore. He&#8217;s a prince and he&#8217;s hot and he actually does things right in this book. Well, for the most part anyway. That leaves us with&#8230;. Levana. Yeah, still hate her. I&#8217;m not going to talk about all the other side characters, but I do want to mention one of them because she has a pretty big role in the fourth book! Yes, Winter makes an appearance towards the end. I won&#8217;t spoil anything about it, all I&#8217;ll say is that she&#8217;s not what I thought she would be, in a very good way. And it makes me even more excited to read the next book.Stars, it seems I have a lot to say about these books. They are just so brilliant and I love them so much and I try to avoid thinking about how long the wait is for Winter. But time goes by very quick for me these days, so 2015 will be here before I realize. At least, that&#8217;s what I hope. Of course I recommend this book! Fans of the series so far won&#8217;t be disappointed and if you are&#8230; I think you read another book. So if you haven&#8217;t had the chance to start this one yet, brace yourself because you&#8217;re in for a wild ride .", "overall": 5.0}
{"reviewText": "*ARC provided by Harlequin Teen via NetGalley. Thank you so much!*4.5 stars!Well, I think it's obvious... The first and most important question: WHY HAVEN'T I READ ANYTHING BY JULIE KAGAWA YET??? I really don't know. Geesh, this woman is awesome! I love her writing. She creates an amazing world in this novel and I actually get details on the worldbuilding, which is awesome. She fascinates me from the start and she got the vampires really good in this one. Okay the story seemed a mix of I am Legend, True Blood and a sniff of Hunger Games, but that's not bad, is it? No! It's more awesome!But seriously... A world were books are illegal? Just hang me already. I wouldn't last a day there. No books? No no no no no no. That's not how I roll. I need ma books okay? But I loved every part of this book. Part 1 was good, part 2 was better and part 3 was awesome. So yeah. You get it. It got better and better every chapter.Okay, the characters. I love Allie. I love her as a human and as a vampire. She's a kick-ass heroine all right. She's stubborn and she can really kick some ass if she needs to, but she's also caring and loving and she doesn't want to hurt anybody, even as a vampire.I liked Lucas and Stick, and I loved Kanin, even when I didn't knew his name yet.

{"reviewText": "Sequels are always hard to write. People usually have high expectations if the first book was really awesome (which is was in this case) and it's difficult to live up to those expectations of all of your fans. But Julie Kagawa did exactly that, because this book is AWESOME!Yeah I use that word a lot, but it's true! Allison still is badass, but she annoyed me a bit in the beginning. I get it, she misses Zeke and to be honest, I would too, but come on... Just kick some ass and maybe you'll get to see him again! She struggles to keep her humanity and control her vampire side and doesn't always succeed in that. So I still love her!It was cool to get to know the other characters better too and see some old ones from the first book return! I did miss some of themJulie's writing still is beyond brilliant. I love how she describes the world she has created and in this novel we get more details of that world, which is great because it helps me to get more into the story! She keeps me on the edge of my very comfy couch and really hooks me to the story in a way not many authors can. And she can make me swoon with some scenes. I seriously was reading with a big smile on my face at times. She can take my breath away and crush my heart at the same time. (Thanks for that...)Of course she left me hanging at the end, which I kind of expected from her, but it sucks nonetheless...I give this book 4 stars because the slow beginning and Allison's references to Zeke in the first few chapters were a bit annoying but it's a great book and those who love the first one, will love this one just as much .", "overall": 4.0}
{"reviewText": "Oh my god... This book was incredible. A truly compelling story with fascinating creatures, realistic characters and a mind-blowing romance. And really the only thing that I didn't like was the big info dumps you get sometimes but I'm willing to look past that just for Ink. Sigh. My Ink.Normally this is the part where I give a short summary of the story but with this book I can't do that without telling you the whole thing and make it one giant spoiler. So I'm going to skip that part just to talk about the book itself. First off all, great writing. Dawn managed to suck me in right from the first page and she didn't let me go until the book was finished. Even now, an hour after finishing it, I'm still in the story with my head. It was so fascinating and wonderful. I love this book. But like I said, I got some big info dumps and while it was all very interesting and I wanted to know more the first time, but after a few of those dumps, I was kinda like... \"Hmm. Okay. So when am I going to get more of Ink and Joy?\"Ink and Joy. God, I love those two. They were so compelling and realistic and just awesome. Their relationship was a bit bumpy at the beginning, no wonder if you see how it started. Joy gets sucked into his world without even realizing what is going on just because of a mistake Ink made. And nobody else can see him so that makes it all the more complicated. But you feel the tension between them and after a while, I felt tense too every time there was a scene were they were so close to the romance-part. I waited long for the real romancy stuff to kick in and when it did... I felt like I was melting inside with the tension and everything. I constantly felt like I was about to faint when Ink and Joy were together. I felt lightheaded and compelled and it took my breath away every single time.I loved Joy. She handled all this in a way that I can relate too. And she has some serious family stuff to deal with next to all that mysterious stuff. She was nice to read about and she's a fun main-character. And Ink. God... He was so compelling and I had a strange connection with him. Weird to say, but I did. He was such an amazing character and it was so interesting to see him learning to feel like a human and I felt for him. It wasn't hard to like him. Same with his sister, Inq and Joy's friend Monica. And her dad. He's such a great dad.And then the end. The last 40 something pages. Ooooh my god I was on the edge of my seat screaming and getting heart attacks and asthma and everything. And again, Ink and Joy... Swoon, Sigh, Faint, Die. I still feel tense.Now this is a book where I wouldn't have minded if there was insta-love. I would've understood it 100% just because of Ink. But I loved the tension and everything. I loved the feels I got from this book. So I recommend it to everyone. This is an amazing book. It really is .", "overall": 5.0}
{"reviewText": "This was such a nice surprise! I went into One Man Guy with mixed expectations and I just ended up loving it to bits. It's such a surprisingly light and fun summer read. In one word: adorable.One Man Guy tells the story of Alek. Alek's family is Armenian and very much grounded in their own traditions. Alek doesn't always feel like he belongs though. When his parents force him to go to Summer School, his whole summer seems to be ruined. But then the cool and handsome Ethan notices him and Alek's summer just got a whole lot better. Ethan seems to want more than just be friends, but what does Alek want?Wow, talk about diversity! This book is not only about a young man/boy discovering he's gay. It's also about that boy's Armenian heritage. I was surprised by how much I loved that aspect of the book! I was a bit hesitant about it going into the book, but Michael won me over immediately! The stuff we learn about the Armenian people was really interesting and yes, I did get a bit hungry from all that talk about the foods they have. Makes me want to try Armenian food.While this may not be the best writing ever, it's still very good. I was sucked into the story right from the start and it didn't let me go! Alek was such a great main character and I liked him a lot! I think a lot of people can relate to him. He's stuck between being who his parents want him to be and being who he really is. I really did feel for him and with him. I was just as annoyed by his parents as he was and I loved that! His parents were a bit annoying at first. They really stick to their traditions and beliefs and while I respect that, it did annoy me a bit. They grew up in America themselves so they can expect their kids to be a bit more modern than they are too! But they grew a lot in this book and I really liked that! Alek's brother Nik, who seems like the perfect son, also grows! The character development in this book is fantastic! Everyone grew in this book. They all learned from their mistakes.I loved Becky, Alek's best friend. She was fun, quirky, a bit of a nerd, ... She's such a great friend to Alek and I loved their friendship. It felt so real and genuine. And then you have Ethan. I loved him so much. He's confident and free spirited. Almost the opposite of Alek. He has a really good influence on Alek, learning him that it's not wrong to want something and be yourself. Their romance was absolutely perfect. It built up slow in the first half and the second half was just one swoon-worthy moment after another. So sweet and adorable!One Man Guy is a very fun, sweet, adorable summer read that I'd recommend to everyone who loves a good contemporary romance book with a little more diversity in it. I loved it and I can't wait to see what the author brings us next! And yes, Kat, I did want to hug everyone in this book by the end .", "overall": 5.0}

Thrillers, detectives, ... Books like that I've read. But never something like this. This book was scary, sweet, heartbreaking, gross and scary again. It made me sit at the edge of my seat clinging to my eReader. It hooked me and I couldn't shake it off. I was thinking about it when I was trying to sleep. I'll have to start reading another book and even then I'll still be thinking about it. That's how good this was. (And scary. And gross.)Come on, be honest. That's enough to make a person curious about the book and that's just one sentence! This book starts of with a bang. A scary and gross bang, but still a bang. It had my attention immediately. It builds up and even breaks your heart sometimes. It definitely isn't a story for the faint hearted. So if you're easily scared and don't like gross details, don't read this book because it has a lot of gross and scary parts. Seriously. Gross, scary, what-was-the-author-thinking parts. And the ending... Geesh... The ending. It broke my heart again.Now the characters. Like I said, Cas really reminded me of one Dean Winchester, but that is not a bad thing. Cas is badass, sweet, caring, funny and he isn't perfect not at all. He is insecure and scared sometimes. Of course he is. And I really love him for that. And I love his mom. She's not just another random character. She really brings something to the story and she is so cool! Oh and I have to say that I love Thomas and Carmel too. They are the first real friends Cas gets in his life and I really like them. They too, mean something in this story. I love this book for that. No characters just to fill up gaps. Every character means something!And yes, I'm going to talk about her to. Anna. Anna dressed in blood. I'm not going to give away anything about her story, you'll have to read the book for that. But it broke my heart.

{"reviewText": "Damnit Sarah, now you've made me cry all sorts of tears. Guess you're on my list of Authors who made me cry now.

After her brother died, she goes to his home in San Diego, far away from her home in Tennessee. There she meets Jhett. A friend of her brother. And then Charlie's life changes and her parents are not to fond of that.I loved this story. A lot. I liked Charlie. In a way she reminded me of myself. (Except for the fact that I don't have rich parents.) She's pretty shy and has always lived the life her parents wanted her to live. Her brother never wanted that so he moved to San Diego and he wanted her to move there to, but she never took that step. Until she meets Jhett. More on him later. I loved seeing Charlie grow as a person. She can be pretty stubborn and I loved hearing that Tennessee accent in my head when she was angry.Jhett. Oh my god.... He's yummy. I love him. He's awesome. I want him.The writing is very good, which I had hoped because I didn't want to hate this story. Sarah is a friend of mine and I'm so glad that she did so well! Yeesh, she even made me cry. Really cry! That's hard to accomplish with me (over a book, that is... series or films, no problem.), so you can say that she is a real new upcoming talent! I felt everything Charlie and Jhett felt and I loved them so much. I loved the fact that there is actual character development in this book! They both grow because of each other. Awesome. But I hate Charlie's mom. God, she's an awful woman.So yeah, I loved this book. I'm a beta reader for it, so maybe things will change in the editing process, but it's awesome nonetheless. Read it. It comes out next month and you can win a copy in the big giveaway I'm having at the end of June! (Or sooner .", "overall": 5.0}
{"reviewText": "3.5 starsThis book was better than I expected. Yeah, the fact that it's about elemental powers has something to do with it and the fact that the main character has the power of my favorite element, fire, has a lot to do with it, but it was just a good book overall.Yeah, I think this review will be a bit short, but I don't have a lot to say about it, so. And it's not a bad thing! The story was good, the writing was good, the romance was good. It was just a good solid book! And yeah, pretty original too. And I'm happy the author gave me a chance to read it. I loved the world she build in this book and how she handled the paranormal stuff in it. Yeah, elemental powers are a weakness of mine, so it was hard to not like this book. But if it wasn't that good, I would've been honest about it. Not everyone can get it right, but Jessie did.I liked the characters, they were pretty well-developed and I liked most of them. Kiarra is cool, with the power of fire and all that. Wish I was her. Or rather, wish I had her power. Jaxton was.... yum first of all. He was cool and I loved getting to know him. And I loved Neena too. Again, all of the characters were great. And I can't wait to see what happens next, what their new adventure is.The book is the start of a new series and I'm pretty excited about it. I want to know what happens next!

This will be one of those review I hate to write, but sometimes you just have to.So... yeah... This book was not that good. Not what I expected at all. Basically this book is about Maddie. She is new at college and in the beginning of the book we meet her when she is getting her annual tattoo. She does that too numb the pain of her parents murder seven years ago. Sounds like a cool character, doesn't it? Well, it isn't. She sounds like a cool chick with issues, but actually she's a naive (or dumb) 18-year old girl who never watches tv, never had a cell phone before and don't know what 'kinky' means. Yeesh. Talk about unrelatable. That wouldn't bother me if I had seen more of the traumatised, broken side of her that witnessed her parents murder. But I rarely saw that. 80% of the time she is just a normal (stupid, dumb and naive) girl. Yeah... No.Then we have Kyle. His dad is the one who killed Maddies parents al those years ago. I didn't like him either. Just another stereotype boy that has some issues he never deals with and instead only thinks of sex. *Yaaaawn*The rest of the characters were not all that memorable for me, so that's not good either.The romance in this story is one of the main things. Maddie has been in love with Kyle for years because they used to be best friends when they were young. I hoped for a good romance here, but it was just kissing and no bonding most of the time. Yeah, that doesn't do it for me. Especially when I got the background on how they used to be. They made some kind of pact when they were eleven to be each others firsts. First kiss, first date, etc,... And when they see each other again after so many years, no bonding and catching up at all? Another let down in this book. Sigh. Oh and I for one, could never fall in love with a guy whose father killed my parents. Maybe I'm just weird for that. *shrugs*The writing.... Well... I've read much better. Really. The double POV didn't work for me. At all.If you expect a great, uplifting book about hope, forgiveness, love, drama, etc,... Don't hold your breath, because that's not what this book was for me personally. I am really sorry, but I just didn't like this book at all. It's a shame though... I like the cover and the blurb made it sound so interesting... *sigh* I'm sorry for the negative review. I really don't like doing this .", "overall": 1.0}

And know I know, and I want to know what happens next!The writing was as good as it was in the first book, maybe even better. Karen Hooper is one of those really talented writers who can hook me to a book and let me stay up late because I just can't stop reading. I really love her and I love this series. It's so awesome! In this book we get to know a little more and we get to know new characters. There's action, romance, friendship, drama,... It's all there. And I still want to know more. Why did Maryah erase? That's the main question. Some of the questions are answered in this book, but most of aren't, which is good, because it makes me, as a reader, curious for more.What's also awesome, is that you can choose in this book! You want a cliffhanger? Or rather not? You can choose in this book! (Just read it and you'll understand.) I do recommend reading the first book before this one, because it starts right where the last one left off and you won't understand a thing in this book. There's no recap here. (So more time for the story to get on! Yay!) But since these books are awesome, it won't be time wasted.I know this review is not very long, but I can't say much else without spoiling the whole thing.

{"reviewText": "Okay, up until the last chapter, this book was pretty standard with a little twist in it. A girl on the run from something or someone, meets a hot, very rich guy on the plane that is instantly obsessed with the girl, but has his own issues and past. And then the last chapter threw a one big twist in my face that leaves me with one giant questionmark.Escaping Reality is about Amy Bensen. Amy has gone through something in her past and now she's running for it. New name, new home, new life. And while running again after six years of peace, she meets Liam Stone on the plane. He's a very handsome, very rich and very talented architect. And he's instantly obsessed with Amy. They start a passionate affair, but Amy keeps doubting if she can trust him at all.Like I said before, this book is pretty Fifty Shades-like in the beginning. Except for the big mystery behind Amy herself, which I'm still figuring out after finishing the book. The writing was okay, the story was... yeah standard. The only thing that makes it a bit different from all the other books in the genre is the mystery behind Amy. Which, luckily, is enough to keep my interest up, but after a while, that stops. Nothing really happened until the very end and that wasn't enough in my opinion. Yeah sure, it gives me some questions, and I do want to know the answers, but still...The characters were.... Okay? Liam is very Christian-like and basically, I'm getting sick of that type. Rich, hot, issues from the past, obessed with the main girl for some reason,... Honestly, if I were in those situations as those girls in the books are when they meet the rich, hot guy, I'd run away from them. I don't need some obsessed guy who wants to own me. So no, I didn't really like him. As for Amy... Well she was somewhat the same as the girls in the other books. They throw back feminism by hundreds of years and I don't like that for one bit.So basically it's pretty standard and despite that, I do want to read the sequel because I need answers to those questions. I recommend this book to people who love Fifty Shades of Grey and other books like that .", "overall": 3.0}

It didn't seem all that original with the vampire-loves-human-thing, but I am so glad that this book wasn't what I expected for once. Because this was a really good book. Wait... What am I saying? It's not good. Not at all. IT'S AWESOME!Yeah you saw that right. This is an awesome book. And you know what? It actually turned out to be pretty damn original. I love the vampires in this book and the whole soulmate-thing. Throw in a witch and your settled for a good time reading this book. The writing is also great. I mean, seriously. Ashley has a way with words and when I read this book she kept me guessing until the end. I loved the mysteries and unanswered questions that hooked me to the story. Good job Ashley!I love Amelia. She's awesome. Yeah, she had a hard life and she had a lot to deal with but she's also a stubborn, strong young woman and she doesn't like to be controlled. (Unlike some other characters in vampire-books... *cough*) She fights the bond even though it may hurt her and I like that about her. And in the end, she learns why her life was as s***ty as it was. So yeah, great main character: CHECK!Of course I loved Mitchel and Angelle and Eric and Luke and... All of them. The good guys were great and the bad guys were great. It's all great.

I wanted to like this book so much because it seemed so great and it is pretty good, but I guess something just didn't connect me to the novel. Weird. Maybe this isn't really my type of book.If you love this genre, I really recommend it! It's a great book and fans of the genre will love it.

If you haven't, you will when you have. This book is so... my god I still can't find the right words.Another 15 minutes later...Okay I'm ready now. This book was heartbreaking and so beautiful. It's one of the best I've read this year. While I was reading, I was laughing, crying and speechless. It was both sad and uplifting. It's a story about coping with loss, grief, regret, making mistakes and trying to fix them. But it's also a story about friendship, forgiveness and love. Brilliant, just... brilliant.I didn't understand that at first, but I did once I finished the book. I get it know. So does Kacey. Kacey is the main character in this story. Four years ago she was in a terrible accident in which she lost so much. Since then, she has never been the same. But she still has her sister Livie. They move to Miami to escape their aunt and uncle and to start over. That's not easy, of course. They meet their neighbors, Storm and her daughter Mia. Storm helps Kacey get a job as her co-worker. A bartender in a strip-club. And they meet Trent. The hot guy from appartement 1D. But Kacey still has to deal with her past and she doesn't let anybody come to close to her. Somehow Trent finds a way to crawl under her skin, but he too has some skeletons in his closet. I can't talk about that because it's a huge spoiler and you have to read the book and feel everything without knowing what'll happen. So no more about that. The writing was excellent. Absolutely without a doubt. This woman has a lot of talent. Can't wait to start the sequel.I loved Kacey. She was so awesome, seriously. Yeah, she has some major issues to deal with, but that's understandable, isn't it? She went through a lot and honestly, I don't blame her for coping with it the way she did. I wouldn't even have survived it. She really is tough. Oh, I love her sarcasm and the fact that she can kick some ass, literally.I also loved Livie, although we didn't get to know her that well. Still, she's cool for a fifteen-year-old. Oh and Storm. Who would've thought that a blond barbie with huge tits who works in a strip club could be so awesome? But she is, she really is. She's caring and nice and so sweet. She's a great friend and an even greater mom. I really love her.Now we talk about the guy. The hot guy from appartement 1D. He wasn't what I expected. At all. At first, I thought he'd be one of those hot guys that fixes the troubled girl with sex. But he's not that guy. He's a sweet, caring and loving man and a gentleman. I never would've guessed that. But... no I can't talk about that because it's a big fat spoiler, so I'm not going to say anything. But in the end, my opinion about him is still the same.Basically I loved all the characters. Cain, the owner of the club where Storm and Kacey work, is so cool. He's not a stereotype! Hurray! I loved them all and I will remember them for a long time.By writing Ten Tiny Breaths K.A.

I really felt what the characters felt and I loved with them, cried with them, laughed with them... I loved the fact what holding hands for the first time did to Eleanor and Park. They were so cute together and by the time I was halfway through the book, I was just waiting for them to kiss and when they did, I just melted and was trembling the whole time for the rest of the book. And then I cried and cried and cried... And then I was confused. Seriously. I have no clue how this book ends, the last chapter was just soooo confusing.I love how the relationship between Eleanor & Park grows. You can practically see them falling in love and you just can't not love them. You just have to love them. Just have to. I loved Park. For some reason when I first imagined how he would look, Zuko from Avatar The Last Airbender, came to my mind. Without scar that is. Don't know why. He just did. And Eleanor is so cool and different and not the stereotype perfect-looking skinny girl. I like a girl with a little meat on her bones. YEAH! Go Eleanor! You rock! Plus, red hair... Duh, that's just awesome. I love this. But still, confused about the end.So that's what I think of this. I want to thank TT for recommending this awesome book.

Still have nothing, so I'm just going to ramble a bit and sometimes these kinds of reviews are the most fun to read. But I did love this book. A lot. And it might just have a place in my top 14 of this year already.First of all, this is such an original story. I'm not going to give a summary because of what I just said. My thoughts are all jumbled up and I can't get them straight so. But the main character is pretty cool. The story is cool and the idea of The Archive is so original. I was sucked in from the first page and I just read it pretty much in one sitting (with some breaks here and there). There are two kinds of narrations, both Mackenzie. One is just the present and the other is I think the past. It's like her diary to her dead grandfather who learned her all about the Archive and all that stuff. It was pretty cool and it wasn't annoying, it really helped the story along. There is a bit of a romance, but it's secondary and I loved that. And it wasn't really a big romance. It was nice because there was a lot going on for Mackenzie and she has more important stuff to do.I really liked the characters in this book. They were all important to the story and I wanted to know more about them. I just... I was sucked into that world with those people and the mystery in it all. Mackenzie is a great main character. I loved her. And I felt for her. I also loved Wesley, he's cool and awesome. I'm not going to say to much about the other ones, but they were all great and I loved them all. There is something wrong in the Archive and it's someone in the inside that does bad things and I suspected someone the whole time but in the end I was wrong and I like that. It wasn't predictable. God I'm really jumping from one thing to another here.I'll sum it all up by just saying that it's really good, I'm going to buy the hardback copy of it next month because it's just that great (and duhh, cover love!) and I can't wait to read the sequel. I'd recommend this book to people who loved Anna Dressed in Blood or even the TV-show Supernatural (first season). It's really original and definitely a must-read for fans of the YA Paranormal genre.

{"reviewText": "Wow... This book is heartbreaking, frustrating, dramatic, romantic and more. It was more then I expected, to be honest. Way more. And I loved every part of it.So in this book suicide is an epidemic. And the only 'cure' they could come up with is The Program. (Stupid donkeys... I may have a few ideas that could help you know. For instance... Stop the monkeys that are making those super kill pills or let people mourn when they've lost someone... Don't wipe their memory if they get depressed because it's actually your fault they are because they can't show their emotions the way they should... Okay, I'm stopping now. Moving on.) So you get it. The Program basically erases your memories. Takes the bad ones that make you 'sick' away. So if you show signs of being sick, they take you to one of the facilities and wipe your memory and then in the end you're happy again and all the bad stuff is gone. (I would rather take one of those kill pills instead of getting my memory wiped.) It's actually pretty original. But seriously. So many geniuses in the world and that's the best they could come up with? Tsss.So the main character in this story is Sloane. She is a really fun character and I loved her. I felt for her and I felt a lot. No kidding. The first part of the book is heartbreaking (the whole book is actually but okay). Her brother died, her best friend doesn't remember her, her other best friend dies and the boy she loves is taken from her too. Yeesh, talk about a hard life. But she is a fighter and she wants to hold on to James as long as she can. She doesn't want to forget. I love her for that. She's strong.The second half of the story is equally heartbreaking and a bit frustrating near the end. If you lose your memories, can you get them back? Does your heart remember what your mind forgot? That's the main question in the second half of the story. And it was so frustrating to know what she did not anymore. But I am sooo glad the way this book ended. And I can't wait for the next book.Oh and I love James. He's awesome and hot. And Realm is ...

{"reviewText": "Actual Rating: 3,5 starsSing and the darkness will find you.With a sentence like that on the cover I was totally prepared to read an awesome book with some cool action and a kick-ass heroine. But... I expected to much because, although I liked it quite a bit, I still feel like it let me down. And I would've liked to know that the story takes place a few centuries ago. Between 1667 and 1669. Maybe that sounds stupid, but I like that kind of information beforehand. Not that it matters a lot in what time the story takes place, it's just a detail that's important to me.First of all, I liked the characters in this story. Lucy and every other character in it matter. How small their part may be, they're all important and I like that. So many books have characters that don't really help the story and are unnecessary, this one didn't. So that's a good thing. I wanted to see a little more from the villain though... We meet him once in the entire book and I can't even remember his name right now... He didn't really leave a big impression on me. The Shadowgrims are cool but they also don't play a big role yet. Maybe we'll get to see more of the bad guys in the sequel? Let's hope so!The story is well thought out. I do believe the author really took some time to work it all out, so that is good. But although it's interesting and quite original, is so slow. I would've liked to see more action, instead most of the book lucy is underground, hiding and training. Love the character developement we get from that, but it gets boring after a couple of hundred pages. I wanted more action! What I do like about that is the romance. It builds nice and slow. it's more realistic and it's not a big part of the story yet. But I think it will be in the books that follow. They probably shouldn't have called it romantic in the blurb, because it isn't that romantic yet.So this is a pretty good book and fans of the genre might like it. If you want a nice relaxing read, I recommend it as well. If you love books that move to the action quick, I wouldn't recommend it because this isn't one of those book. I really hope we get more action in the next book. The cover is awesome though .", "overall": 3.0}

With so much pressure building, all she wants is to escape and when Simone, her best friend, offers to take her to a party on that fateful Friday night, she ends up at a crossroads . Will she stay with her grandma? Or go to the party with Simone? Her decision splits her fate into two different paths and she's about to live them both. But which one is the right one?Oh my god, this boo is just... Epic. It's so damn relatable too. It's insane. The writing is great, I felt so much reading this book. Probably because a lot of people can relate to this. The story has three parts. Before, Stay and Go. First we have Before and after that you have one chapter Stay, the next Go and after that again Stay and so on. I liked the perspective that gave me. We saw how each of the two choices affected her life and family and friends and even love-life. Yeah, maybe it was a bit predictable, but honestly? I don't care. It was just a beautiful, amazing story and it ended just as I hoped it would and that's all that really matters in the end for me.I really liked the characters. Caroline is very easy to relate to. I mean, I know how she felt most of the time because I've been there. I understood it. I loved Simone and Natalie and Teddy and Chris and maybe even Joel. And I loved how everything blended together in the end. So beautiful!Amazing book with more depth to it than I expected at first and written so beautifully. I absolutely recommend this book to everyone who ever lost a loved one and everyone who is fortunate enough to have never gone through that pain.Warning! This book can and probably will make you cry.

{"reviewText": "Honestly, this is not a genre I usually read. No, correction. This is not a genre I usually enjoy. But I did! I enjoyed this book! Surprisingly so.So, in this book the earth is dying. It's overrun and destroyed by humanity. The 'world government' has terraformed a new planet and is slowly bringing people to that planet. It has several POV's, both on earth and Exilon 5 (the new planet). And each character mattered and had their own voice!We have Bill, a high level government official who doesn't like the natives from the new planet (called Indigene) very much because he thinks they killed his wife. It follows a few natives and a few characters back on earth. The different POV's made it easier for me to get into the story, which is usually very hard for me in this genre. BUT, sometimes it felt like there were to many. Some were necessary, I get that, but some were not and I wouldn't have minded if those didn't have a separate POV.But the story was very fascinating and really original. It's a very good example of the issues that follow when a government has ultimate control over people. And I liked discovering the origins and background from the Indigenes. Very interesting to read. And it never got really predictable. Some parts were, but most of the time it surprised me.It's obvious this is the first part from a trilogy. This book covers most of the world-building and backstory (which is a huge plus) and introduces the characters to us. While doing all that, it makes me curious for the sequel. Very well done Eliza!If you love Sci Fi books or dystopian, you will like (or even love) this one too. I recommend it to them.

{"reviewText": "Wow. This story was... Yeesh... It was great! It was romantic, dramatic, and hot. Yeah, seriously hot.In this book we meet Erin at a very hard time in her life. The first chapter, the prologue gave me tears in my eyes already. And then suddenly we're a few years later and Erin has promised herself not to love again in order not to get hurt again. Makes sense, right? I thought so. Love can be a bitch. But she didn't expect to meet Alek, who turns her world upside down and tries to break down the wall she build around herself.The story started out good, as I already said. But the first two chapters after the prologue didn't really get my attention and I was easily distracted from the book. That changed when I started chapter 3 and the story began to get more and more interesting every page I turned. The double POV really helped in that. It made the story better and it got to me more and more every chapter.The relationship isn't rushed and that is a very good thing. It's not an instant love kinda thing. It builds and grows as the story goes along and I loved that. When I was about 70% into the story, I got a feeling what was going to happen and I didn't want to be right, but I was and I was crying and sobbing and then the end came and I was crying happy tears. So it's an understatement when I say this book is an emotional roller coaster.I really liked Erin. She had a tough time when she was young and that made her shy away from anything new and avoids love at all cost because she doesn't want to get hurt. So when she meets Alek, she kind of tries to avoid him because he is a huge new thing. (A delicious and handsome one at that.) She doesn't want that in her perfectly organised life. But she opens up to him and grows. And I loved her in the end. Alek was... omg Alek. He's yummy. He has issues and a past but he also grows and opens up to Erin. They help each other and learn each other how to love again and that was one of the best things in this book in my opinion.I hated Lila, by the way. God what a *beeeeep*.So Kas, I really really REALLY loved your book and I hope I get more of Erin and Alek in the future? Or anything else from you in this genre is fine too.This review will also be on Goodreads, my blog and Barnes & Noble .", "overall": 4.0}
{"reviewText": "Surah and Charlie are the main characters here and they live in the world from The Alexa Montgomery Saga (which I really recommend by the way) and their story is set after the events from those books. That is just one thing that makes this book awesome. My expectations were really high for this one. H.D. did an amazing job on Alexa's story and I didn't think she could live up to that. I hoped for it, but I didn't think she would. And she didn't let me down. This book is beyond awesome.At first, Surah reminded me of Jasmine (you know, from Aladdin). She was a princess that didn't want to be a princess anymore with a huge tiger as a pet and best friend and she falls in love with a common boy. So I guess Charlie is kind of like Aladdin too. But Jasmine didn't have lavender hair and eyes and cool magic powers and she wasn't hundreds of years old. Surah is one kickass heroine. She can kick some as but at the same time, she struggles with the doubts within herself. Will she be what her father expects her to be? Or will she go her own way?Charlie was so cute and sweet! He has been in love with Surah for years. (Centuries actually.) He even wrote a song for her! Gosh, I want my own Charlie. *swoon*Do I even have to tell you how awesome Samson is? No. You know he is, even if you haven't read the book yet.I don't like Michael, he's an ass and for some reason I don't like Theo either. I just have a bad feeling about that guy.This story doesn't have a slow start. H.D.'s books never really have. She doesn't wait to start the action, she just does it. I love her so much. She is such an incredible writer and an amazing storyteller. She has a way with words that I can't describe. Every time I finish a book, I just sit in my chair for a moment. Speechless.On of the best things of this book? The romance. There is no insta-love here! Not at all. Charlie and Surah have been in love with each other for centuries (even though they have a hard time admitting that). I wouldn't exactly call that insta-love, would you? They are so sweet together and when Charlie sang that song to Surah, the hopeless romantic in me rejoiced.So long story short, this book is great. The world, the characters, the story. It is everything I wanted and more. Much more. Thank you H.D. for yet another amazing book. And hurry up on the sequel, please .", "overall": 5.0}
{"reviewText": "Jep, 3 stars. That's right. That's a pretty high rating for an angel book coming from me. But then again, this is not an ordinary angel book. And still I missed something in it. I think I, as always, expected more.So this is the story of Rosa. She is a hunter, a pretty good one actually. I liked her. She was a cool main character. I liked Jason and I liked the two of them together. Now, I don't exactly know what I missed in this book... Maybe I wanted a little more action? Maybe it's the end that disappointed me? I don't know. I only know that there was something missing in this book. The writing was okay. Pretty good, but not great either. The book overall was pretty average. Maybe it just isn't my thing. If you're a fan of angel books, you'll most likely like this book too. If not, you might not like this one, but then again, this is just my opinion .", "overall": 3.0}
{"reviewText": "2.5 starsWell... I'm sad to say this but I'm so happy I finished this book because I didn't think I'd make it through it. I didn't like it that much. There were some good elements, but for the most part I was frustrated, annoyed and bored. And I'll explain why.This book is about Hailey. Hailey has been famous and in the spotlight for as long as she can remember. But she's getting tired off all that. So she's going to college. Start over. But that's easier said than done. Classes are harder than she thought they'd be and her mother is determined to ruin her life because of her choice to leave Hollywood. And there's Caleb Fox, the guy she never expected. He doesn't want her for her fame, he just wants her. And Hailey isn't sure if she can give him what he wants. And what if he finds out the one secret the tabloids don't know yet? Will he still be there?First the bad things. Get it over with.1) I didn't like the writing that much. It was pretty simple and there were a lot of cliche things in the story. And some of the things the characters said were just... No. Just no. I can compare it to the writing in Fifty Shades. Not exactly the best I've ever seen.2) Hailey was SO annoying! Most of the time I was thinking: `Why do you have to be that way? Seriously! Why???' Whenever someone wants to be friends with her, she immediately thinks they want that because they're famous. Yeesh. And when she walks into a room at school she's like: `Oh hey nobody stops and stares. That's weird.' Again... No. Just no. On top of that, in the blurb they mention some secret and I thought it would be something big that would make the story a whole lot better but when I read what it was... I was banging my head against the table. Such a stupid stupid thing. Why would anybody hate you for that? It's not like you're the only one in the world to have done that. Seriously. NO. That's all I'm going to say about her for now.3) The insta-love. Well not really love but they do have an instant attraction to each other and even before talking to each other, they NEED to have the other person. They just NEED to kiss and all that. Yeah... Also a no for me.Now the good.1) I actually liked Caleb. He was a sweet guy and cares for Hailey (even though I wouldn't understand why...) And I liked most of the other characters too. Griff may be my soulmate.2) The story itself wasn't that bad. If the writing had been better, I probably would have liked the book a lot more. And Hailey too.Okay that's it for this review. I'm sorry I didn't like it, but hey that's the way it is sometimes .", "overall": 2.0}
{"reviewText": "3.5 stars!Okay, I liked this story! I didn't really love it, but I liked it! And The Devil's Tattoo has got to be the coolest bandname ever. Seriously.Zoe Granger started playing guitar ever her heart was broken into a million pieces. And music has been her escape ever since. Then her best friend Dee suggest they start a band and everything goes quick after that. They call themselves The Devil's Tattoo and after releasing their first EP, it's on top of the sharts in no time. Contracts, photo shoots, interviews,... Everything has changed in such a short amount of time. Then they're asked to tour with the hot indie band The Stabs. Will is the bass player of that band and he only has eyes for Zoe, but Zoe doesn't trust guys that easy and she doesn't want her heart broken again. But Will is determined. This tour is either going to be a highway to hell or a stairway to heaven.I liked the story. It's really cool! I love music and this is pretty realistic. Things can go very quick very sudden and I liked that! The writing was good too, although it was a bit fast in the beginning and I didn't quite understand the situation between Will and Zoe because of that. It seemed like insta-love, but it wasn't. It just seemed that way because of the fact that we skip through a couple of months in the first few chapters. But it got better once they started the tour and even though I liked those two together, I kind of wanted Zoe to fall for her best friend because they were so funny together! Their conversations are hilarious and they seem like a married couple after 30 years of marriage. Seriously cool. The whole band is that way. It's like a family and I love that!I liked the characters. Zoe is cool and I get where she comes from. And I adore Dee, he's just awesome. I really liked all of them and I'm happy that I got to know them!If you love books about bands and music and friendship and all that, you'll probably like this one too. So try it out! Maybe it's something for you .", "overall": 3.0}
{"reviewText": "What's up with the dystopian novels these days? Almost every single one I've read in the last month were great. I've read some bad ones in the past and lost hope a little for the genre, but David Estes' The Moon Dwellers gave me hope again and since then, my hope grew and I can now officially say that I love this genre once again. And this book was no different. I really liked it!Two Thirds of the world's population is wiped out after the worst war ever seen on the planet Earth. One of the survivors is Charlotte, a girl that can read minds. After losing her family, the New World leader takes her with him and soon she becomes his secret weapon. Her job is to make sure the rebels stay down, where they belong. Until one of them sneaks past her defences and makes her feel things she never felt before. But will this love save them or end them?I don't know why I've read anything by Janelle before. I mean... I wanted too, but never got it. I even won a copy of Eden in a giveaway a few weeks ago. I just didn't get to it I guess. But I will soon, because I love her! She's a great writer and I love her style. I'm normally not a big fan of writing in first person, but I didn't really mind in this book. But it is one of two the things that kept this book from being 5 stars. The second one being the fact that the double POV was a bit confusing in the beginning. I was really invested in the first one, Charlotte's, and then it switches to another person. And it's because of that first person writing, that it was so confusing. But that's really the only bad thing I can say about this book. I love the way Janelle created the world the story takes place in and I just love Janelle. Next to talented, she's also a very sweet and nice woman.I like the characters too. Charlotte is pretty badass. I'm sure she can kick some ass if she needs to. Yeah, she's beautiful, but they don't really use that as a weapon. She has to wear a mask to keep the fact that she's a girl a secret, so that's another thing I liked. She grows a lot in this book and even though she is a badass heroine, she's still vulnerable. That makes her human and relatable.I liked Pete too and Ramon and Ludwig and all the other characters, but Charlotte's my favorite, so.I am going to read the sequel when it's out and I definitely recommend it to everyone who loves dystopian novels .", "overall": 4.0}
{"reviewText": "3.5 stars!To be clear, I enjoyed this book. It was pretty good and the characters were awesome, but at times it was a bit... boring. I think some people will compare it to twilight, and it is similar, like so many books are, but this book at least has fun and entertaining Main Characters. And the writing is good. I just would've liked to see more action, more... something. Maybe in the second book?Sunshine is about Sophie. She has an allergy for the sun which means she's almost as pale as Caspar, Snow White or a vampire. At least, that's what the kids at school say. But she doesn't really care anymore. She has two amazing best friends and she can always count on her family. Well most of them anyway. And then Myles comes along. It's clear from the start that something's up with him. He has secrets, but so does Sophie. Both of them have a past they do not wish to share. But as they grow closer, more and more secrets will be revealed.So this story is good and well... Like I said, it was a bit boring. For the most part of the story, nothing really happens. Myles and Sophie get to know each other and their friendship grows and blossoms into something more eventually, but nothing exciting really happens until we hit the 80% mark. If the characters weren't as fun and cool as they were, I wouldn't have given this book the rating I just gave. But it's nice to see a friendship grow into something more between two people. Especially a human and vampire. Yeah, no surprise there. Most of the book is told in the blurb, which made it a bit predictable. Oh and by the way, not to sound like a total geek, but in the above quote... Charmander first evolves into Charmeleon and then Charizard. (Okay yeah, I'm a geek.)I think it's clear that I loved the characters. Sophie is pretty cool. She has a milky white skin, dark magenta hair and wears combat boots. Seriously. Awesome. And yeah, she has issues to deal with from the past, but I get it. There is a depth to her and I liked that. And I loved seeing her growing and learning to care of someone other then her two awesome best friends. Talking about best friends. In this case we have a Korean brother and sister, Boo and Trei (as in peek-a-book and tree). They are soooo cool and funny. And there are some other well-developed side-characters like the stepdad and sisters and high-school barbie bitches. But I hated Sophie's mom. Not exactly mother-of-the-year material. But I really loved Myles! He's a cool vampire and he cares for her. I like the vampires in this book by the way. They're cool.So overall I liked this book. And the ending pretty much made up for the boring parts in the rest of the book. So I'm excited to read the next book sometime in the future! And I do recommend this book to people who love the genre and want to see a relationship that grows for a change. No insta-love in this book! Hurray! But okay. So check this book out people .", "overall": 3.0}
{"reviewText": "Wow. I really hoped I would like this book because it's just in my wheel house with the elemental stuff. But you know what? I didn't like this book. Not at all. I F-ing LOVED it! YES you read that right. I just gave 5 stars to a dystopian novel. And everyone who knows me knows that that is pretty rare. Just as rare as someone calling 50 Shades a literary masterpiece.So this is your basic dystopian world (not really). The world is in ruins after a lot of shit has happened and now people live in domes all across the world. It's only safe in those domes and even there life is hard. Avery lives in Dome Four. She's one of the Elementalists, one of the best. She generates steam for the dome. Without steam, no oxygen, no electricity, nothing. But Avery feels more like a pawn than an Elite. And when a man called Riggs offers her a way out, offers her freedom, it's hard to resist. But even there, nothing is what it seems. Even there where she's supposed to be free, are lies.I loved the story. Next to the obvious reason with the elements, it's just a good dystopian book. The writing was really good. I can't really describe it, it just was so fun and nice reading this book. Megan Curd has a very good style of writing. Everything plays like a movie in my head and I love that. The worldbuilding is great. It's not so much you get bored, but not so little you don't understand a thing either. It's just enough and it's great. I got sucked into this story right away. And I just loooove when that happens.Now I've got to talk about some of the characters. Not all of them because of spoilers, but some of them. First off, Avery. Man I love her. She's got some serious spunk. Talk about a kick-ass main character. She's awesome. I loved Alice too. She may seem like a shy and quiet girl, but she's not. She's cool and I like her. Sari too, she's cool. Also pretty kick-ass. And Legs. He's funny and I love him too. And Jaxon. My god. I have a new book boyfriend. Damn.I can't talk about any of the other characters because I would spoil the whole book if I did. And I don't roll that way.Would I read this book again? Hells yeah. Will I read the sequels? Hells yeah. Would I recommend it to anyone? You betcha.This book is perfect for fans of the dystopian genre. Even fans of fantasy will like/love this book. If you're a fan of books with elemental stuff like me, you'll really love this book. So read it. Like... now .", "overall": 5.0}
{"reviewText": "Seriously Dara, you never disappoint me. Every book of you I read, is awesome. That's the reason I agreed to beta this new series for you. I knew it would be great and I knew I would love it. That's why I said I would make room in my schedule for you anytime. Because you are an amazingly talented writer and I love you!So this story is about Kat, a were-leopard (really, those exist? Never heard of it before, but it's cool!) who grew up with a pack of werewolves. She has a secret relationship with the soon-to-be Alpha male of the pack, Jason. And he's the reason she has to leave. Because he can't claim her as his. Because of who she is, she can't be Alpha female. So she leaves everything behind.Seven years go by and she's build a new life with a normal human called Marc. But it doesn't last long. She meets other were-leopards and soon she finds herself in a whole lot of trouble. So she has to go back to her pack, because that's the only place she can be safe. That also means she has to see Jason again. And of course, trouble follows her as does passion, lust, love and more trouble.As I said already, the writing is great and I didn't expect less from Dara. I know she's very talented. She just has a way of making everything become more realistic. Not many authors can do that. Especially in this genre. I mean, paranormal romance with very specific erotic scenes? It's kind of hard to make it realistic. Especially when it's about were-leopards and werewolves. I loved the story too. It's original and really, really hot! And the romance is good too. Although I'm a bit split about which one I like the most. So you have Kat and Jason to begin with. They have a history and I get that. They grew up together and fell in love, so it's certainly the most believable. And it's not insta-love. And Kat does love him a lot, that is until James comes in her life. But first Marc. He is a human and they were together when she wasn't with the pack. He disappeared and I don't know what happened to him, but I hope I'll find out in the next book. She forgets him kind of quickly. And yes, James. They are the same in many ways and it's only normal they're attracted to each other and all that. But still... Kat was kind of quick with moving on from Jason and Marc and falling for James.I liked Kat, she's a cool character, but I did find her a bit annoying. You know, she's a real cat in heat and she jumps from one guy to the next (not literally) fairly quick and that annoyed me. She loved Jason first then she left. She loved Marc and ran back to the pack for her safety right into the arms of Jason once again and then stuff happens and there's James. So. But I liked her, she's got spunk and she's pretty stubborn, so that's cool. And I liked James too. Didn't see Marc that much, so I don't know about him yet. But Jason... I liked him, but I didn't get to know how that good. So I hope I get to know him better in the next book. And all the other characters are cool too.Thanks to Dara, for letting me beta-read this book. I'm starting the next book tomorrow! I recommend this to fans of the genre or people who love erotic romance novels with a paranormal twist. D.T. Dyllin is an awesome writer and I will read anything she writes because I know it will be good. So, D. Whenever you got new stuff to beta, don't ask, just send it to me okay .", "overall": 5.0}
{"reviewText": "My first thought after finishing this book was: `Wow, this is a comic in book form.' And that's not a bad thing. Absolutely not. I love comics with superheroes and all that stuff. And I read this pretty quick. Got through it in less than 3 hours.This book is about Jim, a teenage boy with super powers. He moonlights as a Super Bounty Hunter under the name Mohawk and he's also known as Kid Sensation. He got into the trials of the Academy, a place where all teen with powers go to see if they can become a superhero. And because of some super ass he didn't get a chance to enter even though he was qualified.I enjoyed this book because I love all things superhero (Marvel, DC Comics, ... that sort of stuff. And elements. Let' s not forget those). Yeah, I'm a geek. But it was not really that special for me. It had a few flaws, which brought the book down a lot. It was a bit confusing with the flashbacks too. The writing was okay but there were some typos. I didn't have to think that much while reading and sometimes that's not a bad thing. But when there was a flashback, that changed and I was confused because I didn't immediately got the fact that it's a flashback. I do like the cover, it gives the book the whole comic book vibe I got when I finished it.I liked the characters, but there were cliches. I don't mind a few, but in this book, there were quite a lot of them. Overall this is a good book to read when I'm lazy and just want to put my mind off things and have a good time.

My head hurts trying to figure that one out. xDSo this is a good book and I liked it. But it wasn't more then that for me. Good, but not great. That's why I gave it 3.5 stars. Good job A.D.!

{"reviewText": "I really liked this book. I really did. It was original and I loved the mystery and the riddle Matty has to solve and I loved discovering it with him. This was a pretty good book.So this is the story of Matty. He's really smart. Seriously. I had a headache when he was talking or thinking smart things. Wendy did her research on that department. I liked the world she created and the references to this time. You know, the months, Yesa (I see what you did there Wendy, smart, really smart, lol.), That was really cool. So this smart guy doesn't like the school he goes to because the teachers are actually less smart then he is and he is bored all the time. So the King offers him a master's diploma but first he has to answer the question: What was January Black? It's a ship, but that's not the answer the King wants. So Matty has to figure out what January Black really was and I loved that we learned everything together with him. It kept me guessing and it was so fascinating. This was a really fascinating book.I loved Matty. Like I said, he gave me a headache every now and then, but I liked him. For some reason I kept hearing his voice in a British accent. Don't know why. I loved Iris and they were very cute together. It didn't feel forced and it was nice to see them grow as a couple. To see them fall in love with each other. I didn't know whether or not to like King Hadrian. Some times I did, then I didn't. Same with his dad. But I loved his mother.I don't exactly know what genre this is exactly. YA fantasy I think. So if you love that genre, you should read this book. If you don't, but you like books with mystery and smart guys that gives you a headache and sound British in your head, then you should read it too. I actually recommend it. The British accent thing. It's kind of sexy .", "overall": 4.0}

{"reviewText": "1.5 starsIf you've been reading my reviews for a while now, you know angel books can be a hit or a miss for me. This was not a hit, unfortunately. Though the blurb and the cover make it look and sound like a great book, it wasn't for me. Not at all.I'm not going to waste anytime giving a short summary of the book. This book was so frustrating and those were the longest 200 pages ever. It didn't seem to end and while that is a good thing with some books, it wasn't for this one. I couldn't wait for it to end. The writing was... not good. Not even okay. This book needs a good editor. Some things just sounded ridiculous. And I didn't feel anything throughout the book. Part of that was probably because of the characters, which I'll explain in a minute. The book was a bit boring too. Nothing really happened until the second half of the book and by then it already lost my interest. Some of the action scenes weren't that bad, but still. It took a whole lot more to make me love the book. Or even like it.The events in this book take place over just a few days and despite that the romance in this book is insta-love. Sigh. I'm starting to hate it. With a passion. Seriously. Especially in this book. Again, the characters. Okay, let's just get straight to it.I was never so frustrated by characters before. Not even Bella from Twilight. I'm serious. Even though her name is Emma Wise, she certainly isn't wise or smart. And no depth at all. The book starts out when they're bringing her in the hospital after a horrible car crash in which her parents died. It's a miracle she even survived. The next day, they tell her she's moving to Alaska the next day to some aunt. You'd think that she'd mourn the loss of her parents, but noooo. She's angry because she has to leave her friends and stuff behind. And the next day, Kade comes to pick her up. She's instantly in love with him. Again, her parents just died two days ago and she thinks about the boy and how hot he is? -Sigh- Then they leave for alaska and on the plane Kade tells her she'll be homeschooled and that makes her angry again because that's not fair and she can't spend her senior year being homeschooled. And blah blah blah. No emotions. At all.Then there are the best friends. One of the things her friend asks is: What happened to your cell? At that point, I was screaming to my e-reader. Your best friend just miraculously survived a deadly car crash. What the hell do you think happened to her cell phone? Ugh.Is it normal in the US that people who miraculously survived a deadly car crash can leave the hospital and go on a plane the next day? I don't know that but it sounds pretty stupid.There have never been so much caps in my notes before. So yeah, I was frustrated a lot reading this book and I am so so SO happy I finished it because I never thought I would. So I'm sorry, but I can't say that I recommend this book to anyone. I guess if you love angel books, you might as well give it a try because I want to know if there is anyone who shares my opinion. Sigh .", "overall": 1.0}

It flowed nicely from one book to the next and that's very awesome in a book. I hate it when it just jumps from one thing to another and this book didn't do that.The writing was good, although sometimes a bit simplistic than I'm used to in this genre, but that's okay. There's great character developement, they all grow throughout the series and that's awesome. The magic in this book was really cool and the world building was very well done. The romance in this book was sweet and emotional and it really fit into the story without taking it over to much.If you're a fan of this genre, I really recommend these books.

{"reviewText": "3.5 starsI'm surprised to say that I really liked this book! It was a pretty cool and original concept and it worked out well. I found a few typos, but they didn't bother me that much. Kimberly gives her own spin on mermaids and sirens and mixed that with some cool action, fantastic underwater scenes and a passionate romance.Waterborn is about Caris. She just moved to a little town near the sea from Kentucky with her dad and she can't help but feel different here. Like the sea is calling her. And then she meets Noah, not knowing what he is. Noah is a waterbreather and he hears Caris' song in his head and he can't help but feel attracted to her. Soon enough, Caris finds out what and who she is. But is that really who she wants to be?The writing in this book was very good. I couldn't put this book down once I picked it up. I was pulled into Caris' world and wanted to find the answers to her questions just as much as she did. The story was cool and I got just the right amount of action and in the end my questions were answered. The romance was so sweet and passionate at the same time, I couldn't get enough of it.But despite the fact that there was some action, I never felt like it was enough. I kept waiting for something big, but it never really happened. And that took a bit from the story for me. I wanted more.I really liked Caris, she was a cool main character, but sometimes she annoyed me quite a bit. I can't even tell you why because I don't know. Maybe the way she acted around Noah in the beginning? And I liked Noah, he was sweet and he had some issues to deal with. And I got that. And it wasn't really insta-love between him and Caris because of the whole siren-song thing. I didn't like Sol and Pax, obviously. I loved Maggie and Erin and Caris' dad. I'm a bit conflicted about Athen, though. I'm not sure if I should like him or hate him.Overall, this is a good mermaid-ish story. Kimberly gave her own spin on it all and that was pretty cool but I finished the book wanting more. So yes, I have yet to find a book in this genre that completely blows my socks off. But I do recommend it, maybe you like it more than I did .", "overall": 3.0}
{"reviewText": "Well, Heather... You've done it again. This was one hell of a book. Mind-blowing, all-consuming, can't-look-away-even-if-I-tried, breathtaking, heart-pounding,... Words just aren't enough to describe what I think of this book. It was all that and more. Especially the romance. Well... I expected it actually. Having read all but one of H.D. Gordon's books, I knew it would be awesome. And it sure was. Damn.Falling Stars starts right where Shooting Stars left off. Now I can't tell too much about it because of spoilers, so I'll just say that Surah and Charlie are in for a breathtaking romance and a whole lot of trouble. This series is starting to prove itself to be just as epic as the Alexa Montgomery Saga was.Just as in all the other books, the writing was awesome. Heather has a way of pulling me into a story and never letting me go. Not even for a second. I was right there with Surah and Charlie and even Samson. I felt like I was a part of their journey. And what a journey it was. Just the right amount of action and the romance... I'll say it again... Damn. My heart stopped several times over the course of this book only to pound a hundred times faster when it started back up again. And it literally made me gasp at some points. Not just the romance, but the whole book. I love how I'm pulled into each and every book Heather wrote and feel so many things. And I loved the fact that we got some chapters from Samson's Point of view. He is without a doubt the most awesome pet animal.I think it's safe to say that Surah is one of the most awesome characters ever. She's no spoiled princess that needs a knight in shining armor to help her when she's in trouble. Surah can handle herself, and how. She can seriously kick some ass. And I love for that. The most awesome princess ever. (With the most awesome pet ever.) And Charlie... Charlie. I can't think of him without getting a big fat smile on my face and a deep sigh. Though he, too, can kick serious ass, he's also very sweet and caring and just... perfect in my eyes. I love him. And it's pretty obvious I love Samson too. But I hate Michael and actually... I hate Theo too. Just don't like him.One last thing before I end this review... What is up with that ending Heather? Seriously??? Are you kidding me? I'm sure somewhere in the world this is a form of torture. Just... Just give me the next book okay? Like... Yesterday.Fans of H.D. Gordon will love this book. And people who haven't read anything from her yet... Well I suggest you better get started. Read the Alexa Montgomery Saga first. It's not necessary but you'll understand some things in these series better when you do. If you love fantasy and an amazing romance, I highly recommend Heather's books .", "overall": 5.0}
{"reviewText": "2.5 starsAlthough this book started strong and had an emotional moment towards to end, most of the time I was just bored. Most books in this genre are basically the same, but it&#8217;s the way it&#8217;s executed that matters. And I&#8217;m really sorry that I have to say this, but this one was just not that good for me personally.Ember&#8217;s world comes crashing down on her when she learns her father has died in Afghanistan. Her mother becomes a zombie and she&#8217;s the one that has to keep everything together. And than her jerk of a boyfriend, Riley becomes the most hated person for me in this book and the only one Ember can find comfort in is Josh. It&#8217;s a pretty standard story, but it felt so long and I was so bored through most of it. The beginning was so good. The first few chapters had me in tears, but when Josh came along, I lost that connection. In the end is a moment that was very emotional and I had tears in my eyes from it, but for the rest I just didn&#8217;t care. And I think the problem for me is with the characters.Ember is not a great character, but she&#8217;s okay. She has to take care of her brother and sister and mom after her father&#8217;s dead. And she&#8217;s okay. But her mom. In the first half of the book she&#8217;s practically a zombie. She does nothing but sleep and she doesn&#8217;t care anymore. I get it, she&#8217;s sad and I&#8217;ve been there, but she has responsibilities! She has kids to take care of! Ember shouldn&#8217;t have to change her whole life just because her mom doesn&#8217;t want to do anything anymore! And Ember&#8217;s grandmother comes to help, but she doesn&#8217;t do much either. April is&#8230; I don&#8217;t know. Just okay I guess. She goes off the rails for a bit but that&#8217;s it. Her little brother Gus is the one I cared about the most. In the beginning of the book, the first chapter, Ember has to tell him their father died. This is a bit from that moment.&#8220;Daddy isn&#8217;t coming home, Gus.&#8221;Little blue eyes filled with tears, and his lower lip began to quiver. &#8220;Did the bad guys get him?&#8221;It broke my heart! I felt so sad for that little guy! But he was the only one I really felt something for. Josh was also okay. He&#8217;s exactly what I expected him to be. He&#8217;s Gus&#8217; hockey coach and he and Ember went to the same school for a while years ago. The romance between him and Ember is just&#8230; weird. It started weird and I didn&#8217;t feel a connection to them so I think that&#8217;s why the book was so boring to me. And then you have Riley and Kayla. Ember&#8217;s boyfriend and best friend. They&#8217;re stupid. He&#8217;s an ass and a dick. And he&#8217;s pathetic. And Kayla&#8217;s a bitch. Why? Well, it&#8217;s not really a spoiler because it happens in the beginning, but I&#8217;ll hide it anyway. -SPOILER- Riley doesn&#8217;t show up at the funeral and a weeks after it he has a party and Ember goes to surprise him, (Josh was so kind to give her a ride) and there she finds him sleeping with Kayla. Like actual sex. And she finds out they&#8217;ve been doing it for a year. The worst thing about it, is that Ember and Riley had been together for three years and they had their whole life planned out. And Riley wanted to wait until they were married before they had sex. She didn&#8217;t want to, he did. And he has the words excuses for it. And he comes begging for her forgiveness throughout most of the book and I just wanted to hit him so hard. And the night she finds all that out, is also the night she just starts everything with Josh. Which is why it&#8217;s weird. Her dad just died, she just broke up with her cheating boyfriend after three years and then she immediately wants to have sex with him. That&#8217;s just weird. -END SPOILER-In the end it just didn&#8217;t do it for me. I was bored most of the time and except for a few emotional moments involving Ember&#8217;s dad, I didn&#8217;t really feel anything. I would recommend it to fans of the genre. Maybe you&#8217;ll love it! I hope you do! So give it a shot .", "overall": 2.0}
{"reviewText": "4.5 stars!I&#8217;ve been waiting and wanting to read this one for months now and when Stephanie said it was ready for beta-reading, I was so happy! Even though it&#8217;s long, like a proper fantasy novel usually is, I really really loved it. So take a deep breath Steph, nothing to fear in this review.The Lost Kingdom takes place in Ilendia and it&#8217;s about Arima, a sixteen year old girl whose world is turned upside down when she finds out she&#8217;s Lady Spirit, one of the five Ladies of Elements. According to a centuries old Prophecy, she has to unite all the five Ladies and save Ilendia and the Other Lands from Ahriman, the Demon King. Even though Arima has no choice but accept the destiny she never even wanted and go on a journey into the unknown.The Lost Kingdom was originally published in Dutch and Stephanie wanted to take it to the next level and started translating it herself so more people were able to read it and yes, she&#8217;s going indie! She has been working very hard on this for months now and I&#8217;ve been helping wherever I can. I&#8217;m sort of a PR person for her, a beta reader,&#8230; But above all, her best friend. And honestly, I was terrified I wouldn&#8217;t like it that much because it would break my heart if I had to write a negative review. Luckily, I loved it!This has everything a good YA Fantasy book needs. A cool, brilliant world? Check! A strong, pretty bad ass heroine? Check! A scary, evil villain? Check! Mystery, Magic and more of that good stuff? Check, check and check! Plus I did get a lot of feels from it too! Especially in the beginning and at the end. And elemental magic powers!! That&#8217;s the thing I loved the most because I love it when a book has that. The world Stephanie created was amazing and in the Dutch copy there is a map, but the one that made it left out some of the most important cities so it&#8217;s not very helpful. I don&#8217;t know if there will be a map in the English book too, but if not, you&#8217;ll have to use your imagination. And Stephanie does a good job at helping you with that. The whole land/world was in my head!Of course, with Fantasy sometimes comes strange words. And there are some in this one too. Creatures I didn&#8217;t know because they were made up, a language that was also made up. There is a legend at the end with all the meanings of those words and names, but I think I pronounce them very, very wrong in my head so. That&#8217;s a bit confusing, but I got used to it. And most Fantasy books I know (like the ones from James Clemens, Robin Hobb, Terry Goodkind,&#8230;) are very long and this one is too in my opinion. It has 332 pages in the beta stage and before you say that that&#8217;s not long at all, it is because these are normal pages in the PDF format. So if she would print it out, that&#8217;s how many standard sized pages there would be. So it&#8217;s long, but that&#8217;s not a bad thing because Stephanie really takes her time to develop this story and its characters. Yeah it can get a little, tiny bit boring. BUT, there&#8217;s a but! Just when you&#8217;re starting to feel like putting the book down, something happens that hooks you again and you&#8217;re back on track!I really loved Arima. She really grows a lot in this book and I like that. She doesn&#8217;t want to be Lady Spirit at first and denies everything. But then something happens and she&#8217;s forced to flee from her village and she has to grow up pretty quick and learn more about these new powers she has. And she can really kick some ass if she needs too. The battle at the end is pretty epic. It&#8217;s not very long, but the book is, so appreciated the fact that Stephanie didn&#8217;t drag the battle out just to make it longer. And on her journey she meets several fun characters. Blythe, Myrddin, Laguun, &#8230; And of course her unicorn, Sirrim. No it&#8217;s not as lame as it sounds, the unicorn is also pretty bad ass.So if you&#8217;re looking for an awesome YA Fantasy book in the style of James Clemens, Terry Goodkind (and more), this is a good choice! I really loved it and I can&#8217;t wait to see what happens next .", "overall": 5.0}

{"reviewText": "Are you tired of your life? Do you do things that don't bring any meaning in to your life? Are you so busy that you have never thought of these questions before? Do you own a Ferrari? You can spend couple of hours reading this book and might find the answers to your questions or you can keep on rushing and realize these things by yourself on the last day of your life!Robin Sharma is really a great story teller. The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari is a book full of wisdom, advises and lessons about life wrapped in a beautiful story of human transformation and finding a meaning in life. I liked this book, because everything is explained in a simple story way. The main line of the book is about the lawyer who had all the success and lots of money but still lost the meaning and passion in life. Author tells us simple principles which most people forget by rushing over their lives. He reminds us what it really means to live and enjoy everyday blessings. All the book consists of many insights and advises presented in a ear-catching manner.Most people these days rush to make careers, earn money and does other &#34;need to do&#34; things don't even realizing that they are quitting on their real dreams and passions in life. Most people are just doing things not even realizing that they are caught in a closed circuit and really don't go anywhere. Most people are not happy with their lives and those things they are doing are not bringing them any joy. Most people are trying their best for their family, but forgetting the most important - to spend time with the family. This book might be the answer to the question, why are they not happy yet. Happiness is a state of mind that consists of many small blessings in life and most people are just rushing for many things that don't make their lives any more happy and meaningful.  This book might open your eyes and make you see life through a different angle.As hearing some people talking about this book I also noticed one dangerous thing. And that thing is money topic. For some people it might seem that money is not an important thing, but it really is and I don't believe that Robin wants to justify poverty. Money is a tool, to make your life easier and get things you want and you don't need to misunderstand the attitude that money becomes everything in life. Believe me, if you don't have money, happiness is a lot more difficult state to understand. Even the book is called The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari, so you need to have that Ferrari at first in order to be able to sell it. This book is not a permission to make excuses why you are not rich or have not enough money. It just gives you lessons on how to be happy and live a meaningful life.So what car do you drive and which car would you really like to drive .", "overall": 5.0}
{"reviewText": "Most people would say that love is very important in their life and relationship, but how many people really know what love is? Most people don't even have any idea how to love themselves and they already try to love others. Most people are trained how to love by their parents, surroundings and most people don't even realize that the real intimacy of two souls starts in a much different place and proceeds in a much different way!I believe that discovering yourself should be the main task in any person's life! And Paulo Coelho is a master at writing great novels on this topic. It's his second book that I've got a chance to read and I am really very happy that I did so. As I loved The Alchemist, I loved this book even more, but I still think that you should read The Alchemist first!This book caught my attention from the start and I couldn't wait to see what will happen going further through the pages. Every page of the book got my attention until the book was finished. Author touches many interesting themes in this book like love, marriage, fame, obsession, transformation, loss, discovery and journey into yourself. I was really impressed on author's point of view about love in this book. This book even could be read as an amazing and dramatic love story with a happy ending. It could also be read as a discovery of yourself, transformation of human soul. Or it could be read as everything mentioned above. That's the beauty of this story, it is not just a nice love story, but it's also a very deep and philosophical analysis of human behavior and soul.The main line of the book is about the main character who is looking for his lost wife. The story starts from him being arrested for suspicion of being related to his wife's disappearance. The rest of the book is a journey of a great search for his wife. It just a very short description of the book, but everything is more complicated. It's not just a journey to find his wife, it's a journey to discover the real himself as well. The journey into realizing real love, attraction and real intimacy of two souls.I would greatly encourage everyone to read this book. It doesn't matter if you are single, married, divorced or living together for 20 boring (or maybe exciting) years. I believe, that if you read this book with open heart, you will find a lot of spices to make your life and relationship more wonderful than you could have imagined before.So, what is your Zahir .", "overall": 5.0}
{"reviewText": "Are you tired of your life? Do exactly the same Mondays and other days of the week don't make sense to you? Do you feel that there is something more waiting in life for you? If you have such or similar questions I believe this book can be an answer for you! But just reading it and not practicing is not going to make any changes in your life!This book is sequel to Robin's bestseller The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari. Basically it's very similar to the mentioned book, but everything is expanded and explained in more details. The plot is simple, the same monk who sold his Ferrari is sharing his wisdom with the man who has everything in life, but lost meaning of it. He almost ended with a suicide, but accidentally something stopped him and that something became a breakthrough in his life.What I like in this book is that Sharma takes us step by step through all 7 steps of self-awakening. In a story telling way he explains us why they are important and how you can master them. He gives us many advices and insights that can help to transform anyone's life. To make those steps and advises more emphasized the hero of the books teaches his apprentice one step at a time, by showing a lesson each time and making him to experience everything by himself, not just to hear the advice. That makes this book more practical to use for everyone who want great changes in their lives.I believe there are many lost souls in this world and this practical book can really help to find a real yourself and a real meaning of your life. Even if this one book won't help, I believe it will be a first huge step to discover your destiny!So, is your next Monday going to be the same as your last 30 Mondays .", "overall": 5.0}
{"reviewText": "Amazingly shocking and mind-blowing! Masterpiece that you won't forget for a long time! Very futuristic look at the utopian society, technologies and lifestyle. This book really blow me away! It immediately became my favorite novel I've ever read.Brave New World takes us to a very far future, even though it was written about 80 year ago. Aldous Huxley really made a fantastic work, which I was so much surprised and amazed to read. This book got my attention from the start and I couldn't put it away till the end. Life and society are much different in Brave New World. They live by different mindset, values, purpose and meaning than we do in today world (or it just might look like so from the first sight). Everything is based on the idea that everyone belongs to everyone else and happiness is the main priority which should be gotten right now.First of all, people are born artificially and divided into the groups. There are 5 castes in New World's society: alpha, beta, gamma, delta and epsilon. You might understand that alphas are the highest and epsilons are the lowest caste. The main beauty of that is that all society lives in peace and happiness and that is achieved by shaping mindset from the embryo. So everybody is happy at their positions and never thinks about any other opportunities. Artificial drug helps everyone always be happy despite any bad situations. There are no relationships, families or any other factors that might disturb the order. There it is vulgar and unethical to have only one partner.Such life might seem very amoral for many people, but as I said before it just seems different and unacceptable for our world. As I wrote in my previous review about 1984's, it's just a mask, matrix. Look deeper and you will see that our society is not much different. Starting from marriages, most people do that and it's almost never permanent not even including cheats on partners (I mean that cheating is end of the marriage already). Agree? You should. Furthermore, let's take castes. In our world most people think that they have a choice. The true is they don't. Yes, actually everyone has a choice, theoretically, but practically not. Just take an example of riches's children becoming rich and broke's children becoming broke. It's not because of any other conditions or circumstances, but the programming parent's give to their children. So here we have a choice, but everything starts from teacher giving right lessons to the student. So, if you have a successful mindset, you will pass it on through many generations and will get alphas. If not, you will get epsilon generations. I don't want to be mean, just trying to get your attention that everything is possible you just need to start from yourself and there is no time for laziness or any excuses. Let's take one more aspect from the book, like \"I want now and here to get and be happy\". What can you say about our society? It's mostly the same. Most people do something small or worthless now to satisfy some needs not thinking much about the result in the future. I hear a lot \"I want this now, I need this now\" and something really important and meaningful or valuable they delay for a lifetime. The typical culture of consumerism and \"fast food\" (fast life). And I don't mean that it's bad, I mean that everything could be used in a good way and in a bad way. You choose!One more interesting aspect for me is the governance of the society in New World. There should always be a cowboy to supervise the herd. The role of the cowboy in this book goes to world governors. There are just couple of them who supervise all the world. They are the creators of everything and the interesting part of it, that in order to become one of them you should get out of the rat race! But before that you have to realize that there is a rat race. One of them told his story, that when he realized there is more in life, had a choice to go to the island or to train and become one of the world's governors. And the island is the place for people who want to create, explore and escape from the society they are in. All of this is just one more example to see that our world is the same. Most people are so busy with their day-to-day routines that they never realize there must be more in this life. I must say WAKE UP!!!Lastly I would like to look over technologies operating in the New World. It really surprised me that the author who wrote this book in 1931 had so futuristic vision. Mass production cloning, sleep learning, flying cars, artificial drugs with no bad feeling really surprised me.So are you alpha or epsilon? But the main question in not \"what\" you are, it's who you are willing to become .", "overall": 5.0}
{"reviewText": "Excellent and involving till the end. One of the most touching books I ever read in my life. I highly recommend it to everyone and especially to everyone who gave up on their dreams. This book will show you the way to your Personal Legend!The Alchemist involved me from the start. I read this book in one sip. Really, when I started I couldn't put it away till the last page. It might look like it's a novel, but if you read between the lines, you will notice that a novel is just a surface. What is really deep in this story is the personal journey to discover yourself and reach your dreams. I love the way Paulo Coelho presented this journey. I love to dream and reach my dreams, so all the stories about somebody having big dreams and achieving them touches me, especially this one.Santiago is the main character of the story. Actually he can represent everyone on the earth who follows his own dreams. He is just a symbol of will, persistence and victory of life. The story tells his journey to discover himself. Actually, he takes the road to follow his dreams which he saw when he was sleeping. The entire journey is a metaphoric transformation to discover yourself. I don't want to tell all the story here, but can say that everyone of us has our own journey in life. The question is do we take the road? Or do we swim with the river?This book made me understand that life consists of the journey to reach the dreams. It's not the end result that makes all the sense. It's the personal journey that makes it really mater. It's the Personal Legend that you create on the way to reaching your goals. Everything in life is really just a hand length away. The question is what length journey you have to go to see those things. You have to be ready to achieve success, otherwise it will pass through. The personal journey makes you ready when it comes. And this book has everything in it what you need to be a champion in life.So, can you read between the lines? Can you see more than just a trip to Egypt? Share your thoughts .", "overall": 5.0}

I haven't read that book, but saw the movie based on it. I believe many of you did and if not, I greatly recommend you to do so.

Many people struggle in life having no clue where to start and Start Where You Are would be a great choice to start with.Chris covers everything, starting from the circumstances where everybody are at the moment then going on to the past experiences, mastery, simple everyday steps, spirituality and finally to the lessons of really happy life.Most of the lessons in similar or different words I got from other books I've read before. What I liked the most about this book is that all the necessary lessons are really clearly distinguished in one book. Everything is explained in simple words and thoughts. Moreover, this book is not about finances and money. Chris does say that money is important in life, but he talks about it just as a result of happy life.

Most of you know people who are panicky afraid of something going even in a little different way than they are used to. Most of you know people who look with huge eyes when something changes and can't understand what to do now. Most of you are those people. And if you can't answer the question who moved your cheese, this book is really for you!Who Moved My Cheese is one of the first books I've read when I started to be interested in self-development and I'm very glad I've read it. Spencer did a great job by making this book sound as a story, really simple story that a child could read with an interest. That makes this book very easy to read and understand.The main problem discussed in the book is \"changes\" and how people react to it. By using four fictional characters in the story, author basically wants to show us four types of people in real life and four different reactions to the changes. After reading the material, everyone could personalize one of the characters to himself and that will show you where you are in life. Even though the story is fictional, the result in the end is real. Spencer shows real life consequences that happens to any of the characters according to their reaction and action to the changes.The book is really like a moral and I believe it's one of the most important morals in life, because I believe that based on your reaction to changes you get the certain results. On the other hand, certain results come from having a certain reaction to changes. So if you want to see what might happen to you, read this book, and it will be like a laboratory experiment looking at the mice and watching what happens to each of them based on their behavior.So, who are you in the story?

{"reviewText": "Involving till the last word. Beautifully designed dystopic world, which rises a lot of questions about human existence and purpose in this world.Big brother is watching you!\"1984\" is classic novel by George Orwell written in 1949. For me it was very interesting to see how author sees the future (as I know now it's the past), and as the world shown in the book is totalitarian that means no much technology or life development or improvement can be expected. The most interesting technology for me was an all seeing eye, a screen in every place, which is watching every move of every person.The book shows the world after some nuclear war. There are just three countries in that world and they are always fighting. The described country is called Oceania. Winston Smith is the main character of the story. He is working to rewrite/correct the history of the world. The past is rewritten every day, because the system (Big Brother) must be always right. The world without the past or future and without any meaning. People are doing everyday work without even realizing why they are doing that.I liked \"1984\" because it was involving till the end. Even though the time author wrote this novel was the time when all kind of ideological systems were developing, it's still very interesting to see one of the most ridiculous version of them. I was born in Lithuania, where we had the system of communism, but I don't remember much of that because I was too little. But after reading this book it's easier for me to understand older generation, because they were part of that system. So probably they experienced many things written in the book and the consequences of all that are still influencing their lives.On the other hand, as I was reading the book I was thinking, even if that world seems so cruel and ridiculous through my eyes, could it be that we are living in the same world right now? No, not the same from the outside world, but the same from the inner ourselves. The values of the Oceania were: war is peace, freedom is slavery and ignorance is strength. If we take the second one and try it on today's society, I could say that most people don't like to be free. They are looking forward to being enslaved in jobs they don't like and activities that doesn't make any sense also being scared to get fired, because it means that they will have to use their brains to find or start something new. The third value is also very common among nowadays society. As I wrote in my previous post, most people simply ignore the information and feel good about that. The book is very worth reading!So, do we really live in a different world? What do you think .", "overall": 5.0}
{"reviewText": "Genetics is nothing to blame on! If your weight shows numbers that you don't like, it's your job to reduce them. Your body is a very serious part of your life and you should treat it accordingly. Sex? Well, we all believe that we know everything, but a little more knowledge about 15 minute woman orgasm would be a great deal, don't you think so?!Timothy Ferriss is really a great author and a person who likes to analyze and experience things and later on present the conclusions to us. I haven't read his bestseller The 4-Hour Workweek yet, but when reading The 4-Hour Body you can feel that author experienced everything, what he writes about, himself. That's very interesting, because all the advices are based on experiments, experiences, tests and numbers. Timothy loves numbers and tests and I believe that's great, because most things and progresses should be measured and most of them are measured by numbers. What you need is to know what those tests and numbers mean and how to interpret them and Timothy explains everything in his book.This book is about what I would call self-performance, what includes losing fat, improving sex life, getting better sleep and seeking for other improvements in physical abilities. You should never forget that human consists of body, mind and heart (or soul) and all of these areas should be trained equally in a period of life! So this book is mostly about body, though I believe that if you are improving one area of your humanization, at certain degree the other areas are improving as well.There are many books written on dieting, exercising, building muscles, losing fat, having better sex and sleep  and so on. I believe all of them provide certain information on a subject they are written. It's not just another book on similar subjects. What I love about it the most is that Timothy tries to explain most processes happening in/to the body in an easy to understand way why you should do that. Another excellent thing is that all above mentioned topics and many more are covered in one book! Moreover, he doesn't say that you should change your personality completely to lose weight or to improve your abilities. He doesn't suggest any radical changes in your daily eating or living habits, he simply suggests what I would call an improvement. There is no easy or hard way to lose fat or improve your other body abilities. The are only few things that should be done in order to achieve your goals. And this book provides you with one of the methods. You might like it or not, but it works! Everything depends just on you. Reading the book is just 10% of the work, the rest 90% is your part in putting that knowledge in to action!I believe The 4-Hour Body will provide you with experienced information on many facilities of your physical being. It's worth reading, but just if you are going to take an action afterwards!So, do you think your body deserved at least 4 hours of excellent treatment .", "overall": 5.0}
{"reviewText": "Very interesting and inspiring work on governance that could be used for leadership. It's a political treatise and even though this book was written about 500 years ago, all the principles described in the book works very well these days. A very interesting look at the reasons, methods and differences of the governance is presented.Niccolo Machiavelli wrote this treatise as a gift for his those days king. The reason to do so was to explore and to describe the methods on how to govern a country. Actually everything is very easy presented. The author starts by describing differences between the counties and then gets into how and why those counties or areas should be governed. The book is full of real life examples of other nations in different times. Machiavelli describes why some of the countries or empires expanded and why some of them collapsed. Everything is easy explained and it's not difficult to notice, that most of the methods he wrote about are used by today politicians or leaders.As I've read a lot of books on leadership, this one was really interesting because of its age. Actually it might look like this book is more about management, but really there are a lot of hints and methods that turns on to leadership. Furthermore, firstly kings had to be leaders to keep the power in their hands.Moreover, what I liked more about this book, is a deeper look and understanding on how countries are created, what agreements you should make and what you shouldn't do to win. The book revealed many intrigues between kings and their relatives, which led to betrayals and deaths. To conclude everything, I think that the most important thing is not to get the power - it's to keep it for a lifetime and to be remembered as the greatest!Any thoughts?

{"reviewText": "Is Bill Gates who he is today because of the talent he has? Was Steve Jobs such a legendary creator because of his own persistence and visions? That's a good question that Malcolm Gladwell tries to explain in this book based on the opportunities and heritage they had in life. I have a little different opinion or maybe just an addition to his opinion what I think is very important as well!Outliers is the book about success. It's not another success story or a guide how to become successful, even though, after reading such book you can know more about success than you did before. It's a book with a lot of examples and experiments that were carried out trying to identify why some people are successful and some are not. Author tries to go deep into the surroundings that famous and successful people like Bill Gates, The Beatles, Joe Flom and others had in life. Malcolm makes an assumption that no one became successful by themselves, that the heritage and the society made those people into success stories they are. The book is full of experiments and explorations deep into those people lives, which sometimes take many generations before they were born. Author also gives us many statistics, to illustrate some of the facts about successful and not so successful people.What is more different in this book, that everything is explained based on the sequence of lucky opportunities that happened to those famous people. It's like, because of that it happened this and because of this there was a good time or personal character to do something. And like I mentioned before, sometimes it goes deep into many generations before. It might be true and I can't say contrary. Anyway, author agrees that to be successful you have to have certain character features and certain time to use opportunity. That's absolutely true. It's like starting to make a wagon for horse these days is absolute insanity when we are talking about the future of flying cars. But some time ago it was a chance. The same with character, of course you need to have certain features to become successful and author mostly says about why some people have one and other people have other features based on their background and life style. And the conclusion comes that some of them become successful and some don't.Everything there is true and I believe that couple hundred years ago not everybody had so much chances to become successful as we have now. Today really everything is possible and it doesn't depend on any character or background in the end. Yes, it depends at the start point, but the beauty of this is that we can change habits and character, because we have the information that it's possible and moreover we have methods and practices how to do so. It's possible to forgive person when he doesn't know something but it's not fair to do so when he knows the information but doesn't use it. And it's a choice to use or not, but the fact that we have it still remains. So every choice has a consequences and that's also known!Another ingredient to success story in Malcolm's book is opportunity. He talks about the opportunities that those successful people had. He admits that they were ready when the opportunity came, because they made right actions before. I agree one hundred percent with him too - you have to be ready to take an opportunity when it comes to you. And again, the beautiful thing in today world is that opportunities come very often. The problem is that most people don't see them because they are not ready or are too busy with their day-to-day routine. And to be ready is a choice of how you spend you time. Everyone has 24 hours a day, so it's just a choice what will you do during that time. Moreover, today it's possible to take or create an opportunity yourself as information is very easy accessible and everybody knows it!Considering everything that was said, it's a great book, which will help you to see success stories from a different angle. I believe it will help you to see what choices and surrounding can help you reach your goals and which won't. And as I mentioned before, the beautiful thing is that you can change and adapt yourself to become who you really want to be!So what is stopping you from success? Do you see many opportunities in life? Does your character help you .", "overall": 5.0}

Probably everybody who has an access to the computer on this planet saw PSY video Gangnam style and wondered how it's possible that an unknown musician became so very well known and popular in all over the world so quickly? Well, me too, and after reading this Malcolm's book I've got my answers.After reading one of Malcolm's books' called Outliers I found another called The Tipping Point. I liked his first book, so I was pretty sure that this one is going to be very interesting as well. I wasn't wrong. The book is really great because of author's style and ability to put a lot of examples and experiments into the material. That's what makes his works a little different from others what I've been recently reading.The Tipping Point tries to explain why some things (products, fashions, behavior, etc.) become like viruses and spread in amazing speed and volume and why others don't. Even it might look like an accident, it's not, everything has a logical and analytically explanation. This means that everything might be planed and done in a controlled manner. The tipping point is the point, when everything changes and becomes unstoppable viral.According to Malcolm, there are three main factors that play the main role in reaching tipping point and creating a viral effect and he explains them separately in a very understandable way. Author analyzes many cases based on viral impact what leads us to more deep understanding about the cases and the factors. After reading this book it's easier to understand how many commercials are done or marketing companies work. Not all of them are doing this successfully, but some are. It's not enough to know how to do viral effect, but it's still a good start to know that it's possible to do in a controlled manner. It's not fortune anymore, it's just some methods that are already analyzed and being implemented.Moreover, this knowledge can help in a lot of good things, because sometimes bad behavior becomes viral and the only way to stop it effectively is to know how everything works. Knowing that it's possible to spread another virus, which can neutralize the first one or simply not to let bad behavior reach tipping point and become viral.I can't wait to implement The Tipping Point knowledge into my business.Any viral thoughts .", "overall": 5.0}
{"reviewText": "I always hear people complaining about not having enough money, about having debts and how they can't do anything because of that. I'm really sorry for those people, because the biggest debt is in their heads. And the worst is that after reading this book most of them won't change anything. So for those, don't bother, skip this review and this book. But for those, who want to see what a really top class lifestyle and business means - there are 5 billion of reasons to read this book!Donald Trump is a great man. This is not the first book of his that I've got to read. He is one of those people I really admire and I believe everyone can learn a lot from this star of success.I really loved this book. First of all, it's not a tutorial on becoming rich. There is no magic or mystic in this ability. There are just certain things that can lead you to be successful and some that will never do. You choose that! Donald is the believer of hard work. I like this point of view, because nothing comes in easy way. You should understand that while reading this book.Honestly, I didn't learn anything about success from this book. Everything Trump says about success I've already read in other books. As I mentioned before, there are certain things that bring people to the dream life. All successful people use them and talk about them in their books. Just all of them do that in their own manner and from their own point of view. What I love about Donald is his point of view, how he does that.Some people might think that Trump is always praising himself. It might seem like that, but the main thing is that when you came back to the fortune from the debt of almost 10 billion dollars, you have a right to do so. Moreover, when you are creating the top class things, it's another reason to really be proud of yourself. I bet most people who say bad things about Trump are really low class and champions of excuses.Adding more to my fascination about this book, is that I saw all the greatness of creating a world-top-class buildings and other facilities. One thing is to build a small 2 floor building, another is to build a huge and marvelous skyscraper, not even talking about the quality of living inside.In one of the chapters the author describes his work week, hour by hour. It might look stupid, but if you look deeper, you will understand how successful people live and what they do (and what don't - that's very important too!). So after reading this chapter you can compare Trump's week with your week. If you are a billionaire, I believe that it will be pretty much the same. If not? You have where to improve..So, do you choose to live a top class life .", "overall": 5.0}
{"reviewText": "Have you ever been cheated or tricked? Have you ever put so much trust in somebody but eventually it turned out that he/she lied to you? Do you like the feeling of being fooled? I believe you don't!This book is about lies. Before I started to read it I couldn't think that it's possible to write whole book on such topic, but I found out that there are many more books about lies. That surprised me in the beginning, but getting deeper into the pages I realized that it's really a very wide and important topic in our lives. I thought that I never lie, but it turned out that I do, just mostly all of my lies fall into the category of acceptable lies. You will find many interesting information like classification of lies and liars, the accuracy of polygraph, biggest lies in history and many more.There are things that I liked and disliked in this book. The good thing about reading Paul's book is that I really learned a lot of new things and information. Before reading it I just knew that people lie, now I know a lot more about psychology and science of lie. Yes, you can really call it science! I don't mean that I learned everything written in the book, but I can see a bigger picture on this topic now. Another thing that I liked is examples about real historical events. They really made reading more interesting. One more thing that I paid attention to is that author don't claim things, he just says his opinion, results of the experiments and facts beside. That makes it more real, than just to know someone's opinion and take it for absolute truth.What I missed in this book is more pictures of human expressions with different emotions. There are some, but I think it would be more interesting to see more emotions and more different people feeling the same emotion. Reading this book felt like it is more adapted to catch criminals lying. I've missed more examples and information on business lies.I understand, this book is dedicated to see the big image on lie topic. It's not a learning tutorial. So probably my dislikes are not very countable. Anyway, it's a great book on quite an interesting topic.

I'm not too much into novel, but as I liked \"Fight Club\", written by the same author, I decided to read this book as well. I can say, Chuck really surprised me with this book. I didn't expect it to be so sick. Of course it depends on the attitude, of how sick you see it, but even for me thinking to have a wide attitude, the story was pervert. And I don't mean pervert in a sexual way, I mean pervert in mind way.The story basically concentrates on few young people having everything in their lives. What I liked the most, that the author shows what is happening in their heads, but this is fully revealed only in the end of the book. One of the main quotes of the book is: \"Everything we want is what we are trained to want\".

And the most beautiful thing is that you will be able to use that knowledge and become rich as well!Robert Kiyosaki is a wonderful adviser regarding financial issues. Rich Dad Poor Dad is his must have book in any home, because it will definitely improve your financial situation. I believe you will find many answers to the question why you are not rich yet. Robert tells his story of having 2 dads, one who was his intelligent one and the other, who was the rich one. The story starts from the childhood and I believe it's very important, because the knowledge you get being a child lasts through mostly all your life. And here comes very important question of what outcome do you wish to have in your life? This book is a great start of changing your mindset and start living a rich life!I've read this book twice and I think I will read it once a year, because even though some of the information is a little old or not as useful in different countries as it is in US, still the principles and the ideas are exactly the same. Every time reading this book I'm getting a little bit different understanding of what Robert wants to tell us, so I believe reading it once a year will still give me a very valuable new insights.What I love about this book is that it really explains differences between people's mindsets and how those mindsets are affecting their financial life. Mostly if the financial situation is bad, that leads to all other aspects of life to be bad. So by reading this book you will be able to understand the main principles why some people are rich and most are not. Another great thing is that Kiyosaki advocates education a lot. And by saying education he means not the education system, but the education itself, what means constant improvement of you. He really doesn't like the system that is used in many countries to produce just employees, without any knowledge of financial issues and any chance of becoming really rich! And yes, many people are still blindly following the habit, that you need to go to school an get a good education. It's time to wake up, because we are living in different times!And some WARNING at the end: This book won't make you rich - you will!

I admire Randy very much and I admire him even more and more by reading more of his books or any other stuff. I can say it's absolutely must read for every human on this earth and will tell you why.This book hit on me from the very start and I have to admit that I started to write this review even though I haven't finished the book yet. That is because I really want to share my excitement about this book with you. Don't worry I will finish this review only after I will finish the book. There is not much left. The message Randy shares with us is very controversial and eye-opening. Many of you might be shocked and don't agree with the author, but that doesn't change the reality Randy want to show us. The question is why you're dumb, sick and broke? The answer lies in those pages. Everything depends on how you are going to use the information. I found this information extremely priceless and it really helped me to understand why certain things are happening in my life. Knowing this I can act and change things I don't like to create my dream future. I believe you can do the same.One part of this book tells you why most people are not happy with their lives, yet another explains what should you do or don't to fix the situation. That is the beautiful part of it. There are certain laws of wealth and prosperity that you will find in this book. Using them you have a chance to create your desire life. I loved those examples Randy gives in his book, I really love the way he does that, because every example is quite controversial and that forces you to think, and I believe this is one of the reasons this book was written. One of my favorite parts was a imaginable story about new settlers on an island after the plane crash. By reading that story you can exactly see why people are acting in a certain way in this world and what is more important is that you can make a choice, how you want to act in your own life.I can't share all my excitement about this book in this short review, because I would just have to rewrite all of it. That's not my purpose. I just can assure you that this book is one of my most valuable books ever read.Why you have to read this book? The answer is simple: because nobody want to be dumb, sick or broke. And if you struggle in any or all of these ares it might be a sigh that you don't know or understand something. And if you are good in all of those ares this book will help you to strengthen you position and belief.

It's the system of cleaning yourself from any kind of bad thoughts, habits, actions and so on. Even if it looks simple, it's not so simple to use it properly. The first thing you have to do is to take all responsibility for anything coming into your life for yourself. Only by taking it, you have a change to get results practicing this system.The book is written by the man very well-known from the movie \"The Secret\" - Joe Vitale. Author describes his experience about getting to know this mysterious method. The book is based on his relationship with Dr Hew Len, the expert of this system.Personally, my first reaction after starting to read this book was really strange. I couldn't understand much that was written in the beginning and it seemed that it's just a nice story, like a novel. I even started to think to quit on reading this book, what I never do. The first thing that caught my attention and kept me on reading was when I read that Ho'oponopono is a Hawaiian system. I love Hawaii, so I decided to keep on reading till the end. Page after page and I really got involved in the book. I started to analyze and think that it might be true, even if it looks mysterious and too simple to be true.I'm not practicing this method intensively now, still I think about it quite often and sometimes try Ho'oponopono system. It's strange, but I think it's working, just I think I need more time to experience the results. Another thing that I started to love is Ho'oponopono music.

That means that if you have some useless habits you will have to change them to useful ones if you want to live a better life.Latter on Covey tells what those 7 habits are.

And it is, just most of the times it looks like an unusual biography and seems like it was written about the life within the author's mind. This book is my first meeting with C. G. Jung and I should admit that there were parts where I didn't understand exactly what he had in mind. Probably I will have to read it once more in a few years after I'll read more of his works. But I liked it, because it portrays very interesting personality, who spend all his life studying human psychology and basically creating most of today well know psychology works and practices. I am very interested in psychology and it's always very interesting to know the basics.What is interesting in this book, that you can be acquainted with both parts of Jung's life - his life events and his inner life, his mind and thoughts. Both parts are very interesting - his childhood, early years, school, studies, work as a psychiatrist, relationships, trips and so on. Another part is more difficult and as I mentioned above it's not so easy to perceive. Jung talks about his dreams, visions, reflections, that sometimes really seem very crazy. That's why this personality is so interesting to me.I believe you should be ready to read this book and probably you will have to read it couple of times in couple of year's period. If you are interested in human psychology, behavior and philosophical personalities, I believe you will like this book as well.I will finish my review with one of Jung's thoughts that caught my eye in the end: &#34;We become lonely not when we don't have close people, but when we can't share things with them that seems important to us or when we hold on the attitude that is not acceptable to others&#34 .", "overall": 5.0}

This book really gave me a lot of information on many things that are called mystical or miraculous in our society. I got many answers and still many more questions left for the future studies and readings. This book covers many such topics, but basically it's about our brain and how it works. Moreover, and what is very important, it's about how we can use that knowledge about our mind to improve our abilities and lives!Some things in our society are taken for granted and some are considered as mystics or miracles. That is just a lack of information and in most cases just a lack of knowledge, which is actually already researched at some levels and could be available for everyone. Author really made a great work on researching many of the information on such topics as voodoo, shamanism, hypnosis, self-hypnosis, suggestions, consciousness, faith, healing, miracles, autosuggestion, brain waves and many more similar phenomenons. I personally believe that all mystical phenomenons can be explained in a rational way and this book gave me very valuable information that I am not wrong.Another great thing is that this book is full of explanations and guidelines about using many techniques and methods in order to establish or improve our abilities that will definitely influence our lives. Christian gives detailed information about how to use them correctly. That is a great thing, because this book can be used practically as well.Compared to other books on human mind, Mind Dynamics is really very informative, practical, quite technical, and well historically researched. It will give you scientific explanations to many unusual phenomenons and most important it will help you to understand how and why your own mind works.

Richard is one of my most inspiring personalities and this book is exactly what you need to start making your dreams come true.Screw It, Let's Do It covers everything you need to make successful business and enjoy the processes all the way. I've read almost all of Richard's books and even though I didn't get any more knowledge of his life journey in this book, it's still a very good reading to summarize everything I've read in his previous books. It's short, it's simple, it's interesting to read and it has everything you need to start dream building and believing in your even the most crazy ideas.The book is called under the most favorite Richard's expression and it represents the action mode. One of the things that brought Branson to billionaires is action, and Screw It, Let's Do It explains it all. I remember times in my life when I was delaying things and that didn't bring anything good. If I have told myself &#34;Screw it, let's do it&#34; I believe many things would have turned out much better. Richard doesn't say that uncalculated risk is a good thing, but he says that if the risk is measured the the action should be brought in immediately. And he proves that by his achievements!What do you think? Do you delay things and regret about it later .", "overall": 5.0}
{"reviewText": "One of 2 my favorite movies. One of movies' classics masterpieces! I can still remember watching this movie almost 20 years ago, when it appeared on a big screens. Since then I watched Braveheart more than 10 times and every time watching I still get the same feeling as it was the first time. What made me such a huge impression? The simple answer would be - everything. The movie is really done brilliantly. Having in mind that it is almost 20 years old and it's impossible to compare it to today movies, but still this movie can compete with majority of the movies being made today. My second favorite movie is Avatar and I can say that Braveheart is the Avatar in those days.The story line is quite simple, but the implementation of it is astonishing. Mel Gibson did a great job combining all the components together to make Braveheart. The movie has everything: romance, freedom, fight, betrayal, love, will, persistence, idea, legacy and many more elements of life. It's impossible to describe this movie in any review. The only way to understand it is to watch it yourself. I believe, that there won't be anybody left with no feeling after this movie .", "overall": 5.0}
{"reviewText": "How good can you accomplish a task assigned to you? Ever wondered why some people simply get things done and the majority are just making themselves busy by looking for reasons not to do something? I'm sure you can find many answers to those questions by reading this short story!A Message To Garcia is a very short story written more than 100 years ago. The main purpose of it is to make you understand why there are so little people on this earth who can really accomplish the task. Most people can start or do something in some manner, but just the very few can really be trusted to finish the job without looking for excuses. The most beautiful thing about it is that everyone can choose by themselves to be that person. You don't need any native born skills or features. Actually you don't need anything extraordinary, just the right attitude which you choose by yourself! This book doesn't teach you anything, it just tries to make you think and choose your attitude.The story is relevant these days probably even more than it was 100 years ago, when it was written. Most people say that they want to get something first and only then they will do their best. I don't believe them. I saw many people, who get what they've asked for, but never do their best and probably never will. I believe that if you do your best, you will always be rewarded and I've proved that many times in my life.One of my principles in life is always to do my best whatever I do, and if I don't want or don't feel like doing my best, then I just quit that activity as fast as I can and start something where I can do my best. By reading this short story I realized that this principle was always very important despite the century people are living in. I really recommend you to read this book, not because you will be able to understand why so many people can't be trusted on tasks, but to change your own attitude and get things done immediately!Can you deliver a message to Garcia? Or will you just start questioning: why? who? where .", "overall": 5.0}

The same apes are living by the fictitious savage dogmas. No questioning, just a blind belief in what is created to be an absolute true. How much human is left there in the society?Aldous Huxley is really very talented philosophical writer. Ape And Essence is his second book I've read after Brave New World. As I've expected, this book made a huge impression on me. I admire author's ability to create great stories and show the world in the most deep philosophical way. I like this book very much, because it reminds us what it means to be human. Author beautifully paints world based on created norms that nobody knows where they came from but takes it as an absolute true.This time Huxley takes us to the future after the nuclear world war. From the surface this book looks different from Brave New World, but actually it's the same insane life, where nobody is really living their own life. It shows us empty post-apocalyptic world where only few survivors are left and are trying to create society again. Everything is told through the eyes of the scientist who came from New Zealand, the only country which was not touched by the war.Interesting fact is that author takes a scientist who looks like he is still living in our known today world and puts him in the conditions of the future post-apocalyptic world, where people are building a society on savage totalitarian and religious fundamentals. And that looks so unacceptable and inappropriate through his eyes, as well as through the readers' eyes. But if you look more deeper, you might see that the world we are living today is not much different, most people are so used to the dogmas, values, routines and imposed norms that most just take them as an absolute true even though sometimes they feel that it doesn't have any meaning to them and just makes them live by the inertia. And here the question rises, is the imagination of the Huxley just a fantasy, or is it a reality just made up with a different make-up?Another interesting thing that I've noticed while reading this book is that those people used books just as firewood to cook and satisfy similar needs. This is not the first book where I've noticed such behavior with books. The misuse of the books was pictured in Brave New World and in Orwell's 1984 as well. I believe these authors want to show that reading books is one of the greatest ways to grow in life and nobody from those stories was interested in this fact. It's sad, but even in our world most people don't use their reading abilities at all, they just forget that and I believe it's equal to using the books as firewood.So how much ape do you have inside you .", "overall": 5.0}

I've read many books on this topic and I really admire this book, because it's short, everything is concentrated and presented beautifully simple. Don't take me wrong, many books teach us how to do certain things in the best way. They are very important if you want to be successful in the sphere you are in. This book is about the concept of what you need to become rich and successful in life and these principles can be implemented in whatever you do. Though, you will still need the certain knowledge about the thing you are doing in life.I've read this book couple of times. It was one of the first books, which I've read more than a year ago. I've read a lot of other books before I came back to this book again. Very powerful, I can say that everything in The Science Of Getting Rich is very potent! The book is involving and addictive from the very beginning. First chapter - The Right TO Be Rich. Strait away the author talks about human nature right to be rich and to have the things that make life to be fulfilling. I believe many people might judge him because of his point of view, but as he says himself, it's just the excuses for laziness.If you are struggling or looking for something in life, I greatly recommend you this book, I believe you will have a clue where to start!So, do you have an excuse for not being rich .", "overall": 5.0}

I was shocked, amazed and fascinated of the vision Randy shares with us. This book is much different from many success literature, it is something different I even expected from Randy. The main message Randy wants to share in this book is to cause us to think. In this book he does not tell us anything what or how to think, by telling all those thing he just causes us to think. And in my mind that is the reason this book is a must read for everybody who can read letters!!!Risky is the new safe sound really strange for many people, it simply denies everything we were taught to know. But it is TRUE. World have changed and rules of life have changed and now no lifestyle is safe until it is RISKY. Life tempo is getting faster and faster and many people never stop to see what is coming and what are those changes bringing them - problems or opportunities. And in my opinion this is one of the reasons why you guys should really get a copy of this book for yourself and for ones you love. For some of you it will be shocking and mindblowing. Others will find the answers to their questions like I did. Some of you guys will get a million dollar idea. I believe there will be ones that will throw this book in the corner after reading. I think every choice is acceptable, but give yourself a chance to see the world upside down.Prepare to get a lot of information that is unusual to you. You will choose to believe it or not, to admit it or resist. The fact is many things will happen despite of our will and our role is to see an opportunity in whatever is happening!!!I would like to share with you my favourite Randy's message: \"You must be willing to let go of who you are to become who you are meant to be\", - Randy GageEnjoy your reading guys .", "overall": 5.0}

I've read couple of great books that can help you to find your WHAT, but this one I like particularly because all this book is about it. Steve Olsher is a brilliant author who dedicated all the book to help you find your WHAT, make sure of it and use it to create life you desire.What I like a lot about this book is that everything is distinguished in very understandable order. Moreover, the book encourages you to act right now by having all those exercises that helps in finding your WHAT and using it. That is very important for me, because it really makes you use the knowledge you get. The book is like a guide to your real potential. Of course it will help only under the condition that you will be accurately doing all the exercises. I already have my WHAT, but still it was very worth to do the exercises to check on them.All the examples presented at the end of each chapter are really inspiring and instructive. You can discover a lot of inspiring and brilliant personalities and you can use their knowledge and work to improve yourself even more.

This book is a sequential book to the precursor The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari. I can't say that it's better or worse than the first book, because it's quite different. Different in style, not in the primary meaning. This book is not written in a story style, it's more step by step tutorial  and all advises are distinguished and explained one by one. And because of this style, I believe that this book is very clearly and easy understandable. Stories are important as well and they help us to realize things easier, but after stories it's always a good thing to have a step by step guide, which will remind us the most important lessons.What I liked in this book is that author really emphasizes that money is not a bad thing and it helps you reach your dreams easier. I believe this is very important, because as I mentioned after reading The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari, some people might get an idea that you don't need money in life. And that's not correct. So in this book author explicitly mentions that money is important, just you don't need to make everything only about money.I really encourage you to grab this book, read it and try it!

{"reviewText": "Atheistic look to the human being. The author, Julien Offray de La Mettrie, explores the theory of human flash and soul being indivisible and basically operating as a machine. Following that, all human behavior and existence is explained on the basis of physics and chemistry.A book written more than 260 years ago. Sincerely, it was one of the most difficult books to read even it's quite short. I can't say that I liked it and can't say that I didn't. It is just a lot different from all the other literature I've been reading so far. Still I'm very glad I read this book. It showed me more how people were thinking and creating different ideas and theories about human existence hundreds of years ago. Actually it is interesting that the author had so much courage to publish such a work back in those days. Nowadays religion is not as strong as it was 260 years ago and the book is very against the dogmas of church.I really like authors thought that the human is what he eats. I think it is a lot true, because what you eat defines how you feel, and how you feel most likely to define how you act what leads to what results you get in life.

So in this book you can find all the life story of the man who played the main role in creating and developing those amazing technologies and the company itself.

Of course, I haven't read this book in one sip, but until I was finished I could think only about what's next. Another thing that fascinates me a lot, is that in this book there are a lot of dreams, struggles, challenges and victories. Jobs himself was a very difficult, but interesting personality. Some people hate him, some love, some do both, but there is none who don't have any of these feelings for him. His vision was huge, his dreams were unrealistic. Despite all of that, he made everything to make them come true.I greatly encourage you to read this book.

{"reviewText": "Change your mindset, change your life. Change your living place, change your..hmm..My interpretation of this story!Russell Conwell wrote this book/story more than 100 years ago. It's one of the stories that started a self-help era of literature. The book was born after many lectures told by the author himself. The story is short and the main idea is that if you want to be happy and successful you should look for that where you are. Russell talks mostly about people or emigrants who leaves their home and searches for the happiness somewhere else.I've read this book twice, but still can't understand it exactly. I have just my own interpretation. I don't think that you should understand everything word by word, it might be dangerous. I am cosmopolitan myself, and I look at the whole world as my home. Not the country, not the city. Maybe times changed and the world became smaller (in the meaning that today we can reach any corner of the world in some hours or talk to a person anywhere in some seconds), but I personally don't believe that we should stick to the place we were born at. I believe we have a choice where to be and where to live despite of the fact where we were born. I agree with the author on the idea that it's possible to be happy and make a success in any place where you are and you don't need to look for that somewhere else, but sometimes you just want to experience the world and find some other place to live and to be happier.My interpretation is that acres of diamonds is your mind and your mindset. I think that you should change it first to be happy and successful, because if you just change the place and your mindset will stay the same, nothing really good will happen in your life. You must look into your acres of diamonds first to find the treasures held in you. Of course, changes in life, living place, country or other circumstances sometimes help you to change your mindset easier and to discover you acres of diamonds, but still it's the first thing you should deal with. And this book is one of those which will help you to change your mindset!Do you have any other interpretation of this story .", "overall": 5.0}

It's a book about any human's view to life. What/Who is creating you? Is there any circumstance which makes your life as it is, or is that you - yourself? Although many people are thinking that their life is based on many different circumstances, it's not true. You are the only one who creates those circumstances around you. The simple answer is that there are actions and there are outcomes. Certain actions create certain results in your life and those actions begin with your thoughts. The circumstances just make your actions sharper.I agree with the author for one hundred percent. We are what we are thinking every day, what is deep in our hearts. One of the sayings is that &#34;Money spoils people&#34;. It's not true. Money just makes people to be more visual for who they really are. If person is good in his heart and thoughts, no money will make him evil, but if he is not, everything will make him bad.The good news is that we can change everything with no additional circumstances or features. We can change our lives just by starting to think in a different direction. It will require will, persistence and patience, but that's the only way to do that. If you are happy with your life, great!

Great man who changes the world and great book that can change your mindset and attitude towards the world. Richard is one of my teachers (through the books), and he really makes a big difference in my mind when reading all the experience this great man can provide me with. I believe, he can be a leader for many of you too!I love the way Richard Branson looks to the world and to the businesses. He is really very inspiring personality, who really has a lot of influence to my life. Business Striped Bare is not the first Richard's book I've got to read, I read almost all of his books and even had a chance to meet him. Since I've started to be interested in Richard my hunger to meet him started to grow. Now I have another dream, and it is to start some great project (business) with this amazing person and work with him together.This book really blew my mind. It's full of priceless advises which comes from experience of creating one of the biggest brands in the world - Virgin. It really opened my eyes to see more global things and to think more global. The book is distinguished into couple big chapters where Richard explains the most important parts of the business like right people, brand, trust and commitments, failures and learning from them, innovations, leadership and social responsibility. This last chapter really got my attention. I really love how Richard looks to the world from social spectrum. Even though some people might not agree with me, but this man is really changing the world into the better place. All the projects he describes in the book are really of great value (and I don't mean value in money). All the innovations Richard is trying to develop are so amazing that it really will change the face of the world in couple of years. That's where my mind stops to look at small things and tries to see big opportunities and really valuable (not just in money) things. We all can do something but after reading and understanding some of Richard's thoughts it becomes so strange to care about just any worthless thing.One of the things that really inspired me a lot was the board of old and very respectable people from the entire world. For those who have never heard of this, it's a group of people who meet to discuss the global problems of the world and none of them is politician or has any other interest except really big experience in life and a wish to make world a better place. This really made me to dream one day to be one of those people.Considering all above I can say that Business Striped Bare is a very strong book. I really recommend it to everyone who really are in business and want their business to grow big. Richard managed to create such an amazing empire and he really has so many advises which could be used to be successful.

Heath is a sensitive topic and ask yourself honestly, how much do you know about it (I mean know, not imagine or have somebody else's opinion as yours)? Do you think that the goal of pharmacy industry is to help people? As a business owner I will tell you that the main goal of business is profit. Everything else might be just the second!Health is one of the most serious issues to many people. Doctors, hospitals, drugs and other health related things are very important in life for most people. The main question is how much do we really know about this sphere? And how much do we trust authorities that are in this field? Most people don't pay too much attention to their health until something goes wrong with them. And after this happens most people simply blindly trust any kind of doctor thinking that he knows what is the best for them. It might be true that most doctors should know more about health than we do, but there comes another very important question - if they are trusted so much to know what's better for us, might there be a manipulation of that knowledge? It's a very serious question that most people never ask themselves.This book is written by a man who spent many years working for the pharmacy companies and his claim is that most of those companies simply work for profits and do many evil things to achieve it. He describes his experience of doing unmoral things himself. Of course, most facts still can't be approved by the certain evidences and sometimes this story even might sound like one of conspiracy theories, but still it raises many serious questions.You might read this book and take everything as an absolute true or you can read it and take it as an absolute nonsense. It's your choice and you will have certain outcomes by making your decision. Or it is possible to read this book and make a critical thinking of what might be true and why it might be true. I personally take the information in the book more as true than as nonsense. The reason for that is that everything what I see around is more likely to claim the story than to deny it.One of the chapters is about artificially made diseases. It's not about creating physical viruses (I believe that is possible as well), it's more about creating what I call mind viruses. It's when you put a fear into society's minds about some illness and suddenly you come up with the cure for that. In such case most people get sick (mentally) and buy cure even they have never needed that if they've never knew that. And this is one of those things that I really see around by myself. Even this makes the information in the book consider more correct that incorrect. You should be blind if you don't see all those ads on TV, streets, screens of various drugs. I don't need them, but most people simply do, because they see and believe. Another question that I ask myself is what is the pharmacy industry really capable of? And what is it is just showing us?Your thoughts. Are you sick just because there is a cure for your illness .", "overall": 5.0}

Utopia books make me wanna shout \"wake up\"!The more I read about utopia societies, the more I love this world and the more it seems to be the best world to live in. Just finished reading the book The City Of The Sun by Tommaso Campanella and it really seems like a copy of Utopia by Thomas More, which I read couple months ago. The style of writing and the way author express himself through the material is very interesting considering the century it was written. Though, Tommaso was absolutely familiar with the More's treatise Utopia, and the style of both books is similar not accidentally. Sincerely, I like the \"original\" Utopia more.If you still don't consider our world to be utopia and still dreaming about living in those fiction utopias it's a great book for you to read. What really made me think reading this book is that Tommaso builds his City of the Sun on the society he actually lived in. It seems that utopia is just what actually exists but everything that is considered bad is removed and everything considered good is magnified. That's it, nothing more nothing less. Moreover, the religion is exaggerated what is strange having in mind modern utopias that really denies religion. But having in mind the century the book was written (more than 400 year ago), probably it's the norm.In addition, The City Of The Sun really look like a mix of the modern days authors' books' The New Brave World and 1984. Not considering technologies, just taking the society's lifestyle and traditions, it really looks having characteristics similar to both of the modern novels. And still I don't love the robotized society. Even though the book describes happy people, I still don't see any personalities and any sense of their existence, but probably that's the point of utopia world.I just want to make some analogues to our world. One of them is that society in the book is so busy doing everyday activities that people don't even have time to realize themselves and their actual needs or existence. They are blindly following the order of the state, the formed needs and formed happiness. Sadly, but our world is the same. Most people are so busy doing everyday routine activities, following formed opinions and needs that are basically not their own. It seems the same robotic. The good thing is that in our world we can wake up, we have everything we need to do so and if utopia dreams doesn't make you more robotic, if you feel somehow that you need to escape from sleeping life, one of the best books to read is Why You're Dumb, Sick and Broke...And How To get Smart, Healthy and Rich by Randy Gage.If you have some additions or different opinion, please, share and discuss it together .", "overall": 3.0}
{"reviewText": "Old idea and old book, even though, the ideas are still very alive these days. One of the most influencing humanism works written 500 years ago by Thomas More. I like the book but I miss the point of creating utopia world. What about you?Interesting thing but the word \"utopia\" came from this book as we know it now. Thomas created it in this book by describing in his mind the ideal society, ideal place and ideal life. Utopia is written in a story style and that makes it very easy to read and understand. Recently I've read some other books describing opposite to utopia, which is called anti-utopia. It was very interesting to see the differences between all of them.Utopia is a fictitious place and the author describes it as an ideal place for society to live. Based on fictitious story teller he describes many different aspects of life like cities, authorities, crafts, communication, relationships, trips, slaves, war and belief. What I didn't like is that through my eyes many things are based on Christianity or has some color of it. That makes me to think that basically this utopia society is based on emotional and not reasonable aspects.Me personally I'm not admiring the idea of utopia. I think it has many disadvantages. What caught my eye is that in this book there is not mentioned some really important aspects like passion (in any ways like sexual, activity and even life). Sometimes this book reminded me Brave New World. It's similar that in utopia nobody possess nothing and in Brave New World everyone else belongs to everyone else. It doesn't really much differ in mindset, just in surface. What I really doesn't admire in utopias is that they deny personality and destroys character only leaving human as a small part of society. It seems that you can change any two people with places and nothing will change or have any difference. It's possible that in many cases the same would happen in our world, but here at least we have a chance. Actually I think utopia might be more admired by those, who want somebody else to do more for their good.Most utopias tries to make people equal, but it's not right, because happiness is not equal and it can't be. Everyone's happiness is different that means you can't give everyone the same things and expect that they will react the same, because people should want different things in life. People shouldn't be computers programmed by the same program. I think that we are living in quite an utopia world. Everyone who is not programmed by memes (or even is) has different wishes and understands happiness differently. And the most beautiful thing is that everything is possible in our world nowadays.

The author of the book is my favorite billionaire Sir Richard Branson. As he loves to fly himself, it is very interesting to see this history of the airship through his eyes. I really enjoyed finding out how all that what we now have in air traffic was developed. Branson presents the facts in a very nice way where you can see people's visions, attempts, persistence, fails, successes and finally where all that led to.Not much time have passed since first attempts to fly were made. It's only a little more than two hundred years since first hot air balloon lifted from the ground and now we already have spaceships, which can fly to other planets. The same is with the travelling speed. It changed dramatically in just a couple of decades. Everything developed so fast, that it's hard to imagine where we are going to be in another one hundred years. Branson himself established the company called Virgin Galactic, which can take you to the space and everybody can become an astronaut. It's already possible!It's also a huge opportunity for new businesses. It might be difficult for many of you to see it in a business way, but some people are already doing it. As I mentioned before one of them is Richard Branson. Moreover, space hotel is being made for those who want to spend some time watching the earth from the skies. Many other opportunities are opening and author gives us a look through all the history to the future. One more interesting fact I found out in this book was that the first airlines were established even before first airplanes were really made to fly. That's the vision! Now is the next step. All of that you will be able to read in Reach For The Skies.So where is your ceiling? The Moon? The Mars? or maybe something much bigger .", "overall": 5.0}
{"reviewText": "The book written by Sir Richard Branson himself. It's not his first book which I had a chance to read. Yet Losing My Virginity is one of the best books I've read in my life so far. Richard is one of my inspiring personalities and probably that's why for me this book is even more special. I believe, everyone, who has big dreams and want them to come true should read about how virginity is really lost.Losing My Virginity title was chosen not accidentally. One of the reasons was to make a catchy title for the book, to attract more attention and in my opinion it played out very well. Another reason is that the empire created by Richard is called Virgin. To sum up all that, this book is very worth reading, and it's not the title that makes it unforgettable - it's the real story, that makes this book epic!And the story begins with Richard's childhood. If you think that rich people are born, you are wrong. Author himself wasn't born with a silver spoon in his mouth. He had to earn everything himself and that journey wasn't simple. Getting into those pages you will find how Richard started, developed, almost collapsed couple of times, struggled, fought and finally made the impossible.What I love the most is the story itself. For me it was inspiring, motivating and forcing to think big. Never stay satisfied only with small things and always keep looking for the things that truly matter. I admire Richard's attitude to life. He was always trying to have fun in business, always prove that everything is possible, and when you read this book it seems that the word \"impossible\" simply don't exist in the dictionary.I like that Richard is really open in this book. He wrote not only about business but also about his love adventures, women and sex. Moreover, this story reveals fights for the true, reputation and honor. It's so involving that I couldn't put it away until I knew the end.I believe, everybody will find a lot of priceless advises, ideas and courage in this book. If you'll read it with an open mind, I believe the word \"impossible\" will start to disappear from your life!So what is your story of losing your virginity .", "overall": 5.0}

{"reviewText": "I usually don't read books like this and that's probably the reason why I gave it just 3 stars. I usually look something that I could take for myself from the book. I don't want to say that there is nothing to take from this book, but it's not much. For me this story is more like romance and struggle in love story than a story of human transformation and finding something meaningful in life. It's a classic story of bad boy and innocent girl who finally find each other and the bad boy changes to good side. Many movies are made on this topic and many books are written as well. I usually look for more meaningful lessons or stories in the books.Reading this book it usually seemed that I'm reading some Gothic theme literature, more likely to be some vampire story. It's too much darkness in this book. I understand that it's a novel and it's creative work, but I'm looking from the perspective of what I can learn from this book. And as I mentioned above it's too much to read all this book, just to understand that you are the only one to fight your darkness within.I could recommend this book for people who like dramatic love stories, vampire love stories or similar - you might find it interesting, but as a literature of human transformation and lessons in life, sorry, there are much better books on that purpose .", "overall": 3.0}

I watched this film some time ago, but still can remember as one of the most interesting movies. Probably one of the things that made me love this film is the idea about mystery or in other words about illusionist. That kind of thing always was interesting to me. Moreover, this movie kept the tension and intrigue till the end. The most interesting part was that the main trick, the main illusion was going in a different way that a spectator could think of. I don't want to uncover the plot here, because it will be more interesting to watch it for yourself.

{"reviewText": "Jim Carrey is really a great actor. I personally admire him more in comedies, but this movie proved that he could play any role in acting. I saw The Number 23 couple of times. It made me a big impression then I saw this film the first time, because I didn't know anything what was going to happen and the most interesting thing is that the movie kept the tension all the time till the end. Even in the end of the movie, when everything became more clear, there raised a new question - &#34;why&#34;, which kept the tension even more longer.The idea of this movie is mystical. The name of the film tells us a small hint - number 23. Everything what happens in this movie is connected to this number and the main character (Jim Carrey) gets obsessed with this thing. His obsession evolves to actions what finally ends in a very unexpected way.I was trying to look at this situation logically. From the experience I've got and the books I've read I know that everything is possible to explain in reasonable way. One of the facts is that we see what we want to see and where we concentrate our attention. Moreover, it depends on what is usually going on in our heads. After watching this movie, couple next days I saw number 23 couple of times. I payed attention to that, that's why I saw it. I didn't count the times I saw other numbers those days and that doesn't mean that number 23 was following me.Wish you a great watching!

{"reviewText": "One of the greatest movies I've ever seen! Why? Because this movie has everything what you need for a spectacular view. Actors are not superstars, but it's the least important aspect in movie if you have everything else in it's places. The acting is great, special effects are superb, filming and directing has nothing more to add to. The story line is not new or something what you have never heard before in different interpretations. What I love is that even the story is simple, but the presentation and implementation of it is made the best way I could imagine!James Cameron is the director of this movie, and what I love about him is that he has an incredible ability to make masterpieces while many other directors can just make something. One of the most admirable things is that this movie, Avatar, changed the course of movies industry. James Cameron showed everyone that movies can be watched in 3D. He didn't invented 3D technology and I know that. Steve Jobs didn't invented many things too. What makes these 2 men similar and what makes me admire them and their works is the ability to make great masterpieces and change the course of history!I greatly recommend this movie to everyone .", "overall": 5.0}
{"reviewText": "Sometimes it seems that your life is a mess? Or maybe it's more often than just sometimes.. There could be some reasons for that and I believe that some of them could be solved by reading and implementing the principles which are found in The Four Agreements.I didn't read this book, I listened to the audio version of it and I think there is no difference while you are getting the wisdom being presented to you. I listened to it maybe five times and going to do it many more times. That's one of the advantages while driving the car: you can use your time wisely and get some self-development happening!I should admit that some similar information I've got earlier from other books. What I love the most about audio version of this book is that information is presented in a story telling manner what makes it very interesting to listen. This book made me look to everything in my life from another angle. The author presents four simple, but very powerful agreements that can really change your life. I'm still practicing to get used to those principles. Even it's simple to understand, it's more difficult to implement. On the other hand, the examples make it all easier.Have you ever thought about human domestication? Well, if you never did, than after listening/reading The Four Agreements you will understand that we are not any different than any other living beings on this planet. And we are domesticated to be humans, so it might be that most of us really don't even know what it really means to be a human. We are humans just the way we are taught to be humans.Back to four agreements, you will be surprised how obvious they can be. Most of them you are using everyday, unfortunately mostly in a wrong manner. I don't want to write them here, because just writing them without explanation would be meaningless. I greatly recommend this book to everyone who wants more balance, peace and freedom in their life. I believe this book will cause you to think if you are prepared to look at everything what you've been taught from another angle.Does domestication program that you've got help you in your life .", "overall": 5.0}
{"reviewText": "Very good science fiction movie, with beautiful effects and great acting! Of course, many scenes were made with a lot of help of computer and graphics, but that's the beauty of using the technology to create something great. I personally expected some more deep story line. For me it was similar like The Matrix. Just in The Matrix human's don't even realize there was a war and in Oblivion they believe they have won the war but they have to leave..One of the things that really mesmerised me was the house where the main characters were living. Amazing house with even more amazing pool. I wish to have such living place for myself:)This movie raised me a question about what we believe to be true. Do we really know that something is true or we are just taking the things other people or authorities are telling us and considering them to be true? As you'll see in the movie, there is no true, there is just a created reality we are living in. Even though the scenes in the movie are science fictional, the concept of human life is a reality which is happening around you every day just in different forms .", "overall": 4.0}

Of course, I read the book about Steve some time ago before the movie was released. So, after reading the book firstly, the movie didn't make me a big impression. I was absolutely obsessed by the book and compared to this, the movie was just OK. I admit, that Kutcher's acting and directing of the movie is great, but the story itself is missing the thrill which you get from the book. When I was reading the book, sometimes I got the shiver by reading things described in the book (mostly the achievements of Steve). I didn't feel anything similar in the movie.I don't want to say, that the movie is not worth watching. Yes it is. But just one time.

This movie has a little everything, like drama, romance, action, fun, betrayal, crime and thriller. Such movies help me to dream build, because that's why I like them.

It's very important in life, because everyday we are making some kind of business or negotiations. Another thing that can be learnt from this movie is to dream big and play big.

Because it's nothing new, funny, worth telling others or worth using any lessons from the movie. The story line is very weak and worthless. On the other hand I should admit that directing of the movie is not bad, it's very good. My judgement of this movie is not based on the movie itself.

There was a time in my life when I was watching a lot of movies and then I decided that it's enough to waste my time watching other people's lives.

{"reviewText": "I have now been using the Haan SI-70 for about 6 months.  I love it. It meets my expectations.  I bought it after reviewing and reading reviews on a number of machines. Consumer Reports had listed an earlier version as their top pick but mentioned several negative issues such as a weak handle.  As soon as I put this machine together, it was as though they had read the same article and gone back to the drawing board and made the necessary corrections.  The only issue that will never be solved is having a long enough cord.  Really not an issue of importance to me and easily resolved with a longer extension cord or a smaller house.1. I would recommend using mineral free water just as you should in your cloths iron.2. Try following the directions.  The directions are important.  Don't, for example, place the pad on the machine as it warms up. They give you a rubber pad to place the machine on as it warms up. You are not trying to work with a wet pad but a pad though which the steam can flow. It is all in the directions and my wife has proven that that does not necessarily mean people follow them.3.  There is a learning curve with this and any other steamer.  It feels as though you are moving a lot more slowly which is true. I followed the directions and take about a four foot square and slowly move the steamer over a path once, move over and go over a second area and then pass over the 1st area a second time.  That removes the tough dirt. The key is not to rush and change the pads when they get wet. Again, it is all in their directions. Ultimately, I find this considerably faster and more satisfying than mopping in the traditional manner.4.  I believe that rugs should be vacuumed first and then again after use of the steamer, again in the directions.  Remember, it kills the mites and bacteria that live in your rugs.5.  I also found that being able to remove the steamer and use it on my bedding  worked great. It is not a fast process but once a month is not that bad. Again, dust mites and bacteria can be destroyed.6.  For the price, the Haan is a great purchase .", "overall": 5.0}

I have found no way of working around these issues.  I went to their site as suggested in a blog and downloaded any updates suggested and was seriously optimistic.  Great, now instead of the X appearing, the program simply freezes and reports the \"experience problem.\"  I even went so far as to cut out the offending segment, eliminated any transitions, titles, etc. but the program simply freezes in a new spot.If you think that this product is supported, forget it.

{"reviewText": "Having bought this buggy as an entry level product with a view to getting back in to buggy racing then it was just what I was after. You can run it virtually stock in many clubs and this means it's down to your driving as to whether you win. It's great flying over jumps and better than the slash in this respect. However, you are well advised to buy the wheelie bar as under full throttle it wheelies virtually every time, which you may think is fun, and it is to start with but when you fire the power down hard coming out of a tight turn then it's just what you don't want. They are around $11-12 on amazon and are what I would class as an essential purchase. Buying a set of bearings will help increase the speed and more importantly the run time, and I'd recommend fitting a set as your second upgrade. Both of these are normally accepted mods but if you are planning on going racing check your clubs class rules.Battery life? 8-12 mins with the standard battery and then 8 hours for a recharge is not much fun, so budget for a larger capacity Nimh battery and a fast charger, the first will increase your run time, the second will charge it back up in around 45 mins, much more fun for you and /or your kids.You can even fit a Lipo 2S but will need a matching charger, combined this could cost you $150+. I would therefore suggest a 5000Mah Nimh on amazon at under $50 and a fast charger at $30-40 will be a much better bet for most people. You can purchase an 8 cell hump pack which will also increase the Rustlers top speed to over 40mph with the extra gear fitted. Note though that to fit an 8 cell pack you will need to fit the 'Battery expander pack' - a bargain at under $6.I would therefore say the rustler gives great fun in the back yard or on the racetrack at a very low price, but budget for an extra battery, fast charger and wheelie bar as they are all essential. The bearings are a good 'nice to have' option .", "overall": 4.0}

{"reviewText": "Sapphique is a dystopian/science fantasy book by author Catherine Fischer, and is the sequel to the first book in the Incarceron series, Incarceron. The book is about a hero Finn, whom has escaped the prison of Incarceron, leaving behind his friends Kiero, and Attia. Upon his return, Finn finds that his stepmother is trying to prevent him from becoming king, and the warden of Incarceron has become trapped in the prison himself. The daughter of the Warden has become infatuated with proving Finn to be the lost heir to the throne and rightful king. Finn, and Claudia's life are put into Finn's hands based upon his ability to convince the courts that he is indeed the lost heir to the throne.There were quite a few aspects of this book that I enjoyed about this book. The story was filled with an amazingly large amount of content for the reader, but moved at such a fast pace, while giving excellent descriptions of what was going on. The use of imagery was actually quite excellent. For example when there was a description given of the glove of Incarceron, it was as if you could actually see the glove levitating right before you. Although the book had a wealth of quality content that I found to my liking, there were a few things that I didn't enjoy so much. For example, one thing that I didn't enjoy in the book was the dialogue, interaction, and actions of some characters. The dialogue for one, was quite confusing at time. Also, I found Kiero, and Attia's relationship quite dull, as there seemed to be a sense stagnancy to the romantic side of their relationship. It seemed as though their relationship was more mutualistic for their survival while Incarceron, rather than as a couple whom loved each other. Also I found that the actions of the warden's daughter, Claudia were quite unorthodox. Although this was a science fantasy book, I still can't grasp why she would cling to Finn so much, even when he showed disdain for her following, and affection. However, she was still an important character as far as the development of the overall story.Despite the unorthodox actions of the characters, with their odd interactions, dialogue, and all I found this book to be unsurprisingly excellent. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys science fantasy, and dystopias, of course. If Catherine Fischer did choose to write another book for the Incarceron series, I would read it without hesitation, because Sapphique is a quality read, that was enjoyed greatly by myself .", "overall": 4.0}
{"reviewText": "The Hobbit (or There and back again) is a fantasy novel written by author J.R.R. Tolkien. The novel focuses on the life of a hobbit, a small humanoid creature with hairy feet, named Bilbo Baggins. Bilbo is a young Hobbit, who lives a quiet life, up until an old wizard named Gandalf the Grey makes an unexpected visit, which brings a multitude of guests (specifically Dwarves). The Dwarves employ a reluctant Bilbo Baggins as a burglar on their trip, as Hobbits are told to be extremely light on their feet. The rest of the book follows Bilbo on his journey with the Dwarves, and Gandalf on a quest to reclaim the mountain (the Dwarves&#8217; home) from a fire dragon, called Smaug, and explains how Bilbo came into the company of a powerful ring.There were several things that I enjoyed in this this novel. The first thing that I took liking to was the style in which this novel was written. There was a very enjoyable sense of calmness, pacing when this book was written, and it shows in the novel. There is a wealth of content, which is quality, and forces the reader to continue reading page after page. Another few things about the book that I enjoyed were the introduction, and development of the characters. In the beginning of the book Bilbo seemed to be a self-concerned, cowardly, stubborn, and timid Hobbit. Slowly, but steadily, Bilbo became a strong, independent, confident, and open-minded Hobbit due to the company, of the Dwarves and Gandalf. The Dwarves, were introduced in the beginning of the book as ignorant, uncouth, haughty, complacent, and self-forcing, and even a little mean spirited. Towards the end of the book, they became friendly, likeable, and cordial characters, while maintaining the rough essence of a warrior. Bilbo&#8217;s development as a character was enjoyable to observe, and correlated strongly with the Dwarves, something to the effect of dominoes. One change, or action by a character changed, or effected a character in another way. There was really only one thing that I didn&#8217;t enjoy in the novel, or thought could have been better. This thing was the way that some things were explained. Trying to explain some of the subject matter of this novel, while in Old English is no easy task, but the simple solution would&#8217;ve been to write using less sophisticated language, so that the reader would have an easier time comprehending what was at hand. Other than that, this was the only thing that I didn&#8217;t enjoy in the novel.Aside from the perplexing language choice used in this novel, I loved everything about this novel. J.R.R. Tolkien was clearly, thinking critically while developing, and writing this novel. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys fantasy, and questing. J.R.R. Tolkien has another book (The Desolation of Smaug) that is a sequel to The Hobbit, which I most certainly plan on obtaining, and reading, because I loved The Hobbit, and would read it over again several times, if I had the time .", "overall": 5.0}

I am a 7 1/2 and got an 8 just in case these ran small like many designer shoes do.They arrived in the designer box with all of the material to ensure they shipped in perfect condition. Picture does not do justice, they are spectacular. They are a bit difficult to put on because of the tiny buckle and the holes in the strap were not quite wide enough for the pointy thing in the buckle, I forced it in and it was fine. The size 8 I ordered fit my 7 1/2 feet perfectly. The shoes look like jewelry and so versatile they work for business and evening.I did an all day event in Manhattan in these shoes and was surprised my feet were not overly sore like they usually are after 12 hours or so. There is a bit of a cushion for the ball of your foot, if I had foot petals in these I bet I would not have been sore at all. Going to dinner or an event on your feet for a few hours is extremely doable in these and they look fabulous, lots of compliments from men and women. I highly recommend them, just buy one half size bigger than you are .", "overall": 5.0}

{"reviewText": "Fernando Rodriguez @fernrod had the privilege of listening to Peter Kageyama in an interactive workshop sponsored by Leon County, the City of Tallahassee, Village Square and Knight Creative Communities Institute (KCCI). Fernando Rodriguez @fernrod would like to share his insights of the event:Love is a worn-out word. I couldn't count how many times I've heard somebody say, \"I love my triple grande caramel macchiato\" or my wife ask me \"Don't you love how these jeans fit me?\" For those reasons, I was skeptical when I opened the email that read Register to Attend the For the Love of Cities: Tallahassee + Leon County Workshop. I was invited to attend this interactive workshop sponsored by Leon County, the City of Tallahassee, Village Square and Knight Creative Communities Institute (KCCI). The guest speaker was author Peter Kageyama, who has spoken all over the world about bottom up community development and the amazing people that are making change happen.The day of the workshop finally came. As I entered the FSU Alumni Association, I could see a heterogeneous group of men, women, senior citizens and college students, Caucasians, African-Americans, Hispanics and even members of the LBGT community. At my table were other unofficial \"city-makers,\" creative people with a passion for their hometown that want to make it a better place to live and identify ideas that help make things happen.Dressed in jeans and a t-shirt, Peter addressed a captive audience saying, \"A mutual love affair between people and their place is one of the most powerful influences in our lives, yet rarely thought of in terms of a relationship\" as images of museums, playgrounds, bike paths, pedestrian walks and monumental works of art, were projected on the screen.I was familiar with most of these places. I had recently taken my family to New Orleans and visited the National World War II Museum. I have strolled down the pedestrian walk at Times Square and admired Cloud Gate, one of the monumental works of art at Chicago's Millennium Park. Nothing was new, except the term he coined to describe them: love letters from the city.Peter focused our attention to the center of the table. There were easel papers, Post-it-notes, pencils and colored markers. He asked each participant to write what we loved about Tallahassee on a Post-it note, come up to the microphone and share it with everyone. This is when his true gift was revealed: the ability to move people to action.After a few minutes, most of the room eagerly started to make their way to the microphone. One after another, each person filled the room with a sense of pride that I had not felt before. They were saying, \"I love Tallahassee's bike trails,\" \"I love our canopy roads,\" \"I love Tallahassee Community College\" and the anticipated \"I love the Seminoles!!!\"Peter gave us two more assignments: to come up with a design for a Tallahassee t-shirt and to create a new (or revive an old) city ritual or tradition. Again, a long line of volunteers stepped up to the mic and share their \"50 Shades of Trees\" and \"Talla-Happy\" t-shirt designs, among others.The ritual or tradition ideas generated by attendees were as creative. \"Let's bring back the hot air balloon festival\" and \"We suggest closing Tennessee St. and break Bosnia's world record of 1,521 couples dancing in the streets. This would certainly give another meaning to the expression: Tennessee Waltz.\" The audience was energized!That day I learned two valuable lessons. When we consider the emotional connection we have with our cities, we open up new possibilities in community, social and economic development, and love is not a worn-out word after all .", "overall": 5.0}

The box came in fairly decent condition, but the pendants were in perfect shape and they're a good size. I couldn't even see the cast-line for them and all of them seem pretty sturdy to me. You do need to get loops for them because the keyhole (XD) is pretty small, and even if you did find a small chain, they would hang sideways. Even with the task of having to buy loops for them, I think these are still very much worth their price. I've worn all of them once but Diamond Dust, Three Wishes and Oathkeeper (Only because I associate certain days and moods with them and haven't gotten around to those yet). Oh, Spellbinder is the wrong color as shown, it's supposed to be blue, but I actually like it better in red. It almost reminds me of Halloween Town.So overall, these are pretty amazing. I'm often so captivated by them that I just sit and look at them.

{"reviewText": "I've had my eyes set on this necklace for months, just waiting for my birthday to buy it, and then a month afterwards. I finally placed the order and got it shipped on time, in perfect condition. Before ordering, I read some reviews and doubted they were accurate; I didn't believe the piece was so perfect. Now, every time it catches my eye, I spend 20 minutes just staring at it before I eventually put it on and then stare at it some more. The \"drops of blood\" and the red inside the heart are that perfect shade of crimson you wish you could find in a ruby. Also, I find the silver gleam of the necklace to truly stand out, it's so eye catching, and the necklace is a decent size too! Overall, I'm definitely pleased with this. In my opinion, it's a necklace like no other .", "overall": 5.0}
{"reviewText": "This case is really perfect for me. It arrived in 3 business days in a cheap &#34;made in china&#34; wrapping, but the case was much higher in quality than its wrapping. It has a nice, smooth feel and there are no flaws in the stitching. All the holes are perfect in size, my headphone jack can still be easily used, I can access the charger through the case, and the camera's lense isn't obscured or anything by the case. I haven't dropped my iPod Touch yet, but I'm much less paranoid about it falling now (before the case arrived, I kept the loop on my hand and sat directly on my carpet, bed, or other soft surface that wouldn't hurt my device if I dropped it). This case keeps it very secure and I can still hold onto it with the iPod's loop.I got my case in red to match my iPod Touch and I recommend buying cases that match the iPod's color, unless you love purple or orange. I really think the seller had the shades made so that they're like a perfect match, baby pink looks about the same color as a pink iPod Touch 5th gen, and so on. The matching colors of the iPod and case look spectacular! Overall, this is a very nice case with a great feel to it and good protection too! I'm very satisfied with my purchase; this case is everything I could really ask for .", "overall": 5.0}

It is crafted to look like a history book (From the Next Gen era) detailing the events from Cochrine's first warp flight, to Captain Kirk's death (And possibly further, I haven't read through the whole thing yet). It has an introduction by ADMIRAL Hikaru Sulu (Not sure if actually George Takei's voice, I tried to listen closely and honestly, it's a tossup) describing the book and feeling rather honored. It comes with some cool &#34;artifacts,&#34; like a letter from Jim Kirk to his mother and the envelope to a bill that Zephram Cochrane wrote on (His famous, &#34;Where no man has gone before&#34; speech). Perhaps my favorite part is the chapters about the founding of the Federation and the Romulan War. Ya know, the stuff they WOULD have gotten to in season 5 had Star Trek Enterprise not been cancelled RIGHT before it was to start getting really good.

Great season of a great show that ended before it should have.

{"reviewText": "We are in a time and a generation that focus' so much on the self. The desire to discover oneself, or to find oneself, or create oneself is advertised all around us. Which leaves us with the question. &#8220;What if people do not like who I truly am?&#8221; we ask ourselves. So we create a someone that we think everyone will like. As soon as that happens, there is no backing out. We must not only pretend to live that life, but we must make the stories more adventurous; describe ourselves as more free. We are left fighting against our own lies.Lomas describe the ways in which we create ourselves or see ourselves:You&#8217;re a mom. A dad. A child of divorce. A business owner or a freelancer. Male, female, black, white. You&#8217;re an introvert, an extrovert, a person who refuses to be labeled as either. You&#8217;re gay, you&#8217;re straight. You&#8217;re a success, a failure, someone who never lived up to others people&#8217;s expectations, or someone no one ever believed in. you control your own destiny or you cannot seem to escape the labels other people give you (Lomas, 27).He continues&#8230;If you don&#8217;t know the truest thing about yourself, you don&#8217;t know yourself. And that matters. What you believe about yourself determines how you live. We were made for something. Something bigger than the little things we seem fated to surround ourselves with (Lomas, 32-33).So then, what is that &#8220;thing?&#8221; I believe, as does Lomas, that Genesis tells us this quite clearly:So God created man in His own image; He created him in the image of God (Genesis 1:27).We don&#8217;t find our identity. Rather, we receive our identity. We are given it by God (Lomas, 69).Lomas wants his readers to know that the voices that tell you that you are not good enough and that you must create something more unique are not the truest thing about you. In fact most are lies created in your head.The fact is that you are a beloved child of God and He sees nothing but Christ&#8217;s perfection in you. This frees you to be who you are with no fear. You do not need to create yourself. The pressure is gone. You can now live free as the beloved. All those voices evaporate as the Father says &#8220;You are a child of mine.&#8221;  He does not need your acting. No. He just wants you as you are. Fasten the &#8220;Belt of truth around every morning.&#8221; The truth that says you are a child of God and everything pales in comparison.Highly highly recommend this book .", "overall": 4.0}

I purchased it for $98 and I have seen people get it for less.Worked flawlessly out of the box. No need to download codecs..etcCons:Too light, Feels cheap. (The Elgato and HDPVR2 feels better)Does not include any HDMI/Component cables. At $150 retail I would expect it to.The Design. I think the USB should have been in the middle so it doesn't interfere with the output or inputs.Neither the Roxio, Elgato, or the Hauppauge HDPVR2 would display the image as crisp/sharp if I was to bypass the products.HDPVR1 still has better raw recordings than all the external capture cards I have tested so far. Elgato comes in close second with the Roxio and HDPVR2 following.Program randomly stops running after streaming for about 45mins. (This can be fixed in the future)Conclusion: At $100 you really are getting the most bang for your buck. I had a really good experience with the Roxio.

I had seen some quotes from it that seemed so beautiful that I just had to read it -- and there were some great quotes, but they were obscured by the rest of this monstrosity of horrible-ness. The characters are extremely underdeveloped and two-dimensional. Sutter is this raging alcoholic who doesn't feel anything as much as he says he does. I feel like his motto of embracing the now is a total sham, because although he says to live in the moment ten million times, he's just going through the actions. Getting drunk and going to parties and talking to attractive women...this doesn't mean you are always living spectacularly. Not if it means shoving your actual feelings into a deep dark hole and not caring about anyone who loves you. Then there's Aimee, who I feel has so much potential but instead is a character who Sutter simply uses and corrupts. Sutter keeps saying he wants to show Aimee she can be her own person and that she doesn't have to be trodden on by her family, but then Sutter goes ahead and stomps all over her. I didn't like the writing style of Tharp much either. It never quite flowed well for me .", "overall": 1.0}

{"reviewText": "Funny, evocative, inspiring and definitely full of lessons! Don't Forget the soap is a heart-warming recollection about a Filipino family living abroad, and the genuine bond of Filipinos as a tight-knit community. This December, this is the perfect gift to give for the people we cherish!Before I began reading Don't Forget the Soap, my initial impression was, &#34;Oh, this is a book by a well-connected Filipino family. Okay.&#34; I was wrong. The author's family came from humble beginnings, and when I began reading, I couldn't help but smile at the stories that were told within this little gem of a book. I love how the author's family struggled from being the FOB (Fresh Off the Boat) family in a foreign country, and how they made ends meet with what little they had to begin with. This is definitely something I can relate with because my parents started out from very small beginnings as well. This is one Filipino trait that I've always admired - the ability to make ends meet and smile brightly even during the most dire of situations.I also love the stories shared by the author about her mother - truly a woman worthy of love and admiration. She always tries to share with others, no matter what little they have. And I really couldn't forget that piece of wisdom she shared about visiting her older relatives first rather than the more prominent people who wanted to meet her. Seriously, she should be a philosopher or something. She places things into perspective nicely, and I wholeheartedly believe that a lot of people should learn a thing or two from her. Hopefully, this book can help spread her lessons out into the world.While reading the book, the thing that struck a chord the most within me is this quote: &#34;Most graduation keynote addresses have a common message: Do what you love and follow your passion. As inspiring as they are, I can&#8217;t help but think my mother could have a counter speech that might just better serve the majority of those graduating. It would go something like this: Try to find a job where you do what you love but if it doesn&#8217;t happen right away and you have bills to pay, find a job where you&#8217;ll pick up skills and contacts that can be applied to passion projects on the side. You can pursue these at the same time and, who knows, one of them may ultimately lead to your dream job.&#34; This quote struck a chord with me because this is what is exactly what I've been doing right now. I just didn't know it before reading Don't Forget the Soap. Sure, I want to be a lawyer, but I want to be a writer as well. I'm currently working hard to become a lawyer, but I also have book-blogging, which is something I consider as a passion-project. And as a book-blogger, I'm expanding my contacts which I can use when I finally become an author.I also loved reading about the author's Dad. He's one very wise guy, if I may say so. The part where he chose to have his daughter wear something hideous to ward off boys was something I could never forget. It's being protective and it's also brilliant! It had me grinning widely when I was reading it. haha!Personally, I think that a large part of how we turn out as individuals could be attributable to our parents. Sure, we get to decide what happens to our lives, but a large part of our personality depends on how our parents raised us when we were young, so I'd say that parents contribute largely to how we turn out to be in our adulthood. And after reading this book, I have to say that Author Marie Claire Lim Moore is very lucky to have parents like hers. I also couldn't help but be thankful for my parents because I realized how lucky I am to be blessed with such hardworking parents who made a lot of sacrifices just to provide me and my siblings with a decent life.All in all, Don't Forget the Soap is a small treasure hidden within the pages of a book.

And when the story is over, you pick up another book and it is equally as engrossing. There are lots of books like that. But every now and again something else happens. A different kind of book winds up in your hands. You come across one of those rare creations that will completely turn you inside out and tie your heart in a double knot. And when you've finished reading it, it takes a while for you to recover before starting another book. I finished Televenge a few days ago and I can tell you this--I am still recovering. Pam has the ability to string words together that pierces every emotion in the reader. I found myself laughing over the down home southern humor. I found myself heartbroken and shedding tears by the buckets. I found myself afraid of turning the page, not knowing what was on the other side. But turning the page anyway because I couldn't stop reading. I found myself forgetting to breathe. Pam hits the bull's eye with her blunt truths that she brings to the page. The story takes you beyond normal. Beyond intriguing. Beyond stunning. Televenge is one of those rare creations that I live for .", "overall": 5.0}

{"reviewText": "I looked at some reviews and they said the back of the shoe was loose and it was sliding off the back of their heel and I was worried about purchasing the getta pump. I bought it and when I received them in the mail I tried them on immediately! I was so worried that they would be impossible for me to wear cause I broke my foot and some heels really irritate where I broke it. I tried them on and they fit perfectly. The heel was loose when I got them but if you gently squeeze the top of the back of the shoe it will fit more appropriately to your foot. The toe area wasn't tight and was comfortable to stand or walk in  for long periods of time. What surprised me was the amount of cushion in the bottom of the shoe. It had much more than Aldo and Jessica Simpson shoes. With the cushioning, low heel, and hidden platform this shoe would be wonderful for both \"experienced\" heel wearers and beginners. The color is the actual true nude color. Its not too pink or too sand. Its also great you can dress this shoe up or wear it casually. I am so thrilled I bought this Steve madden shoe!! And the cherry on top was the low price I bought them for. The only bad thing about this shoes is if you have really wide feet I could see an issue. I wear an A in shoe width and this shoes fit perfect. I might could see the toe being a little tight if you normally get a C width. It does run true to size. But be aware sometimes your heel size is different than other shoes. I wear a 7.5 in heels but 8 in flats. And i ordered 7.5 and it fit just fine. Overall this is one of the best pair of heels I've bought .", "overall": 5.0}

Secondly, even when that is taken into account, unless the door is very wide, it gets stuck on the piston and doesn't close unless it is pushed, which defeats the purpose. To properly install, I placed them 65mm away from the side of the cabinet and now thy work ok,just they are a bit quicker than the drawer slides and the doors with built in blumotion (which can be a good thing).

{"reviewText": "now here is some terrific horror all right, this one is done by my master king, its already a classic only twenty five years since it came out, i don't even know where to begin praising it so ill just praise it. you see with the right horror like this you have to have a ground of not-horror, you can't have the whole world just horrible like some sneaky writers do because then you don't have any place to feel whats horrifying and whats not. thats what my professor calls the stability factor. you see, if everythings horrifying then nothing is, it just feels all yucky.this ones a good example of how horrors the new great genre like plays were in shakespeares time, back when they wanted poetic words so the bard had to make all his words that way. now kings like my master king don't have to be all showoff that way because they get to you through the real stuff, his talking straight in language you know since you were in the playground, the point is in the eerie world they make. the words arent there to show off what a great word maker he is and get in the way of the story but to open you right into what youre looking at, the characters and all the tension that develops. that's right, the words are like clear windows. now thats literature, thats what peoplell be reading in five centuries, if theyll even talk of hamlet anymore.i wont give away the story anymore than this, ill just say the scariest thing is when you realize these things get into peoples blood through using computers you start to think uh-oh what if this computer im using lets some creatures in through the screen. talking about computer bugs and bots and viruses. but ill just say go get it and flip right through hundred of pages of gripping gripping scared out of your britches but you always come back to where you are in the end and everything is all right .", "overall": 5.0}

{"reviewText": "This is a great product. The casing has a rubbery finish to it which makes it very nice to the touch and easy to hold onto. The iPhone itself is quite slippery so it really helps reduce the chances of dropping the phone. It also adds bulk which can be a pro or a con depending on your preferences, but because I have large hands I like having the extra bulk to hold onto while typing. Best of all it charges your phone on the go. I can go a whole day with extensive use of the mapquest navigation app and even after a whole days' use with the app (probably around 3 hrs of drive time) along with texting and calling I can come home with my iphone still at around 50% battery life. That's just insane. And on the days when I don't use my phone much I end up coming home and the case is barely at 50% meaning I could probably go another full day without a charge.Have yet to drop the phone (knock on wood) but even in the event of a drop the case looks very sturdy and capable of protecting the phone .", "overall": 5.0}

{"reviewText": "this processor is just like the other amd fx chips, it does NOT have a throttling issue! you simply see it go to 1.4ghz if your system is not running any programs, but you can make it 4.0ghz all the time, just change power settings in the bios, ie, cool n quite and the c settings, also change power settings in windows and you should no longer see the \"throttling\"UPDATE. My hard drive is a slow one from 2008. it is bottle necking my system and causing my whole system to perform worse! also my video card is the GTS-250 1GB and may also be slowing things down, all else is up to date.... So when i get a faster harddrive and better video card i will update this to show just how much better this cpu is than the 1055T and fx 6100, as those were my previous AMD processors. but in my opinion if anyone has the 1055T it was what i wish I had and stuck with the whole time. but not getting the 8120 or 8150 was the smart choice i did make! the 1055T was a BEAST but the fx-6100 was the BEST overclocker, got it up to 4.7GHZ @ 6cores and 5GHZ @2 cores. the stock power of the 8350 will make you feel good if you do not have liquid cooling for overclocking. I have liquid cooling and with it you will be happy with any of these processors.stick with the 1055T if you already have itgo with the fx-6100 if you love overclocking and have liquid cooling (and you are a cheap) don't let the stock clock make you think this is better than the 1055T!!!go with the 8350 if you do not already have the 1055T BUT if you want the 8350 and have comfy money for it , get it, ifnact the best amd fx is the 8320 @150 dollars.... but this is a cost ratio, so get the best processor to suit your budget and tech wants.im not an intel guy or amd guy, i am a price guy, and the 8350 hit the spot for me and i have done research with the 3 different CPUs. compare to intel? heck no those cost too much and are not worth the quality increase that is if there is any for real world use anyway! i wish i had known all of what i do now, i would have stuck with the 1055T, and got the 8350 when the price hit around 150 dollars, other wise price per money, get the 8320. my research will save you from spending money on a cpu that does not fit your tech needs, face it, all these cpus do what you will need, but you want to be the next god among your friends with this new cpu purchase!ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW.........The only problem i had with this was it needed a fresh install of windows 7.... saw a huge increase in performance and i am working to make sure i see it the whole time i use this processor, one person somewhere said it was not any better than the 6100, fact is it sometimes performs about the same, but is capable of a lot better performance. Like i say, i just need time to figure what the settings should be. So far, the 6100 hundred cant even perform equal at a full overclock. the 8350 0n stock is a real treat in itself! and the odd thing is how you change no settings only a reboot and the performance drops to the 6100s level. I am seeing this as being the reason why intel fans hate this cpu line as it is not fluent in its highest performance.......... but in the future i am optimistic about .I dont go by benchmarks, i go by what i saw for the programs i was using and how consistent the programs ran each time i booted my computer for a use with unchanged settings.this processor is surely capable of more than what i have, as i have seen its promise even without the hotfix installed as of nowhowever if you are looking to build a cheap pc , go with the 6100, but if you want the best there will be, the 8350 is a great idea . for its cost increase it was easily worth it for me .", "overall": 5.0}
{"reviewText": "I purchased this Maxboost hybrid about 2 weeks ago, after spending hours researching other alternatives. After reading multiple reviews about Mophie which indicated that many suppliers are unwittingly selling fake Mophies, as well as reviews indicating that Mophies have a tendency to break pretty easily, I went with the Maxboost. I wanted something easy to use, lightweight, and reliable. What I love about the Maxboost is that you can take the battery off and leave the shell case on your phone. This is easy to do. The shell case fits perfectly. The case is essentially flat on the front of the phone, so if you are looking for &#34;bumpers&#34; to help prevent damage to the glass surface, keep searching. I hate bumpers because they get dirty around the edges and make it hard to get your phone in/out of your pocket. What I love about this charger is it quickly replenishes a depleted iPhone battery. So, rather than plugging my phone into the wall, I just attach the battery and in less than an hour my phone is charged up. I don't carry mine around all the time very often, but when I do it's great because it looks nice and it fits easily in your hands. It does add a bit of weight to the phone but it's not bothersome to me at all. I have not yet synced my phone with the battery attached so I cannot attest to whether that works, but I have no reason not to think so. All the other reviews indicate syncing is not an issue. I also really like that you can buy different color cases. I will say that the red color I bought is about 3 shades lighter than it appears in the pictures - I wanted a deep, dark red and it's more light red, almost orange in color. Other than that, absolutely no complaints and I definitely recommend this product for anyone on the go, on conference calls all the time (like me) or anyone who travels a lot where you need extra battery life .", "overall": 5.0}

The only problem I have now is keeping the cat from stealing it and hiding it.  She loves it too!  My only complaint, if you could call it that, is that they don't give you a choice of colors.

After the second night, my husband went to investigate and found 2 mice sitting on a hammock in the closet. With me being an animal lover and vegetarian for over 20 yrs, he already knew that there was no way we were going to kill those little guys. I couldn't find any humane traps in the area, so I found this product and decided to try it. We put the traps out and have caught 3 mice in less than 24 hrs. 2 within 30 minutes tonight. I smeared a VERY thin coat (barely visible) of peanut butter in the back of the trap to lure the mice and used banana flavored instant oats for the bait. It worked perfectly! Luckily, we have a park about a mile away where we've released them with some oats. The trap is so simple to use, no need for contact with mice. Negatives to this product are: Its made with very thin plastic, and has small ventilation holes. So they need to be checked often to avoid the mice chewing their way out or suffocating.

The fact that this unit boils water to raise humidity levels make it very inefficient, I found it much more practical to boil water on the stove to humidify my small one bedroom apartment.After about 5 hours of running, I found that this unit only raised the humidity of a small room by 10%, (tested using a mechanical hydrometer)This unit would be good for a small bedroom that is has few or small windows, and very low air flow .", "overall": 2.0}

I'm not trough my 5th lbs and 2nd bottle of vinegar, and i apply it almost every day before going to bed unless i'm too tired to go trough process.I mix 2 spoons of clay and add vinegar until i get a paste in a porcelain bowl (mixing it with fingers you are anyways going to apply it).I apply a layer on my back and even though i thought it's not working after two weeks my acne started to clear (i apply it to my face too just for the heck of it even though i have no face acne). After applying wait 20 min and then jump into shower. this part is messy but it's a shower. I applied it over 30 times and had no problems with the drain. don't try to rub it of just stand under a shower and it will come of in 2-5 minutes. i like to take long showers so after 10 more min there is almost no mud left in the shower. maybe people who force large amount of it had problems with drains but if you let water do the work i'm sure you'll be fine (don't forget that i cover my whole back and i'm 6 3' and 180 pounds)Anyways this works and i would recommend it to everyone that has a back acne problem, just be patient and results will come .", "overall": 5.0}

Because if you become this grandmother, I don't know what mother in their right mind would ever allow you to see her children again.For a normal sane person, this book could be considered hilarious.  But unfortunately, for some (not unlike my MIL) it is dangerous.  If your mother or MIL already have pushy tendencies (i.e. \"I've done this before, never mind that it was 30 years ago, so I must know what I'm doing better than you, move out of my way.)

But this amazing little stuffed animal is so much more than just your average stuffed animal. Around it's front paw you will find a code tag that will allow you to turn this into a virtual pet. You redeem your webkinz on [...]. Once you've redeemed the code you can adopt the pet and print off it's birth certificate which is unique and cool. Now that your pet has been adopted you can decorate the room just the way you want, and when you run out of money (Kinzcash) you can hit the arcade were you can play a ton of insanely fun games. Webkinz are not high maintenance like some other virtual pets. These Webkinz rock!!!!!(look out for cheap imitators) Overall this product is a no brainer buy, especially at this price .", "overall": 5.0}

Now, I am not too rough of the truck, I just drive it up and down the street and pull a few drifts, but the first time I used it, it didn't go very fast, then the ESC (Electric Speed Control) started to smoke out of nowhere, it wasn't even wet. So they sent me a new one and I installed it, but then the axle flew of after going over a bump and I had to send it one again. If that wasn't enough the gears inside the gearbox have become loosened and no longer can turn the wheels all I hear is an annoying motor. Finally the tires are starting to become undone from the rims which are causing a lot of problems while driving. This can is not as great as the claim it to be, I'd get something better.

{"reviewText": "I originally bought this product because what woman out there doesn't like the sound of something that is going to take away from the time spent getting ready, am I right? Unfortunately, this was a terrible idea. I had recently colored my hair a dark burgundy and was in love with the color and the way that my hair was looking, but my local Walmart had the blow dry perfecter on sell and I  just had to try it. I eagerly went home and opened the box up and began to read the instructions. I was a little thrown off by the fact that you had to wear gloves to put this on your hair and that there was, as the booklet stated, \"an odor\" that was more like a stench than anything. I ended up shrugging off these thoughts as I began to imagine not having to re-straighten my hair regularly and applied the first tube to my hair. Twenty minutes later I rinsed it out, while doing so I noticed color was washing out of my hair as well, but I told myself it was only because I had recently colored my hair and it was no big deal so I applied the second tube and I thought everything was just fine. After everything was in I blow dried my hair only to find small pieces of my hair breaking off in the major side bang area of my hair as I brushed it out. This scared the life out of me. I finished it only to find my hair completely fried and the ends. Not only that, my hair color has almost completely left my hair in the area it was fried in, so I don't only have crispy ends, but it is also multicolored and ridiculous and since my hair is in such bad shape I cannot color it again in fear of causing more damage or it simply washing out as it did before. I would never recommend this product to anyone I liked. It is terrible and will do little to nothing for you besides ruin your hair .", "overall": 1.0}

{"reviewText": "I learned of the awesomeness that is french press brewed coffee a while ago (10 months or so?), and purchased a (relatively cheap) french press. It was glass, and it serviced me well until one morning when I went to use it, and found a hairline fracture curving around the bottom of the carafe. I was upset and ordered a new one. This one was also glass, but it was a style I had been eyeing for a while...and...I didn't need a &#34;big&#34; french press as I was the only one drinking coffee. This was a couple of months ago.Earlier this week, I woke up to make my coffee and sadly found my beloved french press sitting in the sink in pieces (it had been on the counter when I went to bed). I'm guessing that wind from the nearby open window knocked it over, but I will, unfortunately never know.Disgruntled and upset and *way* undercaffeinated, I came to Amazon and was delighted to see this french press. I've been considering Le Creuset products anyway, and have plans to replace my pots and pans over time. I am soon to no longer be the only coffee drinker in the house so the size was especially appealing.I love the feel of stability and solidness it has. Wind won't be blowing this over any time soon. I love the rich color (color is good!), and it's nice to have coffee sitting in something that isn't going to get cold all that quickly.I still have to figure out the right ratios of coffee to water to make *my* perfect brew, but I know that will come.

You can put your own type of coffee that you buy. The filter is gold-plated so it does not have that dull nasty taste that other refillable cups tend to have. The coffee still has a strong taste so it does not take away any of its potency. Since you use ground coffee inside the cup, you may get a few little grounds in your coffee. It is not to where they bother me. There are usually just a few and they usually stay on the bottom of the mug. The cup is easy to clean. I wouldn't recommend putting it in the dishwasher since it has small pieces. The top lid is detachable. You need to be very careful with the lid since it is fragile. The latch that keeps the container and the lid together is very thin and can break easily. If broken, it should still work. You would just need to make sure the lid is completely closed when you put it in the coffee machine. I absolutely love this item.

The scarf I've got looks nice but doesn't serve my purpose so I contacted the seller and asked for replacement. The seller was very fast to reply and polite and offered me a refund or replacement. As I realized that the size is too small, having seen them in person, I decided to replace the 4 scarves for one long (I also bought one long scarf from this seller, which is very beautiful and right size). Thank you, T&C; Mall.If you decide to order these scarves, you should be aware that they are small, exactly as advertised 20\" by 20\". It can only once be tied around the neck, if you decide to make a knot, there almost wouldn't be loose ends. It could fit a tiny young girl but not a corpulent lady.  Besides, due to the delicate nature of the silk fabric, there might be some defects in finishing/seams. It absolutely does not apply to that particular scarf I received in a wrong pattern, but some of the others I received, have some imperfections on the corners or edges. But I like all the patterns, it was difficult to choose, they are so original and fresh and they do attract attention .", "overall": 4.0}

Second right after the first wash on her hair i noticed how soft her hair was. She doesn't really have a curl it's more of undefined curls that evolve into an afro when dry. And it gets all hard and dry like I said.  So it being that soft was surprising to me. I went ahead washed it a second time and then conditioned it. The hair was still very soft and when I combed it it was a lot easier then it normally is. I usually have to use a detangling spray but this time I didn't. Styling was a breeze as well n her hair had a shine n moist look to it without me adding anything else. Overall this is a good product for kids. I would recommend it to others.

Each scene was well put together and fun to play with. So many characters are included in this set (you get 3 Luke's) that it makes it more fun.The price was the best compared to any other sellers online who would ship to Australia. (Buying it here would've cost me double!!) Shipping was really fast and came in great condition,my only problem was getting it inside as this set is so heavy!

{"reviewText": "I didn't buy this item on Amazon, but when I buy products I like to check Amazon for customer reviews to make sure I'm not wasting my money. I was pleased that this item was on Amazon, but there were no reviews! Bummer! So... I thought a lot about it, and bought it anyway. I got it for a FANTASTIC deal, cheaper than on the UV nails site and on Amazon, but Amazon does offer a great deal. When I ordered this set, there was no option to choose colors, even though they offer 3 colors along with the kit. In the notes I requested specific colors, when it arrived I was pleasantly surprised that they actually fulfilled my request rather than sending me default basics with the kit. I now just wish I would have spent more time looking at their color selections than just picking a few quickly, thinking they would just send me whatever anyway.Other than that, I'm very satisfied with the product, I just need more personal experience working with gel nail polish, as I am no nail tech. However, I have no other gel nail products/sets to compare this to, but I'm a happy customer.As advice to anyone looking to buy this set, or other products from this vendor, they sell their products cheaper on amazon than they do on their own site. Another reason why I love Amazon! :)EDIT!! As an update to what I previously thought about this set... I thought it was great when I first got it... And not being super familiar with gel sets I thought it was a great deal. However, I think anyone looking to start doing their own gel nails at home, buy a lamp, but avoid this set. The polishes are crap. The first few times I did my nails I thought maybe they were just coming off so fast because I was new to gel nails, but after switching brands and then experimenting with the UV Nails brand products again, I would stay away from their products, even the colors. I still use the lamp, but I've switched to Gelish brand polishes. When using the UV Nails brand polishes, the polish comes off in a few days. It reminds me of when your standard polish is too thick, and after a few days how it just comes off like a rubbery sheet. Don't waste your money, find a cheap lamp on amazon or ebay or where ever, but I totally recomment Gelish when it comes to the polishes and such .", "overall": 1.0}

{"reviewText": "This is a dream product. The CarbonPak is everything an avid camper is looking for. The CarbonPak provides charge for an iPhone 5 about 8 and a half times with its 12000 mAh battery. That's remarkable compared to the IMP50D which charges an iPhone 5 about 3 and a half times with its 5000 mAh battery. The CarbonPak features a dual USB ports at outputs of 1A and 2.1As for phones and tablets. I've used this over weekend camping trips and had plenty of charge left in the device to continue into the next week. What is also great about this device is its automatic shutoff circuit installed into the device. On the IMP50D, to activate charging, you press the button and the lights will turn on and remain on, same with charging, until you press the button to turn it off once again. With the CarbonPak, the lights and charging sequence only remain on for a few seconds. When the circuit senses nothing drawing a charge, it automatically turns off. This saves the battery and makes this device extremely efficient. When my iPhone 5 was plugged into the CarbonPak, and reached 100% and began to trickle charge, the CarbonPak shutoff, automatically preserving the battery of the device, which I think is amazingly efficient and great for plugging my devices in before going to sleep on campouts. Another key feature that I find a great addition compared to the IMP50D, is the way this device charges. This device charges using a standard Micro USB, instead of Mini USB. This makes it easy for me to just plug my CarbonPak right into any of my older phone chargers or even my Android tablet chargers. In size comparison to the IMP50D, the CarbonPak is only a slight bit bigger because of its larger battery. One thing that would be a great addition, would be making this device able to charge using 2 amps input. Overall, I would call this product an absolute beauty and definitely worth the purchase. I gladly give this product 5 stars .", "overall": 5.0}

{"reviewText": "NT80CFor the NT80C, one thing that I noticed, is that it fits into the socket, but feels loose. That I believe has to do with the short, square shaped body. Another thing is that the lights built into the lightning bolts on either side of the charger, aren't very bright. For daylight use, it's hard to see if the plug is active, and at night, it is a soft low light glow that isn't very distracting, but does make it harder to find the USB slots without the use of a separate light. The NT80C has a shorter body compared to the NT88C, which is nice for cars with sockets that are set slightly into the dash. Cars with sockets that are set deeper into the dash, it may make it harder to reach the USB outlets. The NT80C also has a nice \"Y\" shaped design to allow for the plugs to be separated to keep the cables from tangling, but the \"Y\" shaped design becomes almost useless when you have an outlet set deep into the dash and to one side. This makes for the USB closest to the wall of the dash hard to access. This charger puts out a lower charge output of 1 amp per USB, for a combined output of 2.1 Amps. This charger can charge 2 phone simultaneously, but only 1 tablet at a time, and there is a nice information card to let you know this inside the packaging. From what I've seen with this car charger, I give the NT80C a rating of 4 stars.NT88CAs for the NT88C, the body is longer, but feels more sturdy when placed into the outlet. The USB slots are stacked on top of each other, which may make it hard to reach the bottom plug without twisting the charger. It has a nice lighted rim that can be seen in the daytime, as well as not being too bright and too distracting at night. Because of the longer body, it may not fit flush to the dash of some cars, and it could be made slightly shorter so that it can be set flush into the dash. This charger puts out a nice dedicated 1 Amp, and 2.1Amps for quick powerful charging. Combined, it gives you 3.1 Amps of charging power. There was no information card to let you know what it can charge, but based off the specs, I would guess 2 phones simultaneously, and a tablet and a phone simultaneously. I wouldn't recommend charging 2 tablets off of this charger, as it may not handle the power requirements. If an information card were to be included to tell a buyer what could and should be charged off of this charger would be a great addition to the package. Based off of my findings, I give the NT88C a rating of 4 stars.Both the NT80C and NT88C have a stylish look to them, and come with a Micro USB cable for in-car use. So overall for the purchase of both, I give them a combined score of 4 Stars .", "overall": 4.0}

Only one person knows all of the beauty and sorrows of the world, the Giver. And he is about to give that knowledge away to Jonas, the new receiver.

{"reviewText": "Dream vs. RealityDreaming just isn't the same anymore after entering the world of \"Inception.\"  Written and directed by Christopher Nolan, this dream like science-fiction thriller becomes a thought provoking film that will excite any dreamer's mind.  It all becomes possible through the Oscar winning performances, direction, and mind bending illusions in production. Chances are you will have to return for a second run through to grasp the reality of this blockbuster.The life of a professional \"extractor isn't an easy one, especially for Dominick Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio), whose job with the help of advance technology, is to attack the minds of their sleeping targets to extract valuable information.  Each time Dom invades someone's subconscious it seems to take a piece out of him. As Dom's story unfolds you begin to see the pain that he goes through, from the loss of his wife, to the torment of never seeing his kids again.  DiCaprio plays the role with excellence by showing that internal conflict.  That moment is shown when we repeatedly see his two little kids playing in the grass and then running off-screen, without looking back at him and is put into a context, and we realize what that memory is for him. Alongside DiCaprio comes the wisecracking comic relief from Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Tom Hardy as the specialist in the team as well as Ellen Page who plays the role of the architect who creates the environments in which the dreams take place.At some point you have to wonder what was going through Christopher Nolan's mind when he brought forth the idea of \"Inception.\"  Nolan simply wanted to create a movie that allowed the audience to experience the reality of dreams.  The complexity of the film doesn't really begin until the multi-layered plot comes into play.  The \"dream with a dream\" idea shows that Nolan still has the creativity that moviegoers want.  Nolan's plan was to have Cobb complete one final job to plant an idea into someone's mind rather than to take it in order to get home to his children. That is the idea of Inception, and was carefully thought out from an award winning director.  From \"Batman Begins\" to \"The Dark Knight\", Nolan sets to intrigue the audience with another adventurous film.Many will find the movie confusing due to the multi-layered stories that are interlinked.  The production will have moviegoers will have more than an ordinary attention to the film and initially wanted them to keep guessing to have multiple screenings.  With ten years in the making, \"Inception\" gave everyone their own realm of dreams and new ideas for creativity.As I replay the movie in my head trying to grasp of what just happened, the producers got what they wanted.  The ending has us wondering over and over if it was dream or reality, and if it only took one screening to figure it out, bravo to you. The aim of the movie was simple, to create a new world inside one that we each have created when we fall asleep .", "overall": 4.0}

I decided to order a purple mat and when it came to my door I was not disappointed, I got exactly what I thought I was going to get! My zen room at home has really hard floor so I wanted something sturdy yet soft. I have arthritis so I need something to cushion my joints well. I was a bit skeptical when I saw how thin the mat is but when I used it I was amazed at how comfortable it is. It has really good grip so it so it doesn't slide on my floor.I like to do yoga outside too so the carry chord that came with this mat makes transporting my mat easy breezy. The chord is thin but sturdy so it&#8217;s easy to slip on and off the mat and it&#8217;s not bulky or annoying. After yoga in the grass/dirt, this mat is super easy to clean. Just a quick hose down and you&#8217;re good to go.I recommend this yoga mat to anyone who needs one. I absolutely love mine!Namaste .", "overall": 5.0}

I fired about 150 rounds with the light attached and it seemed to hold up to the recoil just fine. When I fired with the light on, It didn't flicker or anything. For 190 lumes the light was brighter than expected and the stobe is pretty awesome too, It will light up my entire front room in pitch black and blind anything you point it at. They can't see you but you see them just fine!If you're a tactical junkie like myself, I think the only down fall to this light is if you wanna holster it with the light attached. Galco makes a universal holster which will be combatable with this light, but I like my Kydex holsters.

My friend's I do security with all have this same flashlight and have had them for a little over a year now. I don't feel mine is as bright at theirs, but this light is still bright.

Compared to the original 3000 series Quartz Luminox, it is a huge step in both quality and function. I used my 3000 series throught a military career and later in the private sector, and it saw great abuse without failure. I can only imagine this more robust design, should be a comfort while getting in some bottom time. So far, time keeping is on par with my higher end watches, just remember, autos have greater variations in accuracy. Nicely sized, with a bezel which should be easy enough to use with gloved hands. The Tritium does not seem as bright as others, but is still always visible. If you desire a watch to get you noticed, I would suggest something else, or even the limited Sea Wolves model, simply because, despite the large size, this is a very low-key watch. I was going to pick up another Tag, Breitling, or Swiss Military 10km model, but I am glad I saved the money and made this purchase.

{"reviewText": "Because this is my first record player, I can not go into the audio specifications or other things that audiophiles and novice Turntable collectors can. What I can tell you is this turntable is aesthetically pleasing and will play your records- nothing more, nothing less.I bought it on impulse. The unique suitcase look attracted me to it, and it looks great in my apartment. Like others have said, the speakers are okay. I am content with them for now because the speakers are loud enough for my tiny apartment, but if you are wanting to play it in a bigger place or for a party, you would probably want to buy some decent speakers.The reason I am not giving this product five stars is because this turntable does have a tendency to skip songs if the bass is too much. I realized that last night when &#34;Limit To Your Love&#34; by James Blake was playing. Towards the middle of the song, when the bass amped up, the record began to skip. I tried to fix this by placing a nickle on the needle, but the vibrations from the needle would knock off the nickle! I'm hoping there's another way to &#34;fix&#34; this problem.

{"reviewText": "I would recommend this product to anyone with fine hair as mine.  My hair has always been sensitive to hair coloring.  After few treatments my hair would start thinning and have a brittleness to it.  As I've gotten older my hair has been even mor sensitive and i had continued to see thinning.  I have tried other semi-color treatments and even semi-color treatment were too strong for my hair.  I finally discovered the Henna color by Surya at my health food and vitamin store and thought I'd try it.  It's been wonderful for my hair!  Not only is it a natural dye but it is a conditioner as well.  I can always depend on my hair having good volume after each treatment due to the conditioning affect.  I use the black cream and as a full disclosure one should not expect your hair to be a true black from this product.  For my hair it comes out to a beautiful rich brown color which I really like (not a fan of black, black hair anway).  I also get an added bonus because the greys in my hair actually turn a reddish color which makes my hair appear as though I have highlights.  I have gotten so many compliments on the color of my hair, i.e. &#34;your highlights are beautiful&#34;.  Some days I explain that it really isn't highlights but the Henna color that I use that has the affect and some days I just say &#34;why thank you!&#34; and don't bother to explain.  In a nutshell this product is great and I do no see the breakage that I had before as it is very gentle and the coverage is very good; comparable to any semi-color that I have ever used .", "overall": 5.0}

{"reviewText": "This CD is as bad as all the other one star reviews indicate. I'd give it negative 100 stars, but that isn't allowed. What pains me the most about it is it's seemingly complete insincerity. We all know Bob Dylan never was a great singer, and now is worse than ever, but that is less painful than what is delivered here. Bob delivers his singing (not too good), along with children's choirs, and arrangements that came straight from my dentist's office. If Bob and/or his producer/s thought that was a good idea, they should have thought some more. A straight production in any of Bob's many styles would have been much better. (Take your pick, straight acoustic, with the Band, Nashville Skyline, etc ...) This mix of Muzak, Christmas, and Dylan makes The Chipmunks Christmas album sound quite appealing, and makes me doubt Dylan's sincerity. This CD sounds like a recording done only to fulfill a contractual obligation, nothing more. I bought this at a library sale for one cent, and it only reaches that value as amusement.

Several times we sat side by side on her sofa while she opened that black scrapbook and shared stories about Raymond.  She was a second-time widow when we met, and often talked about Marvin as well.  He was the father of her four children...a good man; a hard worker.  But theirs was a settled, grown-up kind of love.  Without her ever saying so, I knew Raymond's claim on her heart was permanent.  I felt it when she turned those pages. I heard it when she said his name.  I saw it each Memorial Day at church when she furnished a red-white & blue flower arrangement to grace the piano.  She was still thinking of her soldier.  Nancy allows us to know the young, sometimes giddy Daphne.  Her careful research enables younger women to experience the very different culture of the 40's before television, cell phones, email and Facebook.  It's good for us to know about a time when parents enjoyed respect and good reputations were desired.  Wedding nights celebrated finally the right \"to have and to hold from this day forward\".  Without a blitz of technology, the radio and daily newspaper quietly informed the family.  Letters were read over and over; not deleted.  Daphne's family loved her through her sadness.  The Lord strengthened her and made her a role-model, not only for her peers but all of us.  She was a lady in every sense of the word.  Her story will inspire our children and grandchildren.  We NEED  to cry for the men and women who gave their lives for our country.  I think this book will be around a long, long time .", "overall": 5.0}

{"reviewText": "Set in 1911, this is not a historical novel or a traditional ghost story, but rather a satire of the values of modern China and the interior conflicts caused in the era of globalization.The protagonist Ling Ling, a happy courtesan, seems to have more in common with her modern day counterparts than with the girls of her age. She has an obsession with all things foreign and likes to learn English from her clients.While I was reading this book I was convinced that the writer was trying to convey his experiences in China. Instead of wasting time to create a convincing period setting, he lays on the table the sexual obsessions of the male expat population of South East Asia. Remember that sleazy character portrayed by Russell Crowe in Man With the Iron Fists? All the males in this novel are like that!! But hey, you don't expect much subtlety from a book with a chapter named F******* The Bouncer.After the middle of the novel the heroine finds herself drawn into an affair with a British gentleman who promises to take her to Hong Kong, but she is not really sure if she really wants that. There is also the riddle of the ghost which makes random appearances throughout the story. These parts could have been scarier, the author seems to have knowledge of the Chinese belief system but he fails to utilize these scenes to create some sort of tension. At least there is a bit of deconstruction when it comes to revealing the identity of the ghost. It's not a shadow of the past but rather the other way round.In the final page the writer wraps everything up with a nice little twist which owes to the Resident Evil films.I'm wondering what's the next book Ray plans to write about China. Maybe something along the lines of American Psycho .", "overall": 3.0}

I'm used to reading peer-reviewed journals, so the lack of citations within the text was different for me.The book is very officer-centric.  For instance, the author writes that after one battle, an officer surveyed the dead and injured and saw, &#34;entirely too many Academy rings&#34;;  never mind that most of the dead were, of course, enlisted, and they were dead because of the mistakes that officers made.  For the most part he lays out what the admirals and captains did without judging them.  The US Navy's learning curve was very steep during the Guadalcanal battles.  As an old sailor, it was heartbreaking and maddening to see them make the mistakes they did.There was some Regionalism there too.  He writes about how some of the country folk talked with such thick accents that others (probably meaning officers) couldn't understand them, and that many didn't even know relative bearings (stupid hicks) and the officers had to resort to clock positions to communicate with them.  Of course naval OFFICERS were already using such bearings in the heat of combat, and they still do.  They're called Naval AVIATORS.Several chapters later, he does give some credit to the bravery that these country folks had in combat.  James Webb's &#34;Born Fighting&#34; and several other books are finally giving the &#34;poor white country boy&#34; (AKA redneck, hick, hillbilly etc) some of the credit they deserve for the bravery, toughness, and intellect they naturally have, but the inate bigotry that Horfischer and most of America has towards them was still apparent .", "overall": 4.0}

{"reviewText": "Mod #1I have long arms and legs.  My elbows fall at about my waist line, so I had to can't the holster over as far as it could go in order to quickly draw my gun.  When I withdraw the gun, the indentation on the weaver rail very slightly grabs on the kydex.  I can draw the weapon, but sometimes the holster trys to go with it.  Twisting my wrist as if I'm trying to straighten out the gun as I'm drawing it can maximize the space between the rail and the kydex and stop this from happening. The problem is, I don't know if I will remember to do this if the heat is on.The kydex is too brittle and is secured too tightly to the leather to heat and bend.  Really I think this is a design flaw, and cannot be modified out of any of these types of holsters, unless the kydex goes the full length of the gun.  How I aleviated the problem was to, get ready for this, take a file to the gun.Yup,  I got a coarse file and carefully made one pass at a time across only the distal part, that little nub; testing after each one.  Once I'd filed about 1/2 mm from it (about 1/4 to 1/3 of the entire bulk of the nub), it started clearing w/o a problem.  After that, I took an emory board and smoothed out the rough filed-down part.  There's enough of the \"nub\" left that if I ever use the rail it will work.  You can't even see it.  I suspect that you people with normal skeletons won't have to kick the gun so far over, so it may not snag with you.Mod #2On my particular gun the leather back had to be trimmed a little so the web of my hand would be snug against the \"beaver tail\" of the gun.  These guns are really sweet, but look at them.  The bore axis is already pretty far from the web of your hand already, right?  Well, if the holster keeps you from \"choking up on the bat\", as you first grasp the grip, the bore axis will be even farther out.  Add a 3 inch barrel with some +P ammo, and muzzle flip will be a problem.So, I got some straight tin snips, and just like the other mod, snuck up on it by removing a little bit of the leather at a time until I could grasp the gun with the web of my hand snuggly up against the beaver tail before drawing.  After that I got out the trusty emory board and rounded and smoothed all the edges.Now, when I draw, the gun doesn't snag, and the hand-to-bore axis distance is minimized as much as possible.  I hated to do it, but it was either this or extreme orthopedic surgery .", "overall": 3.0}

{"reviewText": "One of History's saddest events, I mean in the discipline of History, was the premature death of Richard Hofstader.With this book, the last he wrote, not finishing it, he also was making a turn in his writing career. Most of his previous work was analytic social history, more like sociology than what the popular mind may consider as history. Although that work was excellent and he proved himself an accomplished essayist, with this one he proves he has an excellent touch with narrative history. He can still singe right through to the heart of what makes the period studied a period that, whatever our superficial technological guises, we still live in.We have moved past slavery, which was so entrenched in American social structure in 1750. But the persistence with which Americans pursued slavery, as if they perceived it was the only way to build a nation and a new kind of nation, one built purely on self-interest, brings the reader to realize that the nation we live in now remains built on slavery. The vast semi-middle classes and lower classes remain slaves to their debased tastes, their lives must remain empty and out of their will's control so that their master's, the tiny set of property and power holders, may prosper and keep building, all for their own prospering only. At the same time, the masters tell these slaves it is all done for the glory of--back then it was \"God,\" now it is sometimes \"God\" and sometimes everyday mammon.Hofstadter also lets us see the centrality of religion in everyday American life at the same, another factor which has altered only superficially. If America continues to punish the flesh and look to some vague point in the future when God will make everything right, the precedence was there at 1750. If now we seem to live for today, it is not in terms of fully enriching ourselves within the potentials of this world below, but only in terms of momentary indulgences to keep us preoccupied until some dim future when all will be resolved and explained. Candy and candy music are the so-called indulgences, much as prayers and verse-reading were the momentary indulgences to keep the body bearing through this world until the next appeared.Always, Hosftadter reveals, without preaching. The reader can draw the conclusions, even if Hofstadter's brilliant supply of facts leads the careful reader to see the connections between yesterday and today. Considering this book came out four decades ago, it teaches a hard lesson, that the more America thinks it progresses, the more it becomes its same old self .", "overall": 5.0}

I'm sorry but for $10 a book, I'd like a little less sex (I skip right through the sex scenes anyway, I read for the romance, not the sex) and more freaking closure! About 50% of the way through this series, I got so fed up and bored with it that I didn't read it for a couple weeks.

I HIGHLY recommend a drill for this project. I can't imagine how tedious this would have been screwing everything in with a screw driver.

{"reviewText": "i bought this at around 60+ dollars that's why im a bit critical, the store, physical game and packaging, delivery, amazon etc are all good, so don't get me wrong, but after seeing the reviews, id like to add a bit of a counter point for the actual game (gameplay) itself.game is an rpg, you could still play it, but since its all in japanese, you would most likely not get immersed in the story and understand NONE of the dialog, all of which are beautifully voiced, but again in jap so you would just skip through all of it, and i think 30 percent of the enjoyment for the game is supposed to come from the story and the authentic voice acting, which we wont really get to appreciante.30 percent of your enjoyment would probably come from all the VFs that you could pilot, were all macross fans here, you wouldn't even be reading about this review if you weren't, so from VF-0s to the original &#34;made for this game&#34; VF-30, you'll get to collect all the VF that your heart desires-BUT if you've played the PSP macross games like i have, prepared to be disappointed, there's only the VFs here, the PSP games lets you pilot the SDF macross, quarter, frontier, galaxy, seven, vajra, clangclang, and all those other characters, but theres none of that here, you can only get the planes and some zentradi mechs, so it could get boring after a while, not to mention that all planes actually play and moves alike, except for having increasing adjustable points to speed, turning, etc, just like the psp games.40 percent would come from the gameplay itself, ive played the psp games, so thats why its probably not that new to me, but its fun to play your favorite VF, especially on fighter mode, so yeah its okay in regards to this aspect, controls are definitely better to other jap mech titles out there (dynasty warriors gundam, or A.C.E. r) but the missions and settings can get repetitive.to sum up, im not sure if well ever get another macross game after this, so this is probably the best that we have, sad that they already did SO MUCH on the PSP game, and if they could just port those game with better graphics, it would all we'll ever need, but instead we get this. the psp games lets you relieve moments from the tv shows, from catching minmay on your VF-1D, to defending the stage against vajra attackers from that last frontier movie, thats why for me, this game can really get disappointing. hope that the prices could go down, coz its not really worth the premium, just because its the only thing we have .", "overall": 3.0}

I enjoyed that product so much that I immediately knew which brand I was going to buy for my Galaxy S4.  That being said, I did not hesitate to use this screen protector.  I got it in the mail in two days, installed it with no hassle at all, and am enjoying the ultra clear screen protector right now as I'm tapping this review out.  I have, in the past purchased many different brands  of screen protectors for the different smart phones that I have owned and it seemed like they would get scratches in the plastic very quickly.  This brand however does an excellent job withstanding every day pocket use for my phone.  I truly am impressed with this product .", "overall": 5.0}

I don't even feel that I struck my head anywhere (except for the initial grogginess I experienced due to the concussion) even though the force of impact clearly was enough to break this tough helmet into pieces. I was travelling at 20 mph when I crashed (in case anybody thought that it was a passive crash) - this helmet really soaked up the impact and basically saved everything that I had - an impact that can crush the helmet could definitely have crushed the skull without it .", "overall": 5.0}

{"reviewText": "I was looking for a rower for our home gym that was reasonably priced. I have used the Concept 2 rowing machine at workout facilities, but the price was a bit above our budget. So, I did some research and the product write-up of the Phoenix 98900 rower along with the price seemed like a good fit for our needs. The product came packaged ok, no complaints there. Assembly was easy, I had my son assist me and he enjoyed putting it together with me. When it was time to try it, I thought I was operating a meat slicer at a deli! The flywheel seems to be rubbing on something inside the casing. I tried to find the source of the noise, to see where it was making contact and couldn't resolve the issue. One of the reasons I purchased this rower was the fact that it uses magnetic resistance, but it sounds like it is more of a flywheel with a braking system. It sounds like a car driving down the street with work brake pads. I am not satisfied with the product. I would have been better off saving up for a better product .", "overall": 2.0}

{"reviewText": "The knife came fairly sharp, it has great ergonomics, the handle is very grippy, but the sheath is a joke.  I sanded off all the \"protective finish\".  Please, the only reason a primal tool is painted is to conceal defects (knife steel can be blued, but should otherwise be oiled or waxed). I sanded the finger grooves to seamlessly fit up with the grips.  I also sharpened to \"micro convex edge\" and it is now sharp.  The blade is more than adequate for building temporary shelter.  I do not \"baton\" as this is actually latin for, \"I forgot my hatchet/axe\".  If I see another 20-something furiously whacking, slashing, banging, and otherwise pretending to be an Alaskan/Yukon/Outback trapper (while the traffic from the freeway cuts into the commentary), I think I will dirty me diapers.  The sheath is made out of \"genuine imitation ballistic Nylon\".  It is what I would call, \"Ballistic Bedsheet\".  You can't tear it, but if you accidentally cut it, you can rip it right off.  This is what I did, and it revealed the sheath's only real saving grace--a heavy plastic molded sheath/guard underneath that can be easily Kydexed.  If you are careful with the original sheath, it should last a long time.  But if you rip off the \"Ballistic Bedsheet\" and cover the molded plastic guard with Kydex, it will be indestructible, without being outlandishly humongous.  One last thought--a smaller knife, plus a folding saw is much more realistic and probably faster way to build shelter. Yes, I would buy it again.  But, kiddees, quit with the batoning, already .", "overall": 4.0}
{"reviewText": "I received this system today only to be greeted by what was clearly a returned item. The box seal had already been broken, the box was damaged, and the bags that were used to wrap the units inside were torn and opened. The system itself looked ok and free from damage. When I plugged it in it sounded good for about .003 seconds, and then the subwoofers stopped working. The speakers were playing but no bass from the woofers was coming out. I tried the different inputs on it to see if it was my computer, but it failed to play with my pc, phone, and SD card. I could already tell this was a returned item but still had some hope it would work. Instead of bothering with the factory, I'm going to send this back to amazon since I received used defective goods rather than new. I'll do an update on this when the hopefully \"new\" system gets here.I got the new one a few days ago, when I opened the shipping box and saw that the product box also had the original seal broken and replaced I figured it was going to be the same deal all over again. But to my surprise the speakers work just fine. So maybe the factory had to unseal and reseal all the boxes for some reason? Let's hope it was because they forgot to put the remote in, which by the way is pretty useless since it doesn't seem to work when you're more than 5 feet away from the system and has to be directly pointing at it. I have it under my desk so it's no big deal since I can just use the buttons on the system. The speakers themselves sound nice, the subs are loud and make a nice boom. It's a bit overpriced but it makes a nice display.I'm giving it a 3 star from the original 1 star review for the hassle and the seals on the box .", "overall": 3.0}

When I first hooked it up, I noticed that the connection between the twirling base and the hook top was loose, at best, and the plastic that connected them wasn't particularly impressive, but I thought nothing of it. After regular use though, the base began to start falling off, and each time it fell, the subsequent re-connection felt weaker and weaker.It only cost me a dollar though (with shipping) and came from Hong Kong, so I figured it was probably not worth it to pursue the issue of workmanship.Would I buy it again?

The moment I watched its e3 trailer about 2 years ago, it struck my heart to buy it since I am also a total assassin's creed fanboy.Bought it, I like it but some noticeable but tolerable flaws though.  The story was known to be super sloppy and the characters are too inconsistent. Driving is insanely hard if you are used to GTA V's franklin special ability, but you'll get over it real soon by Act 3, assuming if you are playing it consistently and not resuming to play it after a month. gunfights are totally GTA V but again I think its mechanics are the staple of the free-roaming games. Lots of hacking, so many ways to do it and so many ways to use it. If you're a fan of intense games like me,you'll like it, much more heart-wrenching than any of assassin;s creed games while also insanely harder than AC and GTA. There are no stealth missions that I could get through without at least killing 5 guys (or maybe I get frustrated too easily/I'm a psychomaniac/I suck at gaming).Overall, if you really had some crazy a** expectations for this game, you are likely to be disappointed, but hey, try to play it through before you post a review because I was thinking of putting a 2 stars here if I'm reviewing this after only 5 minutes of gameplay. Storywise, it can't match its sister-product assassin's creed but this game sure puts you into a lot of adrenaline and I'm telling you this, there are about 3 villains here that you really wanna strangle in real-life due to their attitudes/personality (something like Vieri de Pazzi in AC2, man I still wanna kick that guy in the nuts)why I mentioned The Last of Us? because imo it is the best game ever made and I hope Sony will approve naughty dogs to release it in other platforms so that other gamers could enjoy it.

All they were selling was the Litter Locker II, so I went ahead and bought it. Th\u0010e first difference, I noticed, was that now it comes with this little ring that dispenses bags. I put this ring in and the main part of the locker filled up over time, but I noticed that the bags kept getting tangled up and clogged with litter. When I would try to fix it by tugging on the bag, the dispenser would feed out. When it came time to empty the bag, the dispenser was spent because of the flaw I just mentioned. I thought I'd give it another shot, so I bought more bags (which aren't exactly cheap), and the same thing happened again.I'm throwing this piece of junk in the garbage. Don't buy it.

{"reviewText": "Ok if your looking at this headphones you might be interested in something that sounds like beats headphones (Loud and lots of bass). This covers the bill and it goes without saying that they are more clear and sound all around better. They are super loud, almost painfully loud with curtain songs and genres, also the bass response is great. There comparable to my Sony MDR-XB500's but of course not that deep but comparable. If you wanted a on ear headphone, in terms of comfort it is what you expect, your ears might start feeling numb or hurting after like 30 or more minutes but if you mess around with the positioning of the cups and things like that you might be able to stand it longer. I expected this so its not a big deal and the sound is worth it. They don't leak that much so its good for using it in public so you won't annoy anyone too bad even on full blast. My only real gripe with the headphones is that they let in a bit of ambient sound in, I mean there loud enough to tune most things out but little sounds will leak in and you might notice it. The construction of the headphone with the indestructible headband is outstanding. There is no creaking or cracking like you get with other headphones made out of cheap plastic. They feel like a premium product. So over all they look great, there made great and the comfort varies but tends to be very good.The sound like I said if your looking for a product that is not flat, that is colorful with lots of bass this is the one.

{"reviewText": "After seeing Devon Franklin on Oprah, I decided to buy Produced by Faith.  During my June vacation on Lake Travis last year, I read the book and it was awesome.  It was just what I needed.  I had not taken a vacation in a few years and this was my chance to get some personal time with God without no distractions.  I was at a point in my life where I was seeing everything falling apart and my dreams were still not accomplished.  Produced by Faith helped me realize that my faith had weaken and I was not spending enough time with God.  I truly was not keeping my Sabbath Day holy.  I was not making God number 1 in my life.  My life was spiraling out of control because I had lost my strong connection with the source.  After reading this book I changed the way I spend my weekends, making sure I get rest, and spend more time reading the Bible and keeping a strong relationship with God.  It has changed my life.  My faith has grown and I am closer in accomplishing my dreams.  This book is an easy read and has some valuable information that will change your life.  I give Produced by Faith five stars, because a year later I still remember what I read in the book and I am still applying several lessons I learned.  So, go get the book, it is well worth it .", "overall": 5.0}

{"reviewText": "I don't review often but this book is definitely worthy of my time.  It's future  transcendentalism was gripping, though sometimes hard to follow.  I loved how it was all from Lukian's point of view.  You get totally caught up in the Hero's angst and his journey of self awareness.  It would have retracted from his drama if the author had suddenly switched to the love interests POV.The action scenes were well done as well.  Actually, they were great surprise.  This book was more Sci-Fi Drama and Action rather than romance.  I was looking for futuristic romance and instead I get this awesome mix of genres that make you think and suck you into a whole new world.  The character development was amazing for Lukian.  Not so much for Naoko, but she was more of a secondary character who was, if not quite essential to the story,  was a great character to further develop Lukian's.The ONLY reason I knocked off a star(I'd only knock off half a star if I could) on my review is because though I found Lukian's mental journey to enlightenment and freedom to be gripping, there were times it ran on and became a bit too much.  Especially at the end where things should have been coming to climactic conclusion.  It was spiritualistic and thought provoking, but it ran on a bit and I found myself impatient to get back to the action.But, in all, this was a great book and I'll definitely be buying more from this author!

The beginning was engaging (actually the WHOLE book was engaging) and the authors world building skill is obviously top notch.  The characters were well developed and their romance wasn't a rushed weird \"your my soul mate\" thing.  Strangely enough, the alien sex wasn't weird either.  And Meoraq is definitely alien.  Which I really like, since most of the Sci/Fi romance books that I've read have the aliens look way too human to be believable. (Usually the only difference has to do with they're penis)I was a little disturbed by the rape scenes, but they were totally believable.  I've read books where authors are too afraid to go there, even if it's the most likely outcome, to progress a story.My only issue I guess was that the whole rape, and all it's emotional side effects, was never actually addressed by Meoraq.  Actually, I felt that a couple things were unresolved.  It was a long book, but I guess it could've been longer!  But then it was one of those books that I just didn't want to end, I was so emotionally invested in the main characters that I didn't want to let them go!  I cried at the end because I wanted it NOT to end!!I don't usually do reviews(I think it's the 2nd one I've done). But I felt I had to express my absolute love of this story!  It's easily my most favorite to date.  Now I'll be comparing all other books to this one! I'm afraid I'll find them all wanting...R. Lee Smith, you've ruined me for all other books under this genre!

{"reviewText": "I run a cat rescue, so we purchased a bunch of these because they are a nice size and the cats like them. We have them in our adoption center, and in a few pet stores where we show our cats for adoption. I have purchased more than 8 of these and I've always noticed that on the top corners of each cage where the two sides meet the top, there is ALWAYS a triangular gap, I believe because the top piece never comes flat the way it should, and the sides don't pop into place (there's nothing to hold them there so the cage often collapses in on itself during setup).. It was never really a problem until yesterday. One of our cats put his paw through the gap, and then it got wedged between the two sides of the cage. He was writhing and screaming at the top of his lungs. There was no way to relieve the pressure because the sides have to push inward to take apart the cage, and that was impossible due to the paw (it would have pulled the rest of his paw back, away from the digits stuck in the cage) It took two people to pull the sides in opposite directions to bend the bars just enough for him to get his paw free.

The lows are solid with out punching a hole in your eardrums. They offer pretty good sound isolation from outside sources though I will say that they do leak a lot of sound as discovered when I tried them at work and my co-workers started bobbing their heads along in time with my music. The removable mic is a nice feature for transport. You should be careful when re-attaching the mic though. It is keyed but it is very easy to misalign it.

{"reviewText": "I purchased this with the thought that it would be a great resource for an extended essay concerning selection bias and the nature of both science and philosophy.  I was thoroughly disappointed.Bostrom attempts to demonstrate the invalidity of a multitude of both uses and interpretations of the Anthropic Principle, generally claiming that whomever he is currently proving wrong is incorrect because he (Bostrom) is going to define the words they used differently.  In other cases his examples simply make no sense (it is obviously reasonable to assume that actually drawing the shortest straw from a stack of 1,048,576 is due to chance, and not due to rigging of the system).He seems to have a general lack of actual understanding of the physics he is dealing with, a view easily obtained with but a little background research.  The language he employs is overly superfluous (just as that was), and at times he sounds like a preppy school boy showing off the language he just learned for the SAT.I will admit that Bostrom had some valid points, but the style of writing and his obvious bias (ironically favoring a multitude of authors (Leslie, van Inwagen, etc.)) made it exceedingly difficult for me to read the book in its entirety, resulting in a very premature abortion of the reading.I believe Bostrom's book is a great example of the effects of selection bias, demonstrating the irrationality that it can lead to and its ability to corrupt even those who are purportedly well-versed in it, and would recommend reading it only to see this phenomena .", "overall": 2.0}

I couldn't help but be amazed and excited. The dice are all in great shape and a pretty equal amount of each dice. I even ended up with one d30! The following is the breakdown of what was enclosed in the package;One complete WizDice set in pouch translucent purple.16-d4  11-d1014-d6  16-d1216-d8  15-d2019-%d  1-d30With the condition of the dice, the speed of delivery and the pretty equal breakup of dice I have no reason to give less than 5 stars. The disappointment in no complete sets is on me. All in all I would buy this again .", "overall": 5.0}

{"reviewText": "W&H is a must have for Greek students. This Greek is a compilation of the oldest Greek manuscripts from the late 3rd and early 4th centuries. Secondly,in contrast to the NA27 which is a compilation of literally hundreds of manuscripts across the centuries by good scholars, it fills a niche of comparisons and good textual criticisms of all texts. Thirdly, it also provides a foundation for comparing the Textus Receptus against the older manuscripts. Finally, the benefit of the W&H Greek Text is to reveal the many Latin transliterations that were imposed upon the KJV. Factually, much of the KJV was rendered not from the Greek but from the meanings of the words from Latin in the Vulgate. Therefore, keen insight can be derived from impartial and accurate analysis from the W&H Greek. Much new and good scholarship has occurred in the last 150 years regarding Koine Greek. I am a 30 year student of Greek since college. I still learn new insights everyday from a strong, Greek study. W&H Greek Text is an asset to any literate reader of Greek .", "overall": 5.0}

I've had it less than a year and I've called technical support at least a dozen times, mostly for the same problem. Less than a month after I got this computer, I started having trouble with the internet connection. I know that it has absolutely nothing to do with my routers because my ipod doesn't have problems and my roommate doesn't have problems, it's this laptop. For a while, every time I put my computer to sleep, it wouldn't connect to the Internet when I woke it back up. I couldn't even get to choose networks, I would click and click on the network button and nothing would happen. The only way I could reconnect to the Internet was restarting the entire thing. I called and called the technical support and they couldn't do a thing about it. They would send my on wild goose chases that always involved restarting my computer and thus call it fixed when it wasn't. I did an entire restore back to factory setting where I had to reinstall all my programs and now the problem happens every ten times I put my laptop to sleep or so. This is such a huge problem for me that it outweighs all the things I like about this computer.I like the touch screen, it's pretty awesome. I have gotten used to Windows 8 and I don't think it is bad. I don't like that there isn't a CD drive on the laptop, so I can't put in any of my DVDs/Blu-Rays or install any of my old games that come from CDs. It's thin and light weight, but I'd give that up for a CD drive. This laptop seemed like it would be incredibly awesome when I bought but I'm honestly going to be in the market for a new one in the next year (And NOT another ASUS).

When the Fast arrived i was SO surprised by how long I could get this thing to sleep. They mean what they say when they say \"Fast.\" I can get this thing to sleep for 2+ minutes. It's crazy, looking at some of these other reviews people are saying it has a \"low sleep time\" but for me it's the exact opposite. With a good throw this thing just keeps spinning for ever and ever it seems. That's the best thing about this yoyo, the sleep time. The material it's made out of is very cheap plastic, not very durable (but good enough for a $10 toy, what do you expect?) It also makes this \"whizzz\" noise when you throw it. Kinda annoying, no big deal though, actually sounds kind of cool. If i'm around anyone and it's annoying them I'll just switch to the velocity.I never use the Mav anymore. Peice o' crap. In all honesty this thing sleeps longer then my velocity. The velocity goes about 45 sec while this goes 2+ minutes. Still, I love the velocity, feels better, plays better, -- the interchangable response to unresponsive on this yo yo sucks. Just keep it responsive, seriously, the whole yo yo will just fall apart if you put it on unresponsive and don't watch out.Pros: - LONG sleep time- Butterfly shape- Good price- Interchangeable from response to - unresponsive - works good.Neutrals: - Not very durable, cheap plastic- Whizz noiseCons - When you put this thing on unresponsive, if you are not carfeful and check every 5 or so throws the whole thing will come apart. Kinda disappointing since I am just now getting into unresponsive play. But that's why I got the velocity... The velocity is much better in this aspect.- Eats through strings faster then other yo-yo's .", "overall": 4.0}

I will say that the hat was really tiny and doesn't just fit on your head and stay there, so you'll have to pin it in your hair with bobby pins but its not a big deal. The other thing is that its veryyyy tight and kinda unforgiving. I wore spandex under mine and you could see the spandex hem through the dress because its so tight. But if you're okay with that I would suggest buying your regular size. I'm like 5'2&#34; and 105 pounds and so I got the extra small. Its tight but I think that's how it's suppose to fit, it still looks good. Also the length was perfect.

Each of the 7 proven marketing strategies are broken down into straightforward steps, making the book an interesting and logical read.You will end up thinking like I did `why didn't I think of that?' so many times.  It really has given me some great ideas, inspiration, for inexpensive ways to have an instant impact on business such as `mobile marketing'.  As we know most people these days have a mobile phone and will read a message `within a 5 minute time period of it being received'.  This access, direct to potential customers is invaluable and the book shows ways of setting this up at a low cost.I found the section on restaurant websites indeed very interesting, the author states, as most people go on a restaurant website to look at a full menu and if there isn't one or your menu is out of date, this could potentially lose you custom.  This is remarkably true, as I know from personally doing this myself!This book in my opinion is invaluable for anyone thinking of starting their own restaurant in today's climate.

{"reviewText": "After seeing a brief review of this book in the paper, I picked out this book for myself (an upper-30-ish-something) because it looked intriguing.  I was not disappointed!  It was a fun, well-written story from page one; one of those stories you just can't stop reading, even as sleep time comes and goes.  I enjoyed the characters, the storyline, and the pace.  My teenagers will love it, and I think my younger kids will like it when they're older.  There are themes and ideas that are not for the younger reader (losing parents, battle, injury), as well as some humor that would best be for the age group it's intended for or above.  I have read books one and two and am anxiously waiting for book three.  The only thing disappointing is that it is only a trilogy, as I will want more!  If you like adventure, magical, interesting, fun or just plain good stories, then you will like this book .", "overall": 5.0}

When you buy this item you are only entitled a 30 day trial to watch movies after which you have to pay another $50 to $60 to continuing using the dvd portion of this product. As I am writing this review the product is currently $30. But it should be explicitly stated that you only have dvd capability for a limited time. Why would that feature not be completely included? They should just tell people the truth that this product is actually $80 - $90 or at least be honest and tell people that certain features need to be unlocked!!!

{"reviewText": "I was given a free copy of this book for review.When I first agreed to read this book I expected that it was about time travel. To an extent it is, but it is mostly actually about a few characters who while well fleshed out, are more than a little implausible in their own ways. For example, Judith, who was a dancer who broke her ankle (but can still dance better than anyone they've ever seen) is as beautiful as a model, doesn't wear a bra in the car (with two guys while on a road trip) and also happens to be a trained racecar driver. P.S. she also loves sports and can win 70k playing Blackjack for four hours.Despite it's implausibilities, the novel strikes me as the early work of an author who will one day be brilliant. The story is great, and the further you read into the book, the better it gets. I guarantee that the first few chapters are the worst. The plot also gets significantly better, and while much of what happens is purely by chance or coincidence, it's well worth the read.The story is quirky and fun, and full of Star Trek references, and the clear statement that Bob Seger is still one of the greats, even in the not-so-distant future where Master's degree students can save up $10,000. It's also filled with action, bacon and eggs, and more Star Trek references.While not perfect, this book comes off as something designed not to be a book, but rather a movie.

It is much smaller and lighter than I expected it to be, which may be a problem for gamers with large hands. The face buttons and triggers have a snappy, responsive tactile feel, and Start/Select were sized and placed intelligently (very small and out of the way, so you'll never press it in a tournament).Regrettably, the directional pad is floaty and not suited for precise movements. It is most similar to an over-sized 360 D-Pad with a wider range of motion and somewhat better accuracy. Grapplers may feel at home churning butter, but the pad will likely slow you down during commands that require more finesse than a shoryuken (e.g. pretzels or pentagrams). Due to its design, it is very likely that the D-Pad will snap off entirely after about a year of intensive use -- or after a handful of bad matches if you tend to abuse your controllers. Handle with care.Compared to my old FC3 Pro, the triggers are considerably better but the D-Pad is surprisingly mediocre. Nevertheless, this pad is one of the better choices in the sub-$30 price range and should be more than enough for entry-level fighting game players .", "overall": 3.0}

{"reviewText": "Ok... So i've been playing with Halo 4 since release date and all I can say is wow! This game is so awesome! I seriously have to juggle work, sleep, and playing! I have read a lot of the reviews and some of the customers getting messed up consoles, sorry about that fellas. As for mine, working like a charm. This is my 1st xbox console, but believe me, I have been searching for the perfect xbox for years. I almost bought the Gears of War 3 limited edition bundle, then decided i'll just get the MW3 limited edition console... Thankfully I waited for this one! :) They are basically the same (the 3 editions mentioned) and only differ with the design. As for the specs, well you should know this by now because if you are reading this review then you must have already thought about buying this beauty.SPECS:- 320 gb hard drive- 2 limited edition Halo 4 transparent controllers with blue lights (and yes, this is different from the \"limited edition\" controller that they are selling outside of this bundleXbox 360 Halo 4 Limited Edition Wireless Controller)- A custom Halo 4 design of the console with transparent casing, also with blue lights, and custom sounds when you power on/off the system and when you open the CD tray- Copy of the standard Halo 4 game- Add-ons found in the box and also if you were able to pre-order this from amazon then they will email you a code for additional armor skinsI WISH IT HAD:- HDMI cable... Although all the other bundles don't come with one either... It would be nice if they include one in addition to the composite cable... Just saying :)- Limited edition Halo 4 game instead of the standard game that's included in the bundle... That way it would be \"limited edition\" in every aspect. I ended up purchasing the map pack from live.Sad thing is it's currently unavailable in amazon right now. If you think you really want this product, then you may have to resort to buying it from your local store or from ebay which we all know would be at least $50 more than the retail price because of the high demand for this bundle. As for the transparent casing, it's not everyone's cup of tea but I like it! So it's really up to you guys if you are willing to shell out extra $$ just to be able to get your hands on this, but if you do, then you won't regret it! :)*** Update ***Looks like it's back in stock! Awesome .", "overall": 5.0}

{"reviewText": "Perfect transaction. My case arrived on time and well packaged. This zerolemon product has more than lived up to the hype. The case fits very snug and is extremely well built. There are no issues with it blocking any of the ports incorrectly. The case does not block the camera at all. The case has its own protective screen which you can pop out if you want but I left mine in and also have one on the phone itself and am having no problems. Its grippy which is good. The battery adds a good bit of weight to an already big phone, but chances are if you already have a note 3, you probably are in it for the performance and not the &#34;cuteness&#34;. Speaking of performance, I am constantly using my phone for videos, games, social media, shopping and sometimes I even use it as a phone! On average I am getting 2-3 days easily out of the phone and with minimal phone use, you could squeek 5-7 days out of it no problem. But, if you are a power user, 2-3 days is what you can expect. Battery charges up from nothing to full in about 4-5 hours. If you want the promise of incredible battery life and don't mind a big phone, then look no further. Cheaper than an Otterbox and triples your battery life .", "overall": 5.0}

I then learned the current batterys do not fit in this unit (it seems to be a touch wider) and the old charger would not work - had to order a new one from Neuton so total for battery replacement was about $140.00.Also not happy that even though mower is stored inside, it has become very faded - no idea why this is when its exposed to the sun for only about an hour a week.I thought about upgrading to the 6.2 model but Neuton really didn't seem very interested in my business.

{"reviewText": "Pros:The Comfort Research XXL in Comfort Suede (Espresso) is a decent bag, and it is certainly XXL.After propping it between a bay window and a coffee table, I was able to get it into a comfortable shape that didn't spread out into a wide, flat, shit-pancake of cheap foam.Not as expensive as a Love Sack.Cons:However, it really is NOT suede. The material is a combination of felt and vinyl, feels soft but pretty artificial and cheeeeeap.Why is it called espresso? It's dark brown (po-tay-to, po-tah-to I guess)When it arrived the zipper that grants you access to the innards of the bag was broken, so it is permanently closed off.This is a problem because after waiting a few days expecting it to fill up to a more full size and shape, the bag remained pretty flaccid.Bottom line, it needs more filling. Filling also feels pretty cheap.Picture of the bag with the girl laying in it is pretty misleading. The bag when unsupported on the sides lays flat in all directions, and rests at about 1-2 feet off the ground. The picture makes it looks like it has a spherical shape. It does NOT!You get what you pay for .", "overall": 3.0}
{"reviewText": "Thick, silky-smoothe, luxurious, and warm(but breathe-able) are just some of the words I'd use to describe this sheet set. Coming complete with a nice, subtle, ruffled detail, the ends of the pillow cases and top sheet really drive home the fact that these are not some s***ty 600 thread count, cotton-pilled, overpriced, designer nonsense you are forced to get in a department store.1500 threads baby. Its simple math, over twice the material and you notice it right quick.This sales lady at Macy's tried to convince me that 1500 compared to 800 thread count(highest they had) doesn't make a difference but she obviously was just trying to get the sale. She failed and I blindly got this instead (glad I did).Taupe - great color and looks exactly as advertised in the picture.

My next thoughts were of handing the book to my dad with that wide-eyed look of conviction and simply saying, &#34;Read this.&#34; Coming just under seven hundred pages, Mr. Zusak has woven together a tale of sorrow, friendship, and discovery, and it is these elements combined with the incredible characters and haunting imagery that make this book a masterpiece. Even the most proficient reader will find themselves needing to just sit back and reflect on what they just read. Although it was a bit difficult to wrap my head around the first few pages, once I got into the rhythm it was easy to see things the way the author wanted you to see them: characters, expressions, colors.Read &#34;The Book Thief.&#34; Read it and don't look back, because once you begin this journey, the only way you will want to go is forward .", "overall": 5.0}

With captivating tales of life, death, and renewal, Mark demonstrates his natural gift for weaving words like a tapestry, and his vivid imagery does not disappoint.If you have never read Mark Venturini's book &#34;Whispers from Forbidden Earth,&#34; then the first short story, &#34;Passing of Things,&#34; will give you unique insight into one of the characters from that book. Indeed, one of the most fascinating things about this story is seeing how the character was before he even met the elf and young boy from Chicago.&#34;If Only to Say Goodbye&#34; was the story that had me on the edge of my seat wondering, &#34;Will he say it? Will he succeed?&#34; It is an impressive feat to create such a story that leaves the reader guessing until the last moment... and then surprises you at the end.A few sweet words, peace for a grieving widow, and one chance to gently calm the sting of guilt. Such is the state of &#34;Away&#34;.&#34;Severed Roots&#34; was probably my favorite story out of the lot, albeit it had moments that made me shiver.

After several days of tweaking settings, messing with drivers, and doing numerous benchtests I came to the conclusion that this card was outperformed by my Nvidia GeForce GT 430 which was released in 2010. If you are a gamer I highly suggest that you put Radeon out of your mind and go for an Nvidia card. Thats what I intend to do as soon as I return this piece and get my money back .", "overall": 1.0}

{"reviewText": "I had been chomping at the bit to do something for some friends of ours because I hate worry without action. So I decided I would cook a few meals for them that I could freeze.Unfortunately, I am a bit scatter-brained when it comes to multi-tasking. So making two lasagnas (one for them, one for us) is a lot for my brain to handle. I had an assembly line going for each pan, and was listening to the Bose using the remote I had on the counter above my workstation.While assembling, I knocked a bunch of stuff off the top counter (including the Bose remote) and onto the floor. Picked it all up, or so I thought, and then covered both lasagnas with tin foil and put them in to bake.While they were baking, I realized that I couldn't find the Bose remote. I looked everywhere; even searched the trashcan three times.When the oven timer went off, I stopped my frantic search to remove the tin foil from both pans..and VOILA!There was the remote, lying on top of one of the lasagnas. Face down, cooked for 30 minutes at 350 degrees.And what do you know - the remote still works! THANK YOU BOSE FOR MAKING A FOOL-PROOF PRODUCT .", "overall": 5.0}

He's her favorite player. She wears his number, his jersey and has his pictures on her wall!Elli is beautiful, shy, funny, successful, caring and a size 10! She thinks she is average, over weight, and nothing special.She is gorgeous, famous and a ladies man. He is also goofy, wears glasses, loves kids and his family.Elli is nothing like the women he usually \"dates\" but he falls for her and he falls hard!This story was awesome. I loved what a great bond Shea had with his sister and his family. They were sweet and funny. Shea was amazing! So sweet, thoughtful and loving. Very swoon worthy!!Elli's family (not all) was terrible and their antics were just heart breaking.Elli was so insecure and unsure of herself. I felt awful for her.

There were many, but they all made the story worth while.Now, onto the grammar and editing. OMG terrible!! The misuse of your and you're as well as then and than just killed me!

As a matter of fact I was expecting it!!How did I get so lucky to receive an advanced copy?? Bless you A.L. Jackson!Come to Me Quietly is a beautifully written story of friends turned lovers.This story is filled with tenderness, heartbreak and love.Told in dual pov (which is the best), mostly told in the present tense with flashbacks to when they were kids.With the flashbacks, you get a glimpse at the sweet and innocent boy Jared once was. He was always taking care of Aly, watching over her and loving her. I LOVED the way he would hold onto a piece of her hair!! So sweet!Jared now is a broken and damaged man. He isn&#8217;t worthy of love, friendship, trust or even a happy life. At least that&#8217;s how he sees himself. He is in purgatory and must pay for his sins!Aly is beautiful, sweet and pure. She embodies everything he cannot have. She also reminds him every day of his past life. How it felt to be loved, happy and carefree.He struggles with his feelings, wanting her and knowing there's no way in hell he can have her.Despite the shocking tragedies and tortured character, I found the story sweet and easy going. The shock and tears came much later in the story, almost at the end. That's when she hits you with it all at once!Not a cliffhanger per say... but you are sort of left hangin'!Can't wait to find out where the journey leads in Come to Me Softly.*I received an advanced copy provided by A.L.

{"reviewText": "3 starsSo I'm on the fence about this one. Most of the time I enjoyed it, but I was left feeling stumped. Did I like it, or not?This started out your typical student/teacher romance but it didn't quite have that forbidden feel to it as others I've read. Both Ryan and Kate have old issues that hinder their feelings and actions.I really liked Ryan's Raven which was told before the story started, in Ryan's pov. It was funny and sad.Ryan in the beginning seems like a bit of an arrogant ass, but because of his past seems a bit justified. Throughout the story he shows his kinder caring side and I liked him a lot.Kate is a bit of a contradiction and seems wishy washy. On one hand she's strong and independent, a real \"don't take no shit from anyone\" kind of girl but then on the other she's nave and too trusting of others.I enjoyed the flirtation between Kate and Ryan in the beginning. Also, I especially liked Carter and Dean's antics. They brought some good humor to the story.Once Kate and Ryan got together, it seemed they jumped right into a relationship and the author skipped over their getting to know each other phase. It also sometimes felt rushed, especially the ending.A couple of shocking moments took place that I so was not expecting. One in particular was a complete betrayal, but then it seemed as though the characters just brushed it off as nothing happened and then it zoomed right to the end to a HEA!? Really? I mean, I wanted a happy ending, but I needed a little more. That's where the wishy washy came back into play.It was a good story with parts that I liked, but also parts that didn't make sense. Now I feel like my review is one big contradiction!You also get a sneak peak into the next book. WTH? I really liked Ryan in Preservation but am not sure if I like what I read in Reservation.

I LOVED Tall, Tatted and Tempting! Logan is beautiful, sexy, tender, loving, tatted, and deaf!! I have not read a romance story where the hero had an imparement and I SO love him. He was strong and confident, but sensitive and vulnerable.He would always touch her, he could feel the vibration in her throat when she'd make noises or speak, look at her face to face to read her lips and see her emotions!! UGH it was so intimate!The writing was beautiful!Kit (Emily) was hiding something, and I was thinking up the craziest scenarios. Probably because she said she \"wasn't free\" and after having reads several slave related books I thought \"oh my gosh\", did I miss that in the synopsis?? But she wasn't a slave, at least, not like that.Kit was a very well rounded character. She was strong, talented, not a slut or a virgin, she clearly needed help but wasn't the usual damsel in distress. And I loved that she also had somewhat of a disability. The interactions between her and Haley were adorable and sweet.Matt!! UGH! It brought tears to my eyes!!!!There's SO much emotion in this book that I don't know if I can get it all out.It was funny, sexy, sweet, sad, loving, etc etc etc!!The brothers!!!

WHAT?? It wasn't even a week!! Needless to say, she goes from being a naive virgin to not!! I know she was exploring and all, but maybe a little too much information about what his junk looks like? Maybe it was just me.There's really not much about the stripping.. not much about her in school either..Then it LEAPS to the future, without warning, and turns into a porno! Well, not really, but kind of gets a little boring and is just about sex, then more sex and sex again. Not too much story really. Then it was over. :(I was a little disappointed, but then again, everyone has their own opinion and you might love it .", "overall": 3.0}

The book flowed nicely and was written well, it was just different.Awkward, nerdy freshman Samantha gets somewhat obsessed with hot, popular junior Delaney. I wasn't happy about a lot of Samantha and Delaney's interactions especially the way he treated her at school. Their relationship was just odd.It's also about Samantha's parents and their past love triangle. They end up introducing Samantha's biological father/third party of their triangle into her life.I found Samantha's family dynamic to be very refreshing. They are very open with their daughters, never shying away from discussing embarrassing or awkward topics.

She ends up contacting her brother's best friend Will (bad boy/player/pussy expert)and deciding he'd be the perfect person to teach her how to date a.k.a. get laid!Ok, this is where she goes from being an outspoken intelligent woman to being a nave imbecile.

Well, most of it was good.. but with a little less info and a bit more emotion and follow thru, it could have been awesome.Tragedy strikes at the very beginning. The story starts with a teenage Erin being dealt a harsh hand. We resume the story five years later when Erin and Alek meet for the first time.Alek Dostov is a Russian/American child prodigy and Maestro at just 23. Erin Angelo is now a 21 year old American, up and coming clothing designer living and working in Milan.They both come with a lot of baggage and secrets.The story was filled with sexual tension, intrigue, danger, humor, and love. There was also an array of talent. (musicians, dancers, singers, artists, designers.... and Erin, could do it all)Unfortunately, it was all a bit muted for me.Cities and places around Italy were mentioned.. Florence, Milan, Capri, Lake Como, La Scala, the Galleria, the Duomo. I have been to all these places several times and was excited to read about them.. but there wasn't that much info about them. (felt like it was just name droppin)As far as story lines and characters, I felt like there were just too many with way too much unnecessary information. There was also an excessive amount of twists and turns trying to make it more interesting... but sometimes less is more.When everyone's secrets were finally revealed, they didn't exactly pack the punch I was waiting for.No tears and no big gasps from me.Maybe if the characters had reacted with more emotion after learning certain, pretty big secrets.. it would have drawn out more emotion from me. It was kind of like, \"oh really? you killed my best friend, ok, no biggy, I can get passed it!\" WHAT?? That is NOT a quote by any means.. just giving an example!I did enjoy the his and hers pov.The ending was supposed to be a HEA but felt like a HFN. Alek's words at the end of the Epilogue had me feeling like he was more unsure at the end than he was at the beginning.

Along the way she has family, friends and her boyfriend Cameron who love and try to help her.. but it's of no use.The story and characters were very realistic and I was moved by the overall message of the book.I was very happy with Cameron.

I have tried some of the same tricks. I know about the chewing gum, green tea and laxatives. Fortunately for me, I had never gone to the extremes that Kayla did.

From the beginning, I felt so sorry for Cadence. She was so sad and alone. I can't imagine having to go thru all the terrible pranks and harsh words from her fellow classmates.At the same time, it was pretty darn funny. Most of the time it was Cadence's thinking that was pretty sarcastic, not to mention her friend Avery that had me laughing out loud.Avery was just plain hilarious!Then comes Mark Connelly.At times he seemed so young and cool.

Then something would happen or in something he would say, made me cringe and think OMG he is an almost 30 year old man!!My emotions were changing from page to page.

Mason does what he does for his family, not because he enjoys it. His younger sister Sarah has Cerebral Palsy and is confined to a wheelchair. He needs the money to not only pay for his college, but his sister's and mother's bills.There's also a hint of the unknown/of danger lurking... with Reese's ex on the loose and possibly after her.Throughout there's sweet and sexy banter between Reese and Mason, as they attempt a friendship while trying to avoid their attraction and the fact that he is in fact a gigolo.You also see a sweet and loving Mason with his sister Sarah.The reason for the 3 stars only is because towards the end, it got a little cheesy maybe?

Like, race to the finish, go out with a bang!The cousin, the ex, the landlady... rolled up with a HEA and what you hoped would happen of course, but it just kind of seemed a little far fetched and like I said, cheesy.

Hot, smart, funny, charming, did I say hot? Wes was so grounded and wise for someone in his predicament. Also, there were some very enlightening words of wisdom.I thought there would be more about Kiersten. Maybe a little darker of a story/past, but there wasn't anything too dramatic about her.I found the story to be very.... clean/pure I guess I would say. Not much cursing if any at all and no sex.

The synopsis sounded intriguing.. but led me to believe this would be a bit of a darker read. James McKay is a drug dealer! Mystery, secrets, overdose, meth making... but it wasn't.The story was rather sweet, easy going, and funny.At times though, I found it a little slow. Other times, there was a lot of rambling.. very descriptive.. about meth making!! How to make it, what meds to buy, what the chemicals do to your body, how to counteract the reactions and side effects.Throughout I was enjoying the light read, very YA, even with the meth. I kept thinking, Ok.. this is cute and it's sweet, but nothing WOW, how was I going to rate it? Then I got to the end and BOOM!!! The ending. WTF??? Are you serious?? I cried and cried! I was shocked!I enjoyed the closeness of the twins Hadley and Simon.Hadley was funny and sarcastic. The interactions with \"Dog\" were very sweet and loving.I felt bad for James. He'd been making meth since he was 14 and figured staying away from people and friends was the best way to not let on about his meth making. In doing so, he's alienated himself from everybody. He was lonely.I'm not happy with how it ended, so I can't say that I loved the book. Like I said, it was a light easy going read until the end and then I was way too distraught by the shock .", "overall": 3.0}

The next couple of bites are just as tasty. Halfway through you feel sick to your stomach, slightly disgusted and don't think you can handle anymore.. yet you press on. Once you've devoured the very last bite you push back from the table with just enough energy to rub your satisfied belly and smile!Fortunately if you like happy endings.. this one ends the way it starts.. funny, steamy and raunchy .", "overall": 4.0}

She is \"sleep running\" as she calls it. She suffered a great tragedy and is now simply existing, rather than living... that is until the day she meets Dr. Chase Colton.And Dr. Chase Colton aka Dr. Sexy, Dr. Possessive, Dr. Intensity, Dr. Compassionate, Dr. Orgasm... is one hot ass alpha male surgeon! mm mm mmChase is also holding back from really living. He harbors great guilt for his past mistakes and there was absolutely nothing anybody could do to change him ..... until Lili came along.Another reviewer mentioned Grey's Anatomy. It's true! You do get a Grey's Anatomy/ER feel, especially in the beginning.Loved...Chase is very possessive and protective.. and SO HOT!There are several supporting characters, friends and family whom all added great humor and drama.Sierra's pregnancy woes had me rolling on the floor laughing!!Chase's family secrets and pain caused me just that, pain. How utterly heart-breaking! And the Epilogue!!! HOLY CRAP, this is where I did most of the crying!!!Not so much love...Some of it was a little repetitive. Asspuck! Ok, that was funny.. but it was the only word they used, over and over!Also the use of \"truth\". The first couple of times it was sweet, then after the 50th \"truth\" all I could see was The Kardashians saying Bible!Speaking of all things Kardashian.. Guy sure liked using the term \"Doll\"!! (but that I liked)And finally.... Blue! I can't get over the nickname. I get it, it's her eyes.. yes, yes, sweet.. but really?

Emma was a touch annoying. Teresa was quite annoying and the whole Teresa and Noah thing?? We just getting buttered up for their book?? That's what it felt like.From the very beginning I wasn't happy. The synopsis already tells you that she walks in on her roommate being raped by her boyfriend. No spoiler there.

Only this time there's a little more than just friendship going on.I love the possessiveness and jealousy they both felt.\"You touch me again, and you won't have a choice. You'll me mine.\"There's also some purty hot moments!!-Coop watched as Noah's chest and stomach heaved in and out with laughter. Eyed the bar piercing through his nipples. And Jesus... wondered how they would feel against his tongue. What it would be like to run his hand over Noah's firm muscles.-But for some reason the use of the word \"man\" just felt weird to me. I know men use it all the time, like the words \"buddy\" or \"dude\", and that's all fine and dandy most of the time, but during sex or foreplay?

Oh and instead of him getting her a puppy, he finds kittens! Ok, so there's a few things.. but it ends there, trust me!

I could take or leave her. There was also too much dialogue with Lorrie's aunt which just didn't do anything for the story, and way too much emphasis on the damn kittens...Yes yes, cute little kitties... but Hunter was a big bad womanizing fighter for all of two seconds, then suddenly turns to mush over kittens??Ok, lets talk about something else... sex! So about 65ish% in, the sex comes into play and that's when I had to laugh! OMG, first of all, they go from not even flirting a little bit to downright marathon f***ing!

Ok... worked for me!!Ty and Zane are both (hot) FBI angents assigned as partners on a serial murder case. They couldn't be more opposite from each other. One's clean cut, polite and by the book while the other is rugged, unpredictable and unrestrained.They had amazing chemistry from bickering partners to forbidden lovers.There were a few HOT moments and also some very sweet and emotional ones as well.- he leaned back against the counter and reached out to slide the ends of his fingers into the front of the waistband of Ty's jeans and tug him forward.mmmm that's when it started!Some readers say the use of &#34;baby&#34; is overused in many books, but I still LOVE it!- &#34;Please....baby,&#34; Zane's voice cracked with agony as he pleaded between uneven gasping breaths. &#34;Get out of the car&#34;UGH you could feel his agony and love!!Can't wait to read the next book .", "overall": 4.0}

It was interesting actually.A couple parts of the story were a little gruesome, with all the talk of \"blood splatter\" and \"brain and bone matter\". yuck But that was only part of the story.The rest is about Jack. He has a secret he keeps from everyone, except his closest handful of friends some of which also happen to be his co-workers.This secret, regarding his first love Nick, is brought to the surface when he gets a phone call informing him of Nick's suicide.Attempting to bid for the suicide clean up job, Jack meets Ryan..

He craves love and companionship, but he also fears it.He overcame such  tragedy not just once, with what happened in high school, but twice, with his accident. Going from a rough and tough fireman to living with a knee replacement, constant pain and scars.This story is about loss and love, but also about the problems the characters face with their homosexuality (whether it's being ostracized from family, being bullied and beated or afraid of coming out to others).It isn't all sadness and gloom though. Jack and his friends have a great brotherhood/bond that is present throughout. I enjoyed the other characters as well and can see future books!

Definitely a \"Sex in the City\" type story.Taddy praying to \"sweet baby Jesus\" in the club when she spots Warner, hilarious!This is ultimately the story of Taddy, a self-made millionaire with intimacy issues and Warner, a hot and confident billionaire.

They are gorgeous, talented and passionate, they sing and play instruments. ..... and there's three of them!!! Can you say more books?? Yes please!The story is told in both his and her pov, which I LOVED! Her version has you thinking he's a total bad ass, while his divulges his tenderness and raw emotions. Still being a bad ass of course.There was SO much going on in this story: lots of characters, many story lines, several twists, humor, sadness, mystery.  Most of it I really liked and some of it was just a little unlikely. Not very believable and that's what had me not falling over in love with it.There's mystery and suspense. She's hiding secrets that keep getting hinted at.  One of them was easy to figure out. There's also sweetness and caring. Booker has been in love with Aubree since he first saw her. He's protective of her and that makes him SO hot! There's chemistry and passion, but it's not over the top explicit.  You also learn about her friends and his brothers. Everyone has their own story and their own secrets to hide.You also get a little taste of Louisiana... not to mention small town life. There's frog giggin, Cajun cookin, fiddle playin, and lots of everyone in your business and gossiping!The few things that turned me off a bit or that just didn't seem right were the Outlaw triplet's age.  Booker was a huge success, cars, money, houses and only 19. Roughly 9 months out of high school. Also, the Aunt/momma story towards the end was a little out of left field.

{"reviewText": "Broken Beauty is a short novella and the first in a series of six. I loved this emotional story and couldn't put it down.This is the story of a young girl named Mia who is brutally raped at a party by two men, one of which she knows.I was drawn in from the very beginning when she awakened after the rape. It was just heartbreaking. The events that followed had me going thru a range of emotions. I felt sadness one moment and anger the next. The love and support from Mia's family was nonexistent.  Her politician father seemed to care more about his campaign and reputation than he did for his own daughter.  He didn't even come to the hospital after having learned of his daughter's rape.Luckily Mia did have her best friend Ari by her side and the support of Dom, one of the police officers that found her. Dom is handsome, kind and makes her feel safe.I liked how even thru all the pain and anguish, Mia was still thinking sarcastic and funny thoughts. The added humor was just enough to not have me bawling my eyes out.This is an eye opening account of the hardships a victim goes thru. You're with her for the aftermath, thru the nightmares she remembers from that night to the new nightmares she lives during the day. She's afraid they'll find her again. She's afraid of crowds, noises, and even open spaces.  The guilt she feels. Was it her fault? Did she bring it on herself?  It truly is an emotional story.This first installment in the series is not a romance. This solely is about Mia, the rape and aftermath. Although the author does an excellent job at giving details about that night, there is not a graphic/vulgar description of the actual rape. Don't be afraid to read it.Also, the hope of a future with Dom lingers in the air. I can feel it! I'm a sucker for romance and happy endings. I look forward to the next novella in the series and pray that happier moments are in store for Mia.

I mean coke!&#34;That part, among a few others, was a little heavy on the cheese!And Boo?? BOO?I really liked her character.... her name, not so much!Ok, now that that is out of the way... I really did like this story!! hahaLily meets Nox in an unconventional way.... when he kidnaps her! Or does he?? This instantly ignites a love/hate relationship.Lily is a virgin. In every way you can be!!She's also sassy, spunky, curious and unknowingly beautiful.Nox is rugged, unemotional, handsome and somewhat detached. Until Lily of course!Kidnapping, blackmail, explosions, death... this story has all of that, but it's not gritty and suspenseful. Instead it's light and funny.Some parts are a tad silly and others pretty damn funny. There also comes a moment of sadness and pain to which I actually got teary eyed!There's love and sweetness and sex! Not crazy hot monkey sex, but some sex nonetheless!I enjoyed all the characters, including Rock and Boo. They were funny, sweet and had a great relationship.At times Lily annoyed me, but I got over it.SO.... I really did enjoy this book and regardless of the placement of silly and totally ridiculous words, I shall read more from Belle Aurora .", "overall": 4.0}
{"reviewText": "I was intrigued and very excited to read a story where the heroine is a bad-ass female assassin!&#34;Bullet&#34; is just that, cold, calculated, hard as nails, emotionless, fearless.. and a killer.She was bred to be. She and her sisters (fellow assassins) were stripped of their childhood and ergo a normal life and instead trained/tortured into becoming the women they are today.Bullet's story is packed with action, intrigue and suspense. Bullet is definitely a kick-ass, strong-willed heroine. I loved her!Add a leading man, Rand Beckett and you have scorching hot chemistry mixed with hatred and lust! Some very hot moments I tell you!Put those together with a gut-wrenching tale of torture and pain and there you have Bullet to the Heart.Hot and steamy, yes.. action packed, yes... sad and tortured tale, yes.. but throughout it all I was left wanting more.Her story although incredibly emotional and sad did not bring me to tears. :( I wanted tears! The addition of Russian and French phrases was awesome... but I don't speak either and had no clue what they were saying! (the translations are in the back of the book, which I found out after I read the story) :(It also ended a little abruptly for me. I was happy and not so much with the end. Seeing as how my Kindle said I was only at 82% I was anticipating more! I had quite a big WTF? moment. Not a cliffhanger mind you... just an open ended story leaving room for the next assassin to tell hers .", "overall": 3.0}

You immediately fall in love with her for her strength and bravery. She is also kind, gentle and caring.Cue Kade. Talk about tall dark and handsome!! He is also unbelievably arrogant, disturbing and quite frankly an a**hole!Kade has a vivid and gruesome imagination, which makes him an excellent horror writer. Unfortunately his thoughts all stem from a horrid event from his childhood which has changed him forever.The two have a sort of love/hate relationship. What is it about him that she can&#8217;t stop thinking about him? His eyes, the way he watches her, his intensity.And there's just something about her that has him bewitched. He can&#8217;t think, he can&#8217;t write, he&#8217;s mesmerized by her.This isn't all about being dark, creepy and suspenseful.... it's actually quite funny, sexy as hell and a touch emotional.Can't wait to read more .", "overall": 4.0}

{"reviewText": "This book is simply wonderful. As far as the stories it contains are concerned, I have absolutely no complaints. Lovecraft's vocabulary is something to behold, providing even the most learned readers with at least a few unfamiliar words. Lovecraft has a skill not just for storytelling, but also for setting up a dark and frightening atmosphere for his stories. Anyone who is unfamiliar with Lovecraft's work ought to pick this item up; it serves as a nice sample of the kinds of works that Lovecraft is known for, and it will take quite some time to get through the entire 800 pages so one gets his/her money's worth for sure. The only reason that this item does not get a full five stars from me is that while the contents of the book are phenomenal (though appear to have been edited by a Brit due to spelling variations), the book itself physically leaves much to be desired. The ink of the text tends to smear if one has sweaty hands; further, the ink on the outside cover fades away too if one's hands sweat profusely. The book is also gigantic. To purchase this item is to purchase not only a source of entertainment but also a source of security; this book is big enough to be brandished as a weapon.

{"reviewText": "I have been doing research on cassette-auxiliary cord adapters for quite a while, and the number of good reviews are often matched or surpassed by the number of bad reviews. Given this fact, I purchased this device without high expectations; however, upon first using this product, I was significantly shocked by its quality. It took my cassette deck a view tries to learn to not spit the faux tape out before being told to, but once my player grew accustomed to having the cassette door slightly ajar, that was no longer an issue (and upon reading the instructions provided with the device, this is apparently a normal symptom of first use). As far as the sound quality complaints that the reviews of some of these types of devices seem rife with, this device is obviously not going to have as high of sound quality as, say, a set of classy (and pricey) headphones; but in my opinion, the sound quality of this device is high enough to get the job done. I would highly recommend this product to anyone who has only a cassette deck to work with in his car and is in need of some modern tunes .", "overall": 5.0}

Helen's reaction to the \"inappropriate\" situation at the resort was perfect, a perfect balance of fear and excitement, a famous minister's wife struggling with doubts and temptations. And Greta, strutting and fretting her hour upon the stage, resonated with my own life. And Sam, so vulnerable with his imperfections and his obsessions, was fascinating because, as much as he denied it, destiny did seem to be working in his life. The author kept going deeper into the character's lives, revealing more with each page, yet always building the tension toward the surprise ending. Nine Days was a complex story with a lot of layers, vivid descriptions and plot twists, yet it was so easy to read. It was just what this Illinois art teacher needed to read on a snow day!

Another way to make it last longer is not to clean your shaver after every use, but rather just once or twice a week. In between cleanings, or before extended absences, I pull out the refill cartridge and seal it to keep the fluid from evaporating while it is just sitting there.

{"reviewText": "The disintegration of Futh's marriage at first seems like just another very sad statistic in matrimony, until we see that it's perhaps Futh's slightly simple nature, social clumsiness and 'round peg in a square hole' temperament which may have contributed. As the character is built, his clumsiness becomes very plausible and when combined with the constant awareness which haunts him of his own mother's leaving his father, I couldn't help feeling as weighted down as he must have been by a cruel fate - if not cruel genes.On flashback to his ambles through Germany with his father, soon after the splitting of his parents, all he has to cling to of his mother through to his rather humdrum middle age is the model lighthouse she gave him as a child, a perfume container, which he hopes may one day give him a glimpse of better luck in his life.For me it was the way life still cheated him, the way early embitterments in life can cast a permanent cloud over any future, that made me sympathise so deeply with Futh. However, the tone of the book is often so interminably loaded with cloud that the cumulative effect is almost depressing. Perhaps this is the success of the book but, to an extent, that success eluded me .", "overall": 3.0}

I was drawn to the character of the the gentle teacher who is humiliated by those who mentally trample him under foot instead of listening to his teaching on the metaphysical poets. From the start, even though Matt Kreasey's paranoia seems at first a little unfounded because you don't know whether his demons or class tormentors really are intending to harm him, still the tenderness of Kreasey's feelings for his young student, Amy, were raw and effective.Amy becomes her teacher's only ally when he has to confront the pack of wolves who are his students. Yet the tenderness and the promise even of love is so often strained by the lingering air of menace which runs through this book.The writing rises at times to poetry and descends where it needs, to street slang. To begin with, something of a slow burner but the characters guarantee this to be engaging until the poignant ending .", "overall": 5.0}

I think, for a sex worker or former sex worker, there will be many moments of laughing and/or cringing in recognition, but the stories are still massively accessible for allies or folks who aren't familiar with sex work politics at all.  I'll definitely be recommending it to everyone I know (but not loaning it out, because I'm sure someone would just *keep* it, it's that good .", "overall": 5.0}
{"reviewText": "I initially bought these because they were so cheap and i needed some reassurance that i was ovulating. After a couple months of negative pregnancy tests, i figured these wouldn't hurt. I started using the OV tests 10 days after my period started and got a very obvious negative. I used one each day, and on day 15 i saw a slightly darker line than i had been seeing. And on day 16, it was a very obvious positive that i would be ovulating soon (the two lines were the same color). This shocked me because I've been using an app to track my period for almost a year (my average cycle was 34 days). it turns out I was actually ovulating 6 days before the app predicted (so we were COMPLETELY missing our window the previous months!) When i saw the positive OV test we got busy right away! And 12 DPO, i decided to use one of the HCG tests and there was the tiniest faint line (i knew this was pretty early to test but i couldn't help!). So i waited a couple more days and took another one and it was definitely darker but still pretty light, but even a faint line only means one thing: you're pregnant! I took a digital test just to confirm because i needed all the confirmation i could get... and the digital test in fact showed the same thing: PREGNANT.I've been using up the rest of my HCG tests everyday and the line has gotten darker everyday as the HCG levels have gone up. These tests proved to be so helpful!! They are seriously so easy to use and easy to read. I would highly recommend them and not try to conceive based off an app .", "overall": 5.0}

{"reviewText": "Purportedly, oleamide exerts some of its psychoactive effects by either directly or (more likely) indirectly modulating the behavior of the brain's CB1 receptor. Subjectively, I can attest that this is the feeling that Oleamide provided me in doses between 100 and 200mg.Oleamide's &#34;endocannabinoid&#34; presence can truly be *felt*. And by that, I mean exactly what I write - an oral dose of ~125mg produces sensations uncannily similar to the physiological response produced by Cannabis, whilst lacking the psychoactive &#34;high&#34; that direct agonization of the CB2 receptor would likely provide. Therefore, in mimicking the bodily sensations of Cannabis, Oleamide has true potential across a generous landscape of applications.At more moderate doses - I would say not more than 65-70mg - Oleamide proved an effective (although somewhat sluggish feeling) anxiolytic. This is important to me, as I am attempting to decrease the developed physiological dependency I have on benzodiazepine anxiolytic medications used to combat Generalized Anxiety Disorder.At doses ranging from 100mg-150mg, Oleamide again shone brightly as an effective anxiolytic, but with an added twist - it produced moderate painkilling properties. This is not to label Oleamide a &#34;narcotic&#34; in the true sense of the word. For me, however, it did produce a &#34;fuzzy&#34; feeling lingering throughout my body that dulled the aches and pains of a day's worth of work away. In a sense, it physiologically faded my awareness of the negative sensations into the background of my conscousness, which may be a welcome benefit to many a friend of mine who use alcohol on a daily basis for just the same purpose, but with far more detrimental effect.Lastly, at higher doses between 150mg and 200mg, Oleamide performed OUTSTANDINGLY in combatting my impaired sleep-onset insomnia! Doses between 125-150mg definitely made me tired and yawn, but doses above 150mg generally lulled me into a deep slumber that was not only restorative, but was sound and lasted an ample amount of time; I would generally sleep soundly for eight or nine hours, whereas six hours per night of sleep was a milestone I could only hope to achieve beforehand.The four-star rating reflects an inherent flaw in the relationship between Oleamide's pharmacology and my body's physiology - that being an inconsistent manifestation of the aforementioned effects. While Oleamide provided the intended results at the dosages specified above consistently enough that I felt they warranted mention, there have been numerous occasions where I would ingest a known dose of Oleamide only to be either disappointed by *no* effect, or overwhelmed by an *augmentation* of the desired effect. I recall one instance where 150mg had me completely out-of-it, drifting between hazy consciousness and deep sleep, for a sixteen hour period. For practical insomnia treatment forming a proper marriage with the rigors of everyday life, this is clearly a short-coming.Overall, this compound piqued my interest enough in the potential for endocannabinoids to be used for a wide variety of practical, semi-daily applications and have since ordered Stearamide to test its properties - both individual, and in conjunction with Oleamide, as was suggested by another reviewer.I do recommend giving this product a try; its cheap price, high quality, fast delivery and the fact that its effects are immediate and not cumulative make it a winner in my book. Other nootropics, whose effects are purported to be cumultative in nature (Noopept being one I can name off the top of my head) may work, and indeed I have found them to, but a lot of me remains concerned that the benefit I get from those types of nootropics may in some part be placebo. With nootropics like Oleamide, there is no question that what I am feeling is a direct result of ingesting the material.Be safe, and please always use an accurate milligram scale when dealing with near-pure nootropic crystals like these.~ Vaya .", "overall": 4.0}
{"reviewText": "I've read a number of studies on the efficacy of Inositol in treating mental health disorders, such as GAD and OCD.The dosages used in those studies ranged from between 12 and 18 grams per day, and so I began to take 16 grams daily divided into two 8 gram administrations - one in the morning and one in the early afternoon.I used to take gabapentin (Neurontin) off-label for Mood Disorder NOS. Essentially, I used Neurontin as a 'mood stabilizer.' And this effect, in fact, was strikingly similar to that produced by my a Inositol regimen. I must say that I was both surprised and pleased!Treatment with Inositol takes patience to feel palpable results, and yet when they *are* felt, the weeks endured suddenly appear to be fleeting fancies.To qualify myself, I definitely am feeling less.... Let's say, 'antsy' inside. I do not feel the urge to move about constantly to engage in meaningless tasks that later leave me tired and unmotivated. I have also noticed that I don't get as wrapped up in social exchanges as I used to. I am far more relaxed when I speak to others, which I feel has improved my communication skills.Inositol's effects appear, in my experience, to synergize well with those of Taurine, and I recommend their co-administration whole-heartedly.I am always impressed with LiftMode products' utility, portion, presentation, purity, shipping and communication, and Inositol did not part from this paradigm.I highly recommend it .", "overall": 4.0}
{"reviewText": "Baicalin is a substance that I sampled from LiftMode for the express purpose of reviewing. I had no prior knowledge of the substance, and went into it without expectation.The first thing that I noticed was that the recommended dosage produced negligible effects; I was advised by Mark & the LiftMode team that, to produce anxiolytic effects, users typically require 500-1,000mg of Baicalin. I found these estimates to be wholly accurate, and advise prospective users of this compound to try the same!At ~500-750mg, the anxiolytic effects were quite pronounced. I noticed a natural decrease in my respiration rate (not to be confused with respiratory depression, such as that resulting from opiate/opioid ingestion!), and those things that we come across in daily life - traffic jams, less-than-ideal interactions with those whom we love, et al., appeared to be experientially less disturbing than they might without the addition of Baicalin to my regimen.Therefore, in this reviewer's opinion and experience, Baicalin is indeed as effective an anxiolytic as it is purported to be. And, for one one (such as myself) with diagnosed Generalized Anxiety Disorder - who has concurrently become dependent on benzodiazepines as a result - finding a *natural* remedy against the &#34;everyday anxieties&#34; life cannot help but impose is truly appealing!For the chronic insomniacs out here, Baicalin has something to offer you, too.At a dosage of about 1 gram (1,000mg), the sleep-inducing qualities of Baicalin are - to put it mildly - profound. I am, in addition to being prescribed Valium for GAD - prescribed prohibitively high quantities of Restoril to combat chronic sleep-onset insomnia. I find that I no longer require nearly as much of this costly hypnotic in order to fall asleep when Baicalin is added - perhaps half a capsule of Restoril (as opposed to 1-2!) - and this, alone, is worth the price in my opinion.The 4-star rating is merely due to the *ever-so-slight* inconsistencies I have experienced from Baicalin dose-for-dose; however, if Amazon were to grant me the courtesy, I would give Baicalin 4 1/2 stars hands-down!For those seeking the benefits I have above described, please do consider Baicalin to our regiment.It is WELL worth the slight price tag.~ Vaya .", "overall": 4.0}
{"reviewText": "Whilst direct comparisons between Synephrine and Ephedrine are impossible, given the large number of viable pharmacological differences that various substitutions at Synephrine's phenethylamine backbone can produce, there are similarities.Synephrine possesses comparatively weak affinity for adregnergic receptors; specifically, a1 over a2. Its principle pharmacological effects are blood pressure elevation, constriction of peripheral blood vessels and dilation of the pupils.Oral doses following LiftMode's recommend guideline of one 50mg scoop produces very light stimulation; this 'lighter' stimulation, however, I find preferable to the stimulation brought about by experimentation with dosages over 100mg. Having taken ephedrine before, I find the effects to be qualitatively quite similar - but Synephrine's weaker affinity for the adrenergic receptors means that one has more liberty with dosage experimentation without the worry of inadvertently creating a hypertensive crisis situation. This is a HUGE plus for me, as my body reacts very differently to different adrenergic agonists and I have had little success in finding one that I felt comfortable experimenting with until I found Synephrine.Synephrine also possesses several qualities that make it superior to Yohimbine HCl and Hordenine for stimulation. With respect to Yohimbine HCl, potency is the main factor. Yohimbine HCl is very active at dosages as little as 2.5-5.4mg; 2.5mg is the recommended dosage, whereas administration of 5.4mg TID has been used in most scholarly reserach articles s the test dosage for treating erecticle dysfunction. Obviously, however, a milligram scale is of the *utmost* importance when dealing with that compound. Synephrine bypasses the absolute need for a scale, however; I have taken a flattened spoonful (the spoon included with LiftMode's jar) and weighed it, and it is indeed nearly 50mg on the nose. This makes dosing less nerve-wracking and less potentially-disastrous.Synephrine is HIGHLY preferable to Hordenine, too, because Hordenine also possesses weak MAOI-B properties and can thus potentially be dangerous when combined with other widespread materials that are contraindicated with universal MAOI's, as well as those particular to MAO-B. Aside from this, though, Synephrine's stimulation is much more managable than Hordenine's. My heart races less, I sweat less, and I experience less symptoms of cardiovascular fatigue than I do with Hordenine. Synephrine's effects are much more predictable in this sense, too.Synephrine itself provides a pleasant stimulatory state, and I have personally found that - depending on the occasion and need for intensity - doses of 50, 75 and 100mg are appropriate without feeling toxic. There is an amphetamine-like quality of inspiration that I find with Synephrine that is absent from compounds like Yohimbine and Hordenine, too, which I particularly like. If I need to fill out applications, perform menial work/chores, work out, and other tasks that I am prone to putting off or neglecting altogether, I find 75mg of Synephrine seems to naturally stimulate my desire to get done what I need to do.One con of Synephrine that I have found, and one which prevents me from granting it 5/5 stars here, is the pervasive feeling of fatigue that follows the initial effects. I tend to notice an extreme absence of energy about four hours after I have taken Synephrine - one that makes it difficult to re-engage myself in everyday activities such as work or social interaction without re-dosing. In addition to making me *feel* subjectively exhausted, the after-effects of Synephrine also make me *look* exhausted; I usually have noticable dark rings under my eyes, and am yawning constantly.All said and done, though, Synephrine appears - to me- to be quite the viable alternative to Ephedrine and Pseudoephedrine, and is one with palpable and reliable effects that simultaneously does not seem to tax my cardiovascular health as much as other stimulatory nootropics. For me, it was well-worth checking out .", "overall": 4.0}

{"reviewText": "Before I begin I Would like to mention that I was supplied with a sample to test and evaluate this product, but I promise to give my honest and fair opinion.So having been used to Anker's higher-tier gaming mouse I was able to compare this one to that one, but also on a general use basis. It is a completely different mouse, and thus is has better and worse features.Product exterior: I have quite big hands, and this was comfortable to use but not for an extended duration, as I don't like to eagle grip my mouse's. Don't misread this though, it is still big enough for the average person and those with slightly bigger hands. One awesome point for this mouse though is that the whole surface area glows! This is one of the features that was missing on the higher-tier version and it looks awesome. You can have different colours depending on the DPI setting, and customize how fast it pulsates, of course it can be continual or off completely.Description of use: As with all of the Anker products I have tried or bought, it is extremely easy to install and use for an average user or above. It is quite weighty for a mouse with no interchangeable weights, which is a good sign of quality. On the higher-tier mouse you can, so this would be a semi-negative point for this model. The performance in FPS games were good, I didn't notice any mouse lag while using my Razer Goliathus mouse mat, and I wouldn't expect any different.Ideal users: I would say that mainly gamers would benefit from this mouse, as it is a gaming mouse and is designed to be comfortable for compatible hands for extended periods of time. But even the Facebook, Email casual users would enjoy this for its comfort and visual looks, it is pretty damn cool.Competitive comparison: I can only compare this to the higher-tier mouse I currently own, but if I were to only use one it would have to be the higher tier purely for comfort reasons and the fact it has interchangeable weights. If I didn't have big hands though, the aesthetics of this model would definitely tempt me to use it as a main mouse. I will still use this mouse though, for when I take my rig somewhere and want to make a statement, as it just looks cooler.Summary: This mouse is a steal for the price, and is perfect for those who are looking for top quality gaming/media peripherals. Just bear in mind that if you have big hands like me, this may not be the one for you. All in all I would say it is up there with Razer, and Steelseries .", "overall": 4.0}

They help each other through things like the female main characters music issue.. the characters are well thought out because they can tell when one another are thinking things and when they know something's up they can talk it through... together.

It has a very sharp edge that can slice through anything I put in front of it so far, which is a lot as I work in a professional kitchen, and it hasn't lost one bit of that sharpness!! This definitely a great work horse knife that can withstand a lot and won't get dinged up easily in my opinion. Great for work or a collection as it just looks great too .", "overall": 5.0}

I have a really good cleaning lady that does the job better than me.but when it comes to oven racks- no matter how much you scrub and try to clean them with harsh chemicals it just doesn't clean it competely. (I forgot to say that even though i hate cleaning, i love a clean house. lol. so i notice the smallest things if its not clean)I love carbona products. I had success with each and every one of them. especially stain devils for my boys toddler clothes. so i decoded to try it.my oven is about 8 noths old now, and i never really clean the racks very seriously. I tried with steelwool but gave up almost immediately. so you can imagine how dirty they were. we are a family pf six so we use the oven on a daily basis.I have a bosch slide in convection oven. the racks are a bit narrower than a regular oven. I barely managed to put all 3 of them in the bag and seal it. i was thinking of sealing it with wide tape which could give the racks a bit more room. but my husband did it for me and the zip just closed. so I was ok. this is the only reason I gave it 4 and not 5 stars.I put it around 7pm, mooved the liquid around a few times untill I went to sleep. the liquid was becoming brown very quickly and i could see the burned dirt slightly coming off. I didnt clean the racks before. i was too lazy.the next morning I washed them in the bathtub- the liquid was black. and the racks were sparkly clean without any effort!!!amazing .", "overall": 4.0}

I have been hearing a lot and seeing a lot about the health benefits of \"juicing\" (no, not steroids, but making juices from raw, fresh veggies at home). My family actually bought a juicer; however, there were actually MANY simple facts about how our bodies work with what we eat. She addresses everything from misconceptions to recipes. Once I tried a few of the recipes, my reservations about drinking the vegetable/fruit mixes completely dissolved. I couldn't believe how delicious some of it was together! She stated that with this book as your guide, you'll be \"on your way in no time.\" And she definitely delivered. It made learning about nutrition fun and interesting - easy to read, but not boring. At first glance, it seems like it will be brief and general, but I was surprised to find so many technical questions answered, and so much information provided. It was a quick read but it has a wealth of knowledge. This book is a total beginners guide that sheds light AND motivates, yet doesn't take months to get through .", "overall": 5.0}

Speaking of being snuggled up, it has served me as a pillow on a 6 hour trip southbound.I would recommend this pillow to any mother nursing or just bottle-feeding.

{"reviewText": "Oblivion will be criticized for its lack of originality, and this may be deserved, but what it lacks in mind blowing plot twists it makes up for in energy, presentation, and overall effect.The movie creates two contrasting worlds brilliantly: the clinical 2001esque angles of the cloud condo and drone technology, complete with an ominous hal-like red eye, and the broken cyberpunk remnants of civilization, now home to the Scavenger adversaries from which Cruises character must protect himself. More than once, I found myself looking at concepts I'd seen before, but never did I feel Oblivion failed to recreate these mainstays of the Sci-fi genre in its own way; rather, it did a brilliant job of making some of them its own.I enjoy Cruise in Sci-fi roles, there's something house-hold about him that keeps things relevant. He delivers a typical steadfast performance as the care taker of humanities remaining presence on earth, but he's bettered by Angela Riseborough's witty and emotional depiction of his bed sharing Communications Officer. Other notable names aside, it's a one man show with Cruise firmly at the helm, but whereas other movies may have been built for him, this one was not.In summary, Oblivion is a very well made and well paced movie, which manages to cover a wide portion of the Sci-fi genre, without copying it. It's a satisfying and beautifully shot film, with an unpredictably predictable end .", "overall": 4.0}

The rest of this motion picture soundtrack is intermittently better than others you mightbe attracted to, but these two cats REALLY burn up the town with their call-and-answer passages.

Most of the information I read from this book was stuff I had never heard off. It gives incite on the main contributors in the start of America. It sums up the political differences and major agreements made, as in finical and the location of the capital. Also, one of the main focuses was on the relationship between John Adams and Thomas Jefferson, and how their friendship was destroyed for a while because of their political differences. In my opinion, the book focused a lot on the political differences between all of the founding brothers which even led to death. But I'm trying not to give out any spoilers.Being a teenager, I found this book boring at times because it is filled with information and contains words that I have never heard of before. However, It did make me understand more about what happened after the American Revolution and the shaping of the nation. I found the chapters about the duel between Aaron Burr and Alexander Hamilton and George Washington's Farewell Address most interesting. Also, the fact that John Adams' wife, Abigail Adams, was a main political adviser to her husband and told him to kept in mind of the women in the nation was very interesting to me. I would recommend this book to anyone that wants to know the most important events and discussion made after the American Revolution. Also, if you are trying to understand a little more about the roles of the founding fathers, then this is an excellent book for you .", "overall": 4.0}

The only problems I've had with it are slight discomfort at the top, like others have noted, and another thing that I have not seen others note in their reviews: my cables became faulty after the first few weeks of use, so now I have to bend the cable a little bit for it to transmit signal to my laptop. I'm going to try out a coiled cable from Mediabridge, so that should be the end of that problem soon... Which leads me to another thing I'm very happy with about these headphones: replaceable cables! I've always had a problem with headphone cables breaking, and with these I don't have to buy a whole new pair just because the cable broke.TL;DR: Great sound, good price, maybe not the most comfortable all the time and not the most durable cables, but easy to replace.

{"reviewText": "I just got this delivered earlier today morning via Fedex. Package was in a padded envelope, would've preferred a box. Was replacing a 2.5\" Toshiba 160GB 5400rpm hard drive in my mid 2009 MacBook Pro 13\" (with 8gb of RAM). My laptop is only compatible with SATA II (3gbit/s transfer) and not SATA III (6gbit/s) - this SSD drive is SATA III, but is backward compatible with SATA II as well. Installation of the SSD drive was pretty simple, had to remove the bottom lid and four t6 torx screws from the HDD itself. Fired up the laptop and started the install of Mac OS X Leopard. I had to format the SSD drive first, so that Mac OSX would be able to recognize the ssd drive. After OSX was installed, i started to test the speediness. Boot up time from hitting the power on button used to be 53 seconds with the Toshiba HDD and now is 14 seconds flat (SSD) till I see my desktop! I'm real satisfied with the drop in time for a cold boot up. I use my laptop mostly for VMWare and Excel spreadsheet work. A virtualized Windows XP machine now takes about 41 seconds to boot with the SSD, while the Toshiba HDD took about 57 seconds. Opening an Excel spreadsheet for the very first time (after boot up) with the SSD takes about 3.5 seconds, it took about 16 seconds with the Toshiba HDD (after boot up as well) - big jump in speed! I listen to Pandora a lot on Firefox and was hoping that Adobe Flash, which is utilized predominantly by the site, would function better, but alas it does not - still causes occasional stuttering. I suppose an SSD can't alleviate much of that frustration. Firing up Mozilla Firefox 3 is near instantaneous, though it was speedy earlier as well. I did happily notice that when i quit out of Firefox while Pandora is playing, it's instant - used to take ~2 seconds before (annoyed me back then). I'm not seeing too many 'rainbow wheels' so far, but that could be alluded to the clean OSX install - that's normal for all new operating system installs. Since this drive is only 64gb in size, one should get it if they intend to install only their operating system/mission critical applications on it - large videos/music should be kept on either an external USB drive or a regular platter based HDD. I myself still have about 30gbs left after copying my important documents and (1) virtual machine. Prices for SSD drives are still very expensive @ $2.00/gb, whereas a regular HDD is about $0.11/gb as of today. Only four stars due to the high price! Hope this review helped, please feel free to comment with questions .", "overall": 5.0}

It seems to add about another half charge of my battery when I turn it on, great for gaming or traveling.

{"reviewText": "Packaging: Packaging from Razer is phenomenal as always. I had no worries about this in transit. The Box amazon use to ship the keyboard in was the perfect length, not a 100% fit but they added these air packets.Functionality: This being a keyboard aimed at gamers does what it advertises. I can fully programme all the keys to be macros or whatever i like. They added 5 extra keys which comes in handy. The mechanical keys are loud and if your looking for something to play at night with everyone sleeping, not the best choice right here. However, i can recommend the stealth edition. The keys are narrower and will take some getting used to time but once you use it, you will never want to go back to a membrane keyboard. The passthrough USB and audio input and output come very handy for me as i am always taking files in and out of my computer. Cleaning the Blackwidow is so much easier to clean then a membrane keyboard and i had many problems with that. (Taking the keys out to clean the undersection)Design: The design is magnificent. It's slick and an eye-catcher. It fits a gamer's crib perfectly. The LED lights can be blindingly bright and can be pin-point adjusted to suit your environment. The matte finish is great and a huge improvement from the previous versions of the blackwidow. However, i like my equipment in tip-top shape and if you have sweaty hand like i do, it doesn't get fingerprints but more of a dark smudge. I often find myself with a damp cloth wiping away the mess every-now and then. Personally, i don't think it's THAT bad to be a deal-breaker. It is very well built hefty and sturdy. Weighs a decent weight so it won't move around on your table in those desperate moments.Drivers: I think the drivers could be improve, before i installed the drivers i tested its functionality and the backlighting would change in an instant. With the drivers installed the backlighting would take an extra second to change it's profile. Other then that the drivers are very well presented and easy to use.Conclusion: If your looking for an eye-catcher and an upgrade for your cheap membrane keyboard you stole from work. This is the whole package. If you can get this on sale it's a must have and should not be looked past. however i don't recommend you get this at full price, it's just there are so many more functional keyboard out there for a lesser price .", "overall": 5.0}

THERE IS A REASON why everyone hated halo reach. althoug this game isnt as bad as reach was, it is still no true halo.Halo will never be the same, especially when they keep trying to make it more and more like COD.AT 343, STOP. WE like halo because its different then COD, so stop trying to make them the same, your just killing the game, if we want a cod like feel, we will play cod.

I was very concerned that the headlight would eventually fall off overtime. Great news of all, after receiving the product a few days I received a email from one of the chief marketing officer of the company saying they receive several concerns about the rubber strap and in the final stages of re-engineering a studier one. Also, said they will be shipping the new front mount to all their customers at no cost. I was very pleased to hear this, this has been the best customer service I've experienced shopping on Amazon! I was initially skeptical to see if they would hold up to their word.  As I waited, turns out that they did indeed re-design a very solid bracket that does hold the light in place very well!  The interesting part, which I rarely see from companies any more, a sincere hand written letter from the company president. Given that he told me to be honest in his letter, I am doing to have to give this a three star review.  It would have been a one star review if would have not been for the company sending me the new bracket.  I really like Magnus Innovation and would be a repeat buyer.  I would give a 5 star review the next purchase or new product. I would highly recommend shopping with this company as they offer excellent customer service and sincerely listen to their customer's problems .", "overall": 3.0}

The carrier expands as the baby grows by unzipping the zipper in the middle.  This Carrier is made for a baby's and a parent's comfort. The padded straps and support on the lower back and shoulders spread the weight so well you even don't feel it! Finally I can carry my son in a properly made carrier. I used others and mu child screamed in them. Then I made a research and top nine carriers included Cybex.

{"reviewText": "Before we get into anything else first, let's just talk about the COVER. The art on this hardcover is stunning, and each super-hero stands out, and yet at the same time none of them are too over-bearing.I will not reveal spoilers about this collection of issues #1-6, because it's actually nothing like I expected it. So, :1). The plot is like a decent Hollywood action movie. (I say this in a good way). Everything is dramatic, and there are pauses in action sequences that a movie would have.2). It reads pretty quickly, but it's very enjoyable.3). Some characters will annoy you. The members of the Justice League don't even really like each other.4). Just like the cover, Jim Lee has drawn a wonderful story.5). I, (personally), feel like Cyborg was just kind of thrown in there. He definitely deserves a spot, (really liked him in the Teen Titans), but they did  incorporate him in an adequate way.Overall, I would honestly give this book a 4.5, but since you can't do that, I just gave it a 5.

At first, I had to put it down for a moment, because he really does whatever he feels.The art in this comic was done well, and there are some cool concept features of Deathstroke at the end of the sixth comic.Overall, I'd recommend it to people who want a change in pace, and if you never knew Deathstroke, (like I did), you should get this .", "overall": 4.0}
{"reviewText": "As one of the last Megaman videogames, Megaman ZX Advent delivers a sequel which is at least twice as fun as its predecessor.In this game, you can either play as a Reploid boy named Grey, or a hunter girl named Ashe. They both have their own storylines, and have certain distinct attributes that are highlighted as you play as them.Other than the awesome gameplay, this version of the game has voice actors, which do help bring more depth to the game, (even if it is a little corny at times). It is also interesting to see how both characters interact with Biometal Model A, ( a very &#34;cheeky&#34; one), who allows Grey and Ashe to Megamerge, becoming the ultimate Megaman.To be honest, I haven't finished the game myself yet, because there are a lot of side missions you can do while progressing the main story line. I find myself sometimes as well just standing in a certain zone just listening to the awesome music of the stages. The difficulty of the game is still somewhat difficult, (especially to newer players), but it's doable and rewarding for sure. Speed-running for this game should be a lot of fun, due to all the Megaman and Pseudo-droids you can turn into. I feel that there was a lot of love put into this game, and as one of the last Megaman games it captured some of  the best moments of the Maverick series .", "overall": 5.0}

I have chubby cheeks and more of a rounder face for a skinny girl. They are very flattering and a great buy for the price. If you are looking for nerd glasses with a feminine, chic edge- get these!

While it was apparant that the author did her reasearch, she forgot one thing - THE FREAKIN PERSONALITY OF THE MAIN CHARACTER. I gave up reading it because as a Laika fan, It was painful to read.According to many resources, the \"i hate the world\" mentality in this version of Laika wasn't part of the real dog. In fact, it is believed that she was an docile little one, loyal and trusting. This laika also has an ego that was very apparent in chapter 3, while guess what? DOGS DON'T UNDERSTAND MIRRORS. Nor was Laika a sour, sulking pessimist!  Get the facts right! My image of Laika, innocent, naive, patient, little curly tail, was just smacked in the face. Laika was the most patient and docile of the bunch!She was no Katniss Everdeen, she wasn't defiant. She enjoyed everything, acording to reports. Look at her eyes. Do those look distrustful and angry? No, I see an innocent little puppy-at-heart who is as loyal as Buck from \"Call of the Wild\". And it is well known that on the flight on the sputnik 2, Laika wasn't as calm as she was in here. Her poor little heart was beating three times as fast as normal, and she died in agony, being baked to death. If you want to read a more true to character story, read the graphic novelLaikaby Nick Abadzis. Laika's and Albania's personalities seem to switch, and our heroine's charming innocence makes the reader feel for our little angel.

You have a great shoe people but jeez, a little pricey.......and I was checking out your sandals but personally, I think a person has to be making good money or be plum nuts because I will never pay 100 or more dollars for a pair of flip flops even if they are made by fitflop.  If you lowered your prices I could honestly say I would by nothing but your brand but I consider myself ahead when I can even buy new shoes, so hopefully as I continue to surf I will come across another pair for a decent price but so far I haven't found the ankle boot anywhere for under 65 bucks.......but I will keep looking a while longer before I break down and pay the price .", "overall": 5.0}

I bought these in a 15 triple E and I won't say they are good looking, how can they be when you have feet that big but by golly they fit him the only complaint is they look like you are wearing them on the wrong feet but for someone with the problems he has and the fact he should never walk barefoot because if he cuts himself he doesnt heal easily and he cant feel it anyway if he does so he wears these to walk to the mailbox and stuff like that.  we were just happy they fit .", "overall": 3.0}

{"reviewText": "I've had Buffalo external drives in the past and haven't had any problems with them at all. I decided it was time to switch to something more compact and with a higher capacity. So I opted for the LaCie Minimus. Big, big mistake! In fact, I bought two of them, so I am double the fool. They look good and solid, small compared to my other hard drives, and come in a heat-reducing alluminium casing. These are the only positive comments I can make. I bought two of these things, less than a year ago so I could transfer all my work data and personal downloads. They have hardly been used, and have been kept safe and secure when not in use. One of them has stopped working completely. It just won't come to life and be recognised on my computer. I am not prepared to fork out 400 quid to have it extracted, if that is indeed possible, and if I return it to LaCie they will format it so the data will be lost (unless I pay their service a fortune to have it extracted first). I won't be using a LaCie product ever again, so whether to return the disk is a moot point. Now to the other one. An annoying point about LaCie is that the drive needs formatting before first use. Buffalo never did. They were just plug and play. This second drive tells me that it needs formatting before use, however, it was formatted and data was stored on it from another computer months ago. Properties tells me that the drive is empty, so where has all my data gone? These drives are 100% unreliable. If you care about your data, don't touch this shoddy product with a bargepole!

{"reviewText": "I'm 17 and I discovered I had inverted nipples a few years ago. I was pretty embarrassed about it, but this product has been incredible. I've been wearing the nipplettes for about six weeks and I see dramatic changes. I had moderately inverted nipples (one more so than the other), and they've been mostly corrected. I wear the product for 8-12 hours a day, and you can't see the cups under the majority of clothing. While they didn't stay on well at first, I bought lanolin cream which helped with the suction. After 2-3 weeks, my nipples filled the cups completely. While my nipples initially reverted soon after I took the cups off for the first couple of weeks, they are now everted most of the time, with the exception of a small slit (I'm hoping this will disappear with further use). I've recently skipped a day or two wearing them, and my nipples remain out but with a flat top/more pronounced slit. The cups hurt a little at first, and there was a bit of clear discharge, but I've developed a tolerance over time. I'd suggest re-suctioning the cups every few hours because the nipple tissue takes time to stretch out. Overall an amazing product that I'd recommend to anyone with this problem! I look forward to even better results over the next few weeks .", "overall": 5.0}

{"reviewText": "Probably the best beginner's camera out there that produces quality photos at almost laughable costs! I bought mine used for $60 (body only) with a kit lens ($40) and the f/1.8 50mm ($80). Combine all of that, I have a $180 dSLR to learn from until I have the money to purchase a better body. The previous reviews have hit the jackpot on why you shouldn't get this camera, but I'm here to tell you why you definitely SHOULD.1. Ability to upgrade to the hacked firmware[...] (guide to updating your 300D: [...]- Enables Custom functions menu- Enables Flash Exposure Compensation using SET button- Enables SET button function when shooting (to change image quality or shooting parameters)- Enables Shutter release w/o CF card- Flash sync speed in Av mode- Enables RAW+JPEG rec. Enables setting the quality of embedded JPEG- Enables Mirror Lock up- Enables the ability to select the autofocus mode: AI servo, Oneshot etc.- Enables setting ISO 3200With the updated firmware, the camera is completely customizable, and you'll be able to learn all about how to create the best shots2. Using manual external flashes. I bought a used speedlight for $30 and have been creating unbelievable images using bounce flashes. Who needs e-TTL2 or whatever anyway? Go with manual and learn the right way!3. It's more about the lens, less about the camera body. With a tremendous lens, any SLR will produce amazing photographs. Sure the ISO quality is terrible with 800 ISO or higher, but programs such as Adobe Lightroom and filter programs will get rid of some of the noise. The sensor is not as larger as the newer models, but with the external flash, a tripod, anything you can do with your $700 dSLR, I can do with my 300D.4. Best of all, this camera is faster and, simply, better, than any of digital point and shoots. I have a modern, 18MP megazoom camera that I use for mobile reasons, but it has nowhere the quality as the 300D.5. Buy a $5 external CF card reader and you won't have to deal with the USB1.1 speeds.6. Who cares about the small screen and the slow preview times? You can take thousands of photos on RAW at a time with a 4GB card - just review and delete later on your computer .", "overall": 5.0}

The 120GB SSD runs Windows 7, while the HDD with the caddy serves both as a backup drive, storage drive, as well as a bootable Windows drive. My laptop is a custom Sager, but I'm sure this can fit anywhere.Shipping -I have Prime, so I one-dayed it, and it came in one day. Thanks Amazon!First impressions- Fast! It didn't slow down transfer speeds of my old toshiba drive whatsoever. Combined with the power of the SSD, my computer now runs extremely fast.- Supports IDE 2.5\" HDD to be used instead of an internal IDE optical drive in an older laptop needeng an extra HDD while CD/DVD/Blue ray device to be used externally via USB2/3 or eSATA.- Provides 4 screws.- Had a modular structure - can find a way to fit in any laptop, unscewing extra plastic parts designed for IBM laptop along its edges or even remove the rear connecting plug to IDE, allowing to use the classical connection underneath.Cons- Flimsy plastic.- On the rear edge there is no choice to screw in the original attachment fixture which were used for internal laptop optical drive - I had to fix it with only one screw. But since entire unit stays put inside laptop - I believe that one screw is just enough.- Since the caddy was thinner than my BluRay drive, the internal parts of my laptop is exposed.

The 120GB SSD runs Windows 7 with many applications installed - including one game and many work-specific applications, while the HDD serves both as a backup drive, storage drive, as well as a bootable Windows drive. I have around 10GB free of the 112GB total. My laptop is a custom Sager, but I'm sure this can fit anywhere.Shipping- I have Prime, so I one-dayed it, and it came in one day. Thanks Amazon!First Impressions- Came in a nice box with a desktop bay. Since I didn't need that, it goes into storage.- Install was more than easy. Simply take out your old drive, insert the SSD, place the old HDD into an optic caddy for a laptop or another slot on a desktop. I did a clean install of Windows 7 using my old passcode and a USB drive - took less than an hour to get up and running.Pros- Blazing fast speeds for booting up and shutting down (10 second boot-up until I can load up an application and 5 seconds shut down)- Great read/write speeds (took 12 minutes to install windows 7, 3 minutes to install Matlab)- Loads any application in a fraction of a second- Great transfer speeds for USB/external hard drives on USB 3.0- No more \"waiting\" or \"loading\" screens on a game like Call of Duty- No sound- No heating issues- Resistant to dropping/shock due to the fact that it doesn't have a spinning disk like most HDDs- Longer battery life (almost 4 hours now with a 15in screen and web browsing, up from around 3 hours)Cons- The fact that you haven't gotten yourself one yet!Notes- Make sure to switch the SATA ports to AHCI in bios before you install the OS on the SSD. Otherwise the drivers will not install properly and you'll have to reinstall the OS again.Great tool for anyone who doesn't need an optic drive and wants extra data to be placed in a drive inside the computer rather than externally. This, hands down, is one of the best investments you can make when building a PC. Sure, capacity isn't the greatest, but your system runs like a champ. This SSD gets a 7.9 with Windows built in benchmarking, and loads Windows so fast the logo (at boot) doesn't have time to assemble the Windows logo completely before leaping to the desktop.My laptop:Sageri7 quad-core 2Ghz8GB RAMKingston 120GB SSDToshiba 600GB HHD in optic caddyNVIDIA 540M .", "overall": 5.0}

We did the 7 day rental, but plan on buying it as soon as possible. Great for all ages, there is one small scene of not even partial nudity, it's tasteful and does not even have the typical anime feel.

There is a small support built into the case to prop up the display so that you can work at a table instead on having it on your lap. I bought 2 of these for my sales people to protect their tablets. It comes with a USB charge cable for the keyboard that can be used with the Samsung wall adapter that comes with the tablet.

There is such a thing called \"in between\" beginner and concert pianist. This huge area is intermediate. Learning piano the way Scott presents it will keep you stuck at the beginner level. It may bring temporary enjoyment but eventually you will get bored and want to move forward in your learning. He disregards the importance of fingering and  technique amongst MANY other things therefore creating bad habits that are VERY HARD to break. If you skip over these you will get extremely frustrated and probably quit. As a professional teacher of 17 years I've seen this time and time again. Learning an instrument is NOT easy and requires much more work to succeed than what the general population thinks. It's incredibly rewarding and as an adult CAN be done! Do yourself a favor and get a teacher trained in pedagogy. You will learn everything Scott is trying to teach but without the grand lack of important skills that will enable you to enjoy playing music forever. IMPORTANT: you can learn to play quickly if you WORK at it and have the right teacher! Our society is tied down by \" instant gratification\"I'm not an \"old school\" teacher and there are others out there that understand the importance of getting an adult to play quickly so they don't lose interest and feel defeated. However , a trained professional can teach you in the way you learn best without skipping important lessons that could possibly inhibit your progression of learning.

{"reviewText": "its nice it looks and feels good and its a wind up clip but there are cons like the charger makes a buzzing sound its all plastic and the wind up clip doesn't work all the time and the whole front sight is all orange which you can easily paint and you may have to oil the outside of the clip so it goes in and in and out better but i do like it. some pros are looks really nice the back sight is adjustable good long lasting battery goes fully automatic and its very strong i would think its around 300 fps great for a beginner and even with plastic bbs it still is strong. I would suggest you get it .", "overall": 4.0}

{"reviewText": "this is probably the BEST!!!!! full metal spring gun you can get. the shipping was great and it has great detail, and accuracy. its double action but it doesn't shoot when you pull the hammer back unless you pull back the slide. the 2 mags that it comes with are almost entirely made out of metal and is hi cap that holds about 90 bbs. the slide has an opening ejection port and the sights are great but you might want to put white out on them because its hard to see during the night. the slide lock doesn't work but if you pull it out a little bit it work. its a great gun and i recommend it to any beginner or someone who just wants an awesome spring gun so what i'm saying here is that you should defiantly get the gun .", "overall": 5.0}
{"reviewText": "its a nice replica of a ppk and its good for beginners i would recommend it because of the cheap price and other things which ill write. the grip the trigger the mag and the inside of it is mostly is plastic but its not such a big deal. the downside is its very hard to cock especially for people who are not that strong so if your gonna get this i suggest you work out a little. sometimes the gun jams you can tell it did if the slide is staying back, its easy to fix take out the mag and pull back the slide a couple of times and a bb will fall out then its unjammed. the whole barrel is orange but not such a big deal. yes, I'm writing a lot of downsides to the gun but its strong maybe 220 fps so it packs a nice punch and the slide and other parts of the gun is metal which is great its a nice gun i recommend it for strong beginners and not a beginner and its a nice james bond ppk looking gun .", "overall": 4.0}

{"reviewText": "WHY did I waste my time and energy? I am not saying this due to the horrific ending (however much I hated it) But more along the lines of what I believe YA represents. In YA novels, there is usually a common ending to series and that is hope of some sort. No, it doesn't have to be in rose colored glasses, but it is why many of us choose to escape from our daily lives to immerse ourselves in theirs. This took the first two books that I loved, and destroyed the whole series for me. I truly believe that Veronica wanted to KILL her YA novel career by this move. I would never invest my time an energy in another book if she ever writes one. I didn't find this edgy, creative, or noble. I found it weak and disappointing. It has been made very obvious by her interviews and appearances, that she has thrived in all the negative feedback of this book. I guess her attitude justifies my exact reason of why this book is the worst I have ever read. She never really loved Tris, nor the readers that invested their time, energy & money into this story .", "overall": 1.0}

If things went just like the first three books and ended, I would have felt EXTREMELY unsastisfied. Book four was a slower read yes, but it adapted the characters beautifully and I appreciated figuring them out just that more.I have to admit I found this book sinister & sexy. *spoiler* Even with knowing Sebastian being an ultimate villain, I loved his scenes, his wit, his sexiness in a villian kind of way. Yes his incest lust is sick, but what a villian Sandra created here! I loved it.  I also loved the &#34;possessed&#34; Jace. Not in the bound to sebastian kind of way, but the part where he could let his inabitions run free & not be so tormented with himself all the time. The bone chandelier chapter & The club scene in Prague? Kill yourself sexy, hot & down right my most favorite chapter in all five books.My only negative was the end of the series. Now we get to be tortured with this fire in Jace that might hurt Clary. Sexual tension drug out a little longer. I am sure all that frustration will lead to an explosive passion that will burn down my favorite scene in the club at Prague.

A tip if you purchase this is to plan on using your own longer black cami or tankSecond issue I had with this top is the length (as another reviewer also noted). The length provided in measurements on here would only be achieved if the shirt was really stretched. It has cinched sides which make it shorter than these measurements state. I also found it odd that the front of the shirt is noticeably longer than the back. that might not bother some, but I think it should be noted for consumers.The only positive of this shirt for me, is that the lace is a soft stretchy material which makes it unique.

The weather man was right about the bad weather.  At 8:30 a huge nasty thunder storm with heavy rain, lightning and 50+ winds.  We left the tent and slept in the jeep based on the park ranger telling us to seek shelter in our vehicles.  The storm lasted about 3 hours.  When it was all over we looked out and the tent was still standing and in really good shape.  We checked inside to find the floor only had a few puddles.  We were very pleased at how well the tent with stood the weather.  I would recommend this tent for durability and ease of set up!  Gotta love a Coleman Tent .", "overall": 5.0}

{"reviewText": "I originally saw the theatrical version of the film first and absolutely loved it, then I saw the director's cut. I fell in love with the first version I saw, but the director's cut was terrible. It had a lot of useless scenes that did not need to be in the film, like Lily's singing. Many reviews say that the theatrical version doesn't make sense, but the plot is super easy to follow and in my opinion a lot better. The director's cut just adds 20 extra minutes of scenes that aren't needed to follow the plot. Whatever version of Legend you like, it is pure magic and a perfect fantasy movie. Legend Ultimate Edition is awesome, it has both the director's cut and the theatrical version. I love everything about the DVD set, it's a must have if you love Legend .", "overall": 5.0}

{"reviewText": "I debated between one and two stars. I desided to be kind. This balaclava has three drawbacks... First it is way too tight when trying to put on over the head. My head is not that big. Trying to pull this balaclava on with gloves is more difficult than it should be. Second, the neck is poorly designed. It's not only too tight but it's also too long. It has to be rolled up to be comfortable making it even tighter. If it's going to be this long, it should be designed to fit the chest and shoulders better. Last and most important the part that fits over the nose is dangerously tight. Once again, I do not have a large nose. In fact it could be considered a bit on the small size. This balaclava is so tight on the nose it mashes the nose into the face. This pressure restricts blood circulation in the nose. In extreme and prolonged cold this would lead to frostbite of the nose. The material if fine. Some of the best but because of the poor overall design I gave it two stars. There is no excuse for not understanding something as simple as, if the blood has a hard time flowing, the flesh freezes. The OR gorilla mask is a much safer choice .", "overall": 2.0}
{"reviewText": "Cord did not work after one week. Seems to be a short in the connector to the tablet. Cheaply made .", "overall": 1.0}
{"reviewText": "The suction part holds firm to the the glass. The &#34;arms &#34; which hold the tablet lock fairly well.  Ther is a problem with one of the holdin arms interfering with the volume control. If you try to flip the arm section around to attach it to the tablet, the arm section and the sucker section will not stay together. The problem is how the arms section connect to the sucker part of the device. There are four small holes in the back of the arm section that match up with the connection points on the suction part. These points slide to hold but just barely and not at all if the arm section is attached in a way they do not cover the volume controls.  If the point slide is in a direction where the slide is catching and your vehicle hits the slightest bump in the road the two parts disconnect sending your tablet crashing down onto the dash or in my case in a Jeep, onto the gear shift knob. Thus a broken tablet screen. If there was a way to give this device no stars I would have. Why go to the trouble of making what could be a fine device and poorly designing one of the most important parts. If you plan on useing this device make sure your car is not moving and your volume is set before you put your tablet into the mount. One poorly designed section makes this device not just worthless but very costly when it breaks your tablet .", "overall": 1.0}

I decided that since I was going to use them for rags (thin one at that) that I try to wash them and did so in HOT water and through in the dryer. Believe it or not but they came out fitting like a glove. The reason I gave this review a 2 star was due to the material being paper thin and almost completly see through. One the other hand what do you want for $19.00. This company needs to hire a quality control person to assure that the close are all made the same.

That being said: Because they are so comfortable I will keep them and even go so far as to say that I will purchase another pair in Black and hope that they are not as see through, if they are I give up. &#34;The reason for the two star is the vendor's not honest with the pic...

{"reviewText": "These were time-consuming to install, especially with no instructions included with the fenders. I was able to search for and download instructions for a similar fender set, and used those as a guide. I don't like how bulky the plastic clips are that attach to the fenders and hold the stays in place. My tires are knobby mountain bike tires, and the outer knobby tread rubs against the clips. I had to bend the stays so that they bow outward to get more clearance. This applies abnormal pressure to the clips, which can only be bad in terms of durability. I particularly believe this to be true because the instructions I found, which were for a similar fender made by Axiom, say the stays need to attach at right angles to the fenders. The clips also do not appear very durable, and I expect them to wear out or break soon. Especially the front clips, which are designed to release should debris clog the fenders, risking harm to the rider. However, I suppose the price was reasonable enough, and so far they have kept me from getting a skunk stripe up my back or mud flung in my face when riding in inclement weather .", "overall": 3.0}

{"reviewText": "\"Light & Dark: The Awakening of the Mageknight\" is a fantasy adventure fiction of a 13 year old boy, Danny Firoth, who discovers that he has powers that are of a different world. \"Light & Dark\" traces Danny's transition from an average student in his school to his development as a Knight of Light at a Knight's academy called the \"White Rock Academy\".The novel successfully draws the reader into this magical world, a place of elves and dragons and other magical creatures. Fife knows exactly what he wants in this world, what he wants of his characters and what they are to do. My favourite was the dwarf blacksmith, Sir Bartlett Firebeard who although played only a minor role. I was actually hoping to see more of him. There are other concepts that will keep you intrigued and turning through the pages to the end such as \"The Navi\", \"Bonded\" and \"Drakes\". I quite enjoyed this book and would recommend this to persons of any ages.

I was particularly impressed with this style in Tea Party Teddy and sought out to purchase The Teddy Saga in my curiosity to see if she would  manage to invoke as much excitement as she did in the first one. Truly enough, she does not disappoint.The Dear Reverend, as he is referred to, is your typical antagonist that everyone loves to hate. But what makes him unique is his hypocritical public persona. The kind of man everyone talks secretly about but no one dares to stand up to. His despicable characterization makes him perfect to carry on the legacy of the almost equally hated Teddy Randall in the first book.The ending was certainly a surprise and the suspense was wonderfully handled through the course of the story. Alternated at clever intervals with humor, action and drama, Tea Party Teddy was a short,exciting read.

The issue of black slaves in the early period of America is heart wrenching and to read about it always puts me into a very emotional state. So unless I trust an author to narrate his/her period piece well enough, I try and avoid it. Otherwise it annoys the hell out of me.Seeing that this was based on Nat Turner, the African American slave who led the slave rebellion, I just wasn't sure if the author would be able to deliver it to my expectations. But Cagle's Prophet took me by pleasant surprise. He's done his research and relayed a story that touched my heart. From the first very page on how black slaves were captured in their homeland and then their journey to the plantations of Virginia, caught my attention and soon I was turning the pages, eager to know what lay ahead.

But as soon as I started reading, I was yet once more reminded why I should never make assumptions. This book took me by complete surprise, having me turn the pages consistently until I reached the very end.The story covers a love period lasting from 1533 to 2007. Now how is that even possible? Well, without giving too much away, there is paranomal and time-travel, heightening it to one great romantic adventure. Other than that, I was completely in love with the language and the culture as the author depicted it. Baker is eloquent and appropriately positions language as per the time involved.And then there is the love lorn Gian Luca who painfully searches through time for his beloved, Catarina- THE Queen Catarina de Medici of France which gives a completely new twist to the story.Love, longing, adventure- This story will enchant you through and through .", "overall": 5.0}

{"reviewText": "\"Gringa- In the Cltuches of a Ruthless Drug Lord\" is not your occasional sweet romance. If you're looking for one, I suggest that you put this down and find another. But if you're not averse to capture bonding, rape, vulgarity, sex and drugs, then by all means read on. \"Gringa\" is a smart and crude rendition of \"Beauty and the Beast\". It's an adult mini-series that traces the experiences of a woman who willingly barters herself in exchange for the lives of villagers to- you guessed it- a drug lord. Yes, she is a strong, feisty, foul mouthed character that stands up to an equally dominant man, which makes the story quite exciting. While I found the the drug lord to be revolting in the first instance, I began to empathise with him towards the end of the story. Rabi leaves the story at such a point where you would be keen to learn more of what would become of the relationship between 'Gringa' and the drug lord.

Yes, it holds elements of fantasy but that is minor compared to the social issues Chapman discusses in his novel. I was so rapped with the strength of this character in the midst of all the social troubles she was facing that I had not realised that the fantasy crept in at a much later part of the novel. And I didn't even mind!! But when it did, there were adventures, action, romance that had me turning the pages like a clockwork. I couldn't put the book down until I was done with it!

{"reviewText": "Elodie Parkes does it again! She gives another erotic tale of love entwined with mystery and suspense.Although this is a little shorter than her other novels, it still doesn't fail to hook its reader from the beginning to the end. The paranormal aspect is a great backdrop for a perfect menage.I loved the two male characters- Nathan and Reed. I wish I could tell you more on them but I'd end up revealing the plot. Makes you wish Ms Parkes had more to the tale and hope she will write more on them.So if you're looking for quality erotica, then I would definitely recommend this one .", "overall": 5.0}
{"reviewText": "I'm very particular of historical romances. I took a chance with this one. I haven't regretted it. Like the title, it certainly has that Jane Austen feel to it. It is beautifully and eloquently written which is quite pleasing.Portia, the female protagonist is a likable character in addition to her very handsome romantic interest, Phillip Salisbury. There are enough twists and turns to keep you captivated despite the short length. But don't be mistaken. It is an entire story. Highly recommended for anyone seeking a short regency romance .", "overall": 5.0}
{"reviewText": "Elodie Parkes writes a short seductive tale between two people who had always meant to be together.Daisy is just the ordinary girl who falls head over heels with the handsome stranger, Dhruv, who frequents the bar she works in. Unbeknownst to her, the man knows her only too well and wants her just as much.Parkes weaves an effective mysteriousness into this book, combined with sexy hot scenes that will have you begging for more. But more than that I was intrigued by the element of love between the two characters and I wish this could have been explored more in detail. Regardless, this is definitely your coffee table romance (or your subway romance, whichever you prefer), you won't regret to pick up for that 'on the go' moment. Definitely a winner. Loved it through and through. Highly recommended for all erotica lovers looking for substance .", "overall": 5.0}

{"reviewText": "\"I see the Devil\" is about a mentally ill patient called Jeremy who attempts to commit suicide after believing that his friend Aidan is Lucifer, the Devil incarnate. Aidan helps Jeremy break out of prison and they go on a mission to bring about the apocalypse.This is truly a noir book with a paranormal twist. Not your usual genre fiction. If you're a fan of Palahniuk and other noir writers like Clevenger you might enjoy this one. Being inside Jeremy's head was a little twisted at times, and there might be a few issues I have with the plot, but it is entertaining. Be warned that it is violent with a clever, befitting use of abusive language. If you don't mind that, then you'd enjoy this mature and excellently written read .", "overall": 4.0}

I was very surprised to find that after everything dried, all of the buttons work just fine! Some of the stickers are a little worn from being wet, but even they held up better than I expected. I definitely don't recommend washing the house like this unless you have to, but I think it says something for its durability that it survived .", "overall": 4.0}

{"reviewText": "As a single woman seriously considering marriage to a particular person and having a family, and complicated, even in these Obama days, by my being African-American-identified and his not being so, I snatched up this book among others on having a family; But this one I snatched up too quickly.This book proposes that even people in heavily industrialized nations should have three children per couple. This encouragement runs both against demographic trends and against common sense about resource usage. Demographic studies show that as countries grow more democratic and as education and opportunities are extended to women, population growth diminishes, to the point of, on average, just over two children per couple. People may not love children any the less in these cases or be acting any more selfishly than people in the Middle Ages when birth rates were higher. They are simply occupied with many activities that make life exciting and worth living. Also, sanitation and the availability of clean water and vaccines have helped reduce infant mortality and so reduce the need to have four or five or more children per family to increase the likelihood that some offspring will survive to reproductive age. Urbanization has also meant less need to create \"free\" farm hands by means of growing fetuses.Furthermore, the spreading knowledge about how industrialized nations more rapidly deplete resources than ever, so per capita resource use continues to climb and threatens those available for one's descendants has probably had some positive effect on industrialized peoples' attitudes. These peoples are becoming increasingly aware that the higher the per capita use and the higher the \"capita\" or head count, the lower the likelihood that descendents will experience a good life.This book both wants to counteract the demographic tendency and hates with all its little heart the increasing knowledge about resource depletion. For its counteractive desire and its boiling hatred of scientific knowledge about resource depletion, this book depends upon a peculiar metaphysical concept that holds that, no matter how many people are on the planet or in solar system or wherever, they, driven by the \"free market\" will find a solution, such as ever-new kinds of resources and how to exploit them, to any problem the species can ever encounter.This faith is such a blind one, it drops the jaw. The only justification it has is the fact that Malthus's predictions did not come out as predicted. The planet is still surviving, long after it was supposed to have been ravished to nothing by overcrowded humans.Therefore, the logic goes--since Malthus's prediction was off--it must be that overcrowding will never happen and humans no matter how numerous will always prevent problems of \"overcrowding\" by providing ingenious, happy solutions through the ingenious Magic Hand of the free market.Magic, indeed.This hypothesis is either A) unfalisifiable, or B) proven false only when it is too late, that is when there are too many billions of us and the resources are indeed depleted without the market's having provided any last-minute salvation. Alternatively, the unfalsifiability of it rests in the fact that apologists for the theory could continue indefinitely to promise that the free market is about the solve the problem any minute now. Similarly have cults kept their following growing ever-stronger, upon occasions when the messiah was supposed to reappear, by saying the messiah is coming actually on X date.The basis for this hypothesis derives partly from some 18th-Century thinkers inspired by the showballing enthusiasm for the Scientific Revolution's promise to give us a good grip on nature. Since then, both the sciences and market innovations, whether really free-market or not, have helped usher in many conveniences. But given that many of the long-promised solutions \"just around the corner,\" such as the cure to cancer and nuclear fusion, have yet to happen or even indicate how they will happen, there is at least as much, if not more, reason to doubt the faith in the market's ability to solve any problem humanity can ever face as to doubt that the population explosion will ever create a problem.Given merely the increasing evidence of global warming, ozone-layer depletion, and biodiversity depletion and the vast majority of scientists acknowledging these phenomena as facts and growing ever-more concerned about them, there is substantial reason to doubt the hypothesis's blind faith.It would not be within the confines of reason to follow this book's advice to add more industrialized capitas.One curious note about the book's peculiar assumptions. The book contends that parents really need not spend that much time with their children, even if there are three or more children in the family. On the one hand, the book implies that it is selfish not to have a good tussle of offspring. On the other hand, it is here appealing to a selfish tendency in industrialized cultures to want to spend less time with their kids. (Studies, astonishingly, show that people is these cultures put spending time with their kids low on their lists of pleasures, below things like exercising or eating out with friends.) So it seems we should only have kids, by this book's logic, to produce ever more many brains for the future to solve the problems that the presence of ever-more many brains (capitas) create.And--to further salve the consciences of those too busy to play with their kids--one need not worry about whether ignored kids will develop right. Genes do everything important, all on their own. Apparently, if Einstein had been left in solitary, featureless confinement in a cellar, with food passed under the door and never hearing a word spoken or seeing a thing in print, he would still have discovered general and special relativity. Curious faith, this book .", "overall": 2.0}

{"reviewText": "I was greatly offended by the subtle attempts of the authors to influence the students' opinion of socialism. Coupled with an explanation of how to influence people, it came across as indoctrination. They clearly had their own agenda and it wasn't to present objective information on how human beings behave.What these Californians desire is to see is an America where the people are completely disarmed and subject to the will and force of an elite few. They expect people to believe that a corrupt government, taxing people into the ground, and re-distributing wealth to people with more skin color will create a better world. What they are teaching is not true tolerance or equality, but a new form of prejudice that is thinly disguised as tolerance.It is apparent from their writings that they lack a firm grasp of Southern history, culture, and present day challenges-never-mind the principles the Unitied States Was founded on. They love to bring up racism and the South, but fail to explain the Civil War was started over tariffs, not slaves. Of course they're not going bring up the buildings built on top of slave graveyards in New York; that doesn't fit their southerners-are-the-devil agenda.They bring up violence in the South, but fail to mention that cities with the highest rates of gun crime are some in the north with the strictest gun control laws, like Chicago and Washington D.C. Why? The truth doesn't fit their agenda.I am a descendent of immigrants (legal immigrants) who learned to speak English. Expecting people to legally immigrate, speak English, and obey our laws isn't racism; it's law and order. It's easy for some city slickers from L.A. to call border security racism; they haven't had to live in a border town and be terrorized by the Mexican drug wars spilling over into the states.I could write an entire paper on how much these commies are full it, but it can be summed quickly; they are disguising a political agenda to transform the U.S. into something akin to the USSR as social agenda for false equality and tolerance. Anyone who doesn't agree with this agenda is labeled a racist, a bigot, or just another backwards southerner.

The only critique I could offer is that for people who are not familiar with toilet installations, the instructions are next to none.  How helpful it would be if the manufacturer added a small direction sheet so the novice would know the proper sequence in installation of the attachments to achieve a solid level seat.  My husband had no problems because he is familiar with such things but we both noted that a novice would not know the proper sequence for fasteners, which goes first, etc.  As for me, I am sold on this product as being exactly as described and far nicer looking than those available locally.  My main criteria was a solid seat, no shifting during movement, so the beautiful finish was just icing on the cake.  Great product and super packing .", "overall": 5.0}

The original addition of the figure is him without his jacket.The main issue I have is that he's not very articulated, and the facial sculpt is a little weird.

{"reviewText": "I honestly thought that this figure would be bigger, but it's only six inches high, and not the eight that is stated in the product specs. But either way, this figure is really cool, and a must for all Dragon Ball fans.I also honestly believed that this figure would be a hollow PVC when I bought it, but was thrilled when I discovered it was solid. It's quite heavy for a six inch figure.The figure comes in four pieces, (upper half, belt, legs, and base) and is fairly quick and easy to assemble. The sculpt on it is amazing for a six inch figure, and looks amazingly like Goku from the series; from the facial sculpt down to the details of the clothing. Even the locks of hair that hang down above his eyes are sculpted separately from his forehead. The sculptor's three-dimensional accuracy in capturing the two-dimensional art style of Akira Toriyama is not something I'm used to seeing, especially in a figure this size.The illustration that this figure was primarily sculpted from can be found on page 98 in the first Daizenshuu (Known as \"Dragon Ball: The Complete Illustrations\" in the United States). The only difference between the figure and the illustration in the book is that the kanji on the back of his gi are different. On the figure, we have the Kame Turtle symbol, which is the one that Goku is most synonymous with. The original illustration features the Kaio symbol, which Goku has during the late Saiyan arc into the early Freeza arc.This is the only figure from this line that I own, but I will most likely purchase more due to how good a quality that it is. I recommend this for any fan of the series, or a fan of anime in general .", "overall": 5.0}

This version of him is from his first appearance in the original Dragon Ball series, and not him from Dragon Ball Z.He comes in eight pieces:*Base*Upper half*Lower half*Head*Axe*Cape*Head Feather*Belt tieHe stands about seven inches tall from base to head feather. The only downside to this figure is that he's not to-scale when compared to the rest of the characters in this series. In the series, he's about three times the size of everyone else, but he's about the same size as the other characters in this line. In spite of this, I definitely recommend this figure for any true Dragon Ball fan .", "overall": 5.0}
{"reviewText": "This figure of Launch is really amazing, and is sculpted from the artwork of the first moment she appears in the series when she's being chased by the cops after a robbery.This figure stands about 5.5 inches tall from the bottom of the base to the top of her hair. The detail on the figure is incredible, even the money flying from the bag has a particular pattern on it, simulating a print.The figure comes in four pieces: Base, \"bike\", Launch's bottom half, and her top half. The figure is made primarily of solid PVC, but certain features such as the dust from the wheel and the light covers on the bike are made of translucent acrylic. The electrical control panel on the bike has even been painted to look as if it's displaying information.This is perhaps one of the only Launch statues and figures on the market, and even though I'm not particular toward her character, this figure has incredible detail and is worth the price .", "overall": 5.0}

Face plate is fairly cheap, was afraid I would break it when I put it on head unit, no joke.  Looks good in my truck, and was easy to install. This is the extent of positive things I have to say about it.  Screen stays blue all the time, no color changing or beat waves like many of its contemporaries have. Usb port in front is only good for thumb drives.  It advertises that it will work with I Phone and pods, and it does but with various expensive cords you have to buy separately.  My wife said it looks \" ghetto\".  DVD works fine, reads my Cd's as DVDs and won't play them.I don't usually write this kind of stuff, but I felt the need to worn others. I could have bought the Sony, or Pioneer from walmart for about the same price, and regret it every day!!!  I did some research about the brand and it got good reviews all and all, they must not have been talking about this head unit.  The owners manual is poorly written and at times it is not even spelled properly. Boss audios customer service is poor, and not very knowledgeable when it comes to this head unit. In short if you buy this head unit, don't expect much help from them.I don't think that Amazon and Boss have worked out some kind of \"scam\", and I'm going to see if I can return it tomorrow. I will let you know how it goes.I hope this helps and you all listen to this warning!!!!!!!Called BOSS and they could not help me, said it was a software problem and I needed to return it to AMAZON. Returned it to AMAZON and they will not give me my money back. Just to clarify AMAZON now has the headunit and my money, and I have nothing. Again don't by this head unit!!!!!! I am not so sure anymore that this is not a scam!!!!!!I bought this unit on 2/8/2013 new from AMAZON, to day is 3/6/2013!!!! Be warned!!!!!Afetr much argument and frustration I finally convinced AMAZON to return my money! I went out today and purchased a Kenwood KDC-200U, easy install, does exactly what it advertises, sounds great, and I am very happy.  If you wanted a head unit to read your Itunes files without having to mess with your phone, I would suggest this headunit. Tax and all I only payed $16.00 dollars more than the Boss and no problems at all. Even though it does not have the tiny screen on it I even think that the display looks better than the Boss.

{"reviewText": "This kit is sort of okay. Your hermit crabs needs are much larger than this kit provides for. I do not think this kit is all bad though. but many factors play into it. two things that greatly affect this is the size of your crab and how many crabs you have.but from reading the other reviews on this item, you may want to buy this ONLY for a tiny hermit crab.BUTTHE SPONGE -- your hermit crabs needs more than a sponge for its water source. Your hermit crabs needs a salt water DISH and a fresh DE CHLORINATED water dish. The crab needs to be able to climb in the dish and soak its body and clean out its shells. if you have a few different sized hermit crabs, you want to have either a sponge or empty shells to help your little guys climb in and out. hermit crabs should not be able to submerge their entire body and shell under the water. So make sure you have a dish safe for both water types and sufficient bowls to do so. I personally have found that my hermies love the Zoo Med Reptile Ramp Bowl. It has worked the absolute best for mine. I have a 20 gallon tank, 4 hermit crabs, (2 medium, 2 tiny). I ordered the Medium bowl. It is perfect for my bigger guys, but I have extra shells in there to help my little ones get in and out if they find themselves to deep.  ALSO sponges need to be cleaned often, I personally do not use them because they stay moist and are an object that can easily start mold. if you decided to go with sponges, I would boil them every two weeks or so, and replace them often. I have not had sponges in my crabitat for months and my hermit crabs do not miss them. They love their bath way more!SAND-- from the other reviews, you may want to be aware that the bag being sent is smaller than advertised. but in general, you need WAY MORE sand than this kit provides. There should be enough sand for your biggest hermit to dig down and completely burry himself. Depending on your hermit crabs size, you need 3\"-6\" of sand/substrate. This is very important for your hermit to be able to complete the molting process. If your hermit cannot complete this process, chances are, they will die. I am not exaggerating, please do not learn the hard way on this. I personally do not buy sand from pet stores. Plain old Play sand from Lowes is suitable for your hermits. you will want to spray the sand daily to keep it moist so the hermit crabs can borrow and create a molting hole. Also, misting your tank and sand can keep the humidity up, also another vital factor in hermit crab care. if you care about the color of the sand, then spend the money on this stuff. but you will pay three times the amount on colored sand. I bought a 5 pound bag of play sand for 3.49 this weekend. I put the whole bag in my 20 gallon tank. when I had a 10 gallon tank I also used the whole bag!SHELL FOOD DISHES & PELLET FOOD-- you will want and need more than a little shell for a food dish. but that does not mean this item is useless. I like the shell food dishes to hide throughout the tank with treats on them. Hermit crabs love peanut butter, put a little on this and hide it somewhere, you crabs will love discovering it later. but don't forget where you hid it, you don't want mold!!!! you should have a larger food dish for the fruit and veggies (and occasionally meat) that your hermit crab needs. Pellet food should not be the hermits main diet. I always give fruit and veggies along with a little pellet food because some of my little hermies like it. so don't think you need to throw away the dish or pellet food, but they are not enough to sufficiently take care of your hermit crabs.TWO SHELLS -- two shells is nowhere near enough shells for your hermit crab. if you have one crab, he should have at least 5 shells to choose from !!!AT LEAST!! I have 2 medium hermit crabs and have 20 shells for them to choose from. the last thing you ever want to find is a dead hermit crab and the other one walking around in the dead crabs old home. it is rather disturbing. if there are plenty of shells, fights are less likely to happen. Don't get me wrong, sometimes there is plenty of shells and one crab will still want another ones shell. that's life I guess. but two shells is not enough, but two is better than none or one.CLIMBING WALL-- I had the same climbing wall before too. the two small strips of Velcro do not hold it that great. I had 5 pounds of sand in the tank that held the climbing wall tightly to the side of the tank. But, this wall attracts mold easily. it holds in moisture which is good for humidity but if you get mold, it will continue to grow on this wall. just be careful that no crabbies find their way to the back of the wall and that you change food often to avoid mold. if you have the correct amount of sand then this wall should stay into place, if not, the Velcro will not be enough.THE HIDEOUT -- as I said before, you may only want this if you have a little tiny hermit crab. I personally have two small hermit crabs and I have a small coco hut like this one. They love it. And truthfully, I often find my larger crabs smooshing themselves in it too. If your hide out is above sand, the big guys will dig down to be able to fit inside. Its funny to watch them try to get their shells through the door, but I think this hide out will be just fine for all sizes, unless my crabs are just weird and like small spaces. I have four hermit crabs and I have 4 hideouts. All different sizes. Because if you do have a tiny hermit crab, you want a hide out so small your big ones cannot get into it. the small crab needs somewhere to go is he or she feels unsafe or bullied. Normally crabs get along just fine, they love friends, but they have cranky days too. I wouldn't worry to much, if your crab wants in, he will find a way in.This kit is okay to supplement a tank or to HELP get you started. but your hermit crab needs much much much more. please do some research to find out what you are missing or just plain do not know. I started out with very little ideal of what hermit crabs need because I was fed the same myth of hermit crabs needing a sponge, a little sand, and pellet food. after much research and reading, I have learned a great deal.  please go to www.hermit-crabs.com if you want to know more, I have found this site helped me a lot, there is tons of info on there from basic care to being able to tell if your hermit is a boy or girl.HAPPY CRABBING EVERYONE .", "overall": 3.0}

{"reviewText": "I've been a DJ for 8 years, played at a number of venues in Hollywood, I also do a lot of my mixing at home. I wish being a DJ was something I can do as a career but life isn't always the way you'd like it to be, nonetheless--I am passionate about EDM and still pump juicy 4step progressive/tech house in my home studio.Let's get one thing clear, the sony MDRV6/MDR7506 is always chosen over the XD-53 ONLY during my visit to studios and during my home studio, I will explain the reason for the choice and application.Both are accurate with tracking, great transparency, however--the sonys are more quick in timing, far more revealing in the lower-upper high frequency with a mid range that's just as close to perfect or ideal for mixing at home, preparing a set, producing and other applications in a studio environment, they have this wonderful sparkle. Another aspect that the sonys excel over the XD-53 is comfort, I don't think I need to elaborate the difference in comfort as everyone's head size/ear-to ear is different, but to give you an idea--an analogy would be a firm orange vs exotic Persian silk pillow.The 53's ace card is undoubtedly the reproduction in bass response. I'd like to note that these headphones have the largest drivers within the DJ headphone market. Additionally, these 53mm drivers are admirably hard to distort, I'm sure you can but at that level of volume you'd do more harm to yourself than get audio pleasure.I'd like to go into more detail about the bass. As loud and physically impactful these can get, they at no point--even with a much more complex track, do they bled into the other frequency or cloud the working elements of midrange and highs. The bass just hits gloriously hard in its own space and time allowing me to dissect and break down a track with ease and haste. The decay, quality, and it's accuracy at loud volumes makes these almost absolutely require in a club compared to other DJ phones. Again In a club, not at a home studio.By now, you can clearly see where the sony and the 53s are special in their own right. While I can use the 53s at home, I found the sonys to be a lot more enjoyable as well as having the edge in my studio. With electronic music, it's crucially important to listen to the snares, hi-hats,cymbals of the track you are cueing up to present it through your monitors and as important as bass is in that aspect, I believe the instruments I've mention are more important for a silky, grain-free, and harmonic blending and transition within the mix. But, I wouldn't use the sonys at a club, I'd have a hard time judging the bass of the cue track, this will cause me to turn up the headphone which would end up hurting my ears and a quicker fatiguing of the ear from its upper frequencies.So if you are a resident DJ every weekend at a club or would like to enjoy legendary bass that's clean, accurate with impactful enough to shake your vision( exaggerated, only the Audeze LCDs yield this type of godly bass ) mixing at home, then the XD-53 is obviously the choice. But if you are nit-picky and has to have brutally(in a good way)honest midrange and high frequency, the mdrV7 and 7506 will not disappoint, it gets the job done in spades.So basically, for me, I need both. Lol, sorry about your wallet. Cheers .", "overall": 5.0}

{"reviewText": "I work as a smog check inspector in the state of California, in California there are more vehicles than there are of human beings. So depending on the station's service, price, etc the number of cars may vary. I for one, work at a shop that has a high volume of cars that come in per day, typically around 15-18 cars daily. Doing 15-18 smog checks on my own is quite a bit of work on the feet.My review directly reflects on the performance of these boots while on the job:Comfort - Prior to owning this particular Timberland work boots, Ive used Caterpillar, Bates, and Wolverine. I preferred Wolverines as they offered the 'Contour Welt' technology for great comfort, especially for long hours--I felt they were the most comfy of all. Im happy to say that these Timberland PRO work boot is far superior in terms of comfort and 'end of the day' results, I honestly thought boots cannot be anymore comfortable than what the Wolverine Buccaneer and Raider models offered. When I first slipped these on and tied the laces on both feet, it felt as if my feet were pillowed by some exotic Persian fabric and padding. These boots are ridiculously comfortable to wear, the best by far.Performance - Here again, prior to these, I felt that Wolverine outperformed the competition with their 'Multishox' feedback or energy return technology. But against these, there's just no comparison. Timberland's 'Anti-Fatigue' technology is like walking on cloud-nine, the energy returned or 'bounce' is amazing, it allows you to maneuver quickly, safely, and with grace without a hint of discomfort. Another excellent feature these boots have is their 'Electrical Hazard Protection', on their website it states that these boots meet ANSI Z41PT99, ASTM F2412-11, ASTM 2413-11 and F2892-11 standards to provide protection from open circuits. I do not know what all those actually mean, all I know and care about is the fact that I do not get shocked/static from touching any metal surface after going in and out of customers vehicles on a windy day. Don't you hate that, when you get in your vehicle, drive to a gas station to fill up, and you get a jolt of static electricity while closing the door? This happens because the shoes you are wearing are of rubber, a great static build up material as your shoes are touching the fabric floor mat. With these, I can work worry free of those deadly static shocks I used to get 100x a day, I can literally rub these boots on carpet for 10mins and touch you without shocking you! How awesome is that...This review has gotten longer than I wanted yet I can go on and on about how wonderful they are, but I wont, Ill let the product speak for itself. I highly recommend these boots, excellent value, and of course--buy with confidence with Amazon .", "overall": 5.0}
{"reviewText": "In my opinion, Digweed's material is tougher to actually 'understand' or 'feel' over what most International superstar DJs offer in terms of style/flavor. I always get the \"who's that?\" when I mention Digweed to someone who  claims to love EM, and it baffles my mind that they have no clue as to who he is and what he has accomplished. I believe they have a much better chance of understanding his style if they saw him live at a club and not at a rave or from a CD. Then again, not everybody enjoys the wildly dark and haunting progressive house this man possesses. But really, how can one not..?LIA is the lastest release from the \"Live in\" series yet it sets itself on another level. Live in London was good, really really good--prior to this I felt that the London release was Digweed's finest mix. However, with LIA there is absolutely nothing wrong with the entire 1-4 Discs. These 4 Discs are filled with real quality tracks that had me grinning, scratching my head and glued to my 5,000.00 headphone rig for the entire 4+hours. Its so properly done with his signature style of dark, tech, progressive house it is undoubtedly the best mix any DJ has ever created, possibly for the next 10 years. The track selection is simply a work of art and Im convinced that Mr.Digweed is not human but of something else.Digweed appears to always be at his prime but 2013 was particularly his year, releasing some of the finest albums, LIA being the best. For those of you who thought that \"Live in London\" was the best, be sure to audition this one--I'm sure you'll agree. You'll have a hard time deciding which of the 4 Discs you like best, every Disc envelopes you completely and differently.I originally wanted to purchase this album with Beatport in higher than MP3 quality but Beatport is seriously greedy with money. If you want the album in WAV format which is essentially 16/44 or CD quality, you'll be asked to pay an insulting price of 63.00. Obviously this album's value is more but you can order with Amazon which gets you a actual CD--all 4 Discs AND even a free MP3 version download. Shame on you Beatport, shame on you..

{"reviewText": "I was worried these boots would not be as attractive as I was hoping, but they were even cuter than portrayed online! I love them. They are perfect winter boots. Stylish, durable and warm. One of my favorite things is that you can easily rinse them off if they get muddy. My only critiques are that they are super stiff at first. So stiff they are hard to walk in and heavy so that they hurt your ankles. When I am walking it feels like I am stomping around. It takes some getting used to it. They are also a bit difficult to drive in. The first time I wore them I wore ankle socks with them, and they rubbed the back of my ankle and almost gave me a blister. Now I wear leg warmers and rain boot liners with them and it is no longer a problem and even more stylish. They are warm and toasty, but almost too toasty. I wore them when it was 50 degrees and they were too warm, and my feet are always cold. They are hard to get off, but it gets easier every time. I think once I have them all broken in they will be just fine. I never want to take them off. They are very adorable boots. Perfect with skinny jeans or tights and a dress. I plan to wear them forever. I am obsessed with boots. I have many pairs, but these are my favorite. I don't know if I will ever take another pair out of the closet.

I can't get the contact list to properly download and be stored in the memory. It does memorize your most recent calls and puts them in as your &#34;Favorite Contacts&#34;. I have tried with various Android phones and none seem to work. The battery seems to last a good amount of time. Love that it turns itself off/on when you get in and out of the car. Can also easily be converted back to phone if you don't want it to be on the speaker.  Although it doesn't come with a house charger--your cell phone charger works as well with it so it doesn't have to be charged in the car.

They  are responsive and comfortable to hold. Often i find myself reaching for this over my wireless Dualshock. If you have controllers and want to round out your numbers, or just need new ones this is a pretty good one to go with. I have had them for a few months now, with no problems as of yet. {No button sticking, no buttons going out} For the price and quality. They are a steal for me. Keep in mind these are not wireless. That's the only downside i can think of, but that really depends on who's using them., I'm so used to wireless that i keep forgetting they they are not wireless. I often jump up with them still in my hand, yanking them straight out of the ps3. So yeah... Will pick up a couple of extra's just in case .", "overall": 5.0}
{"reviewText": "I had never played any Disgaea game before, Mostly all the guys i game with wants to either shoot you in the back, or smash you into a wall and speed off. I never actually heard of Disgaea until this year (and that's only because of Amazon recommending it to me) I like all types of games not just one in particular. So i'm not stuck in any one genre of gaming. What made me buy this game was 3 things. The first thing was  from the photos on amazon i saw. It made me think of FF tactics gameplay. And it's very similar to that, but with it's own style and variations. Will a fan of FF tactics like this game,I'm leaning more towards maybe, but not necessarily. This game is good on it's simple humor, but sometimes the humor can be a bit of a turnoff for those looking for a deeper more serious storyline. While everything that tries to be funny in game, isn't always funny, i did have a few simple laughs and a smile or two here and there. While being amusing, It's simply just not for everyone, but no game is you know. The second reason was that i looked up a video of it on youtube,  It showed  some of the special moves, team attacks and, the character creation screens, and that made me go, ...kay may be something to this game. You have a huge class of guys to choose from.Magic types, Brawler types, types in between and things that are just crazy. They are all demons or related to demons in one way or another. The third and final reason that i went with this game was because of it's reviews. But let me warn the graphic seekers out there. The sprites here do look great , but it isn't anything that will blow your mind. Now if you don't like turn based tactical rpg's, you won't like this game at all. It would be a complete waste of your time and money, but mostly, your money. Because you wouldn't play this long at all. But if you like any tactics styled rpg game, then you'll have a good time here with Valvatorez and his crew of misfits .", "overall": 4.0}

Works great on time crisis razing storm and Dead Storm pirates but very unresponsive on Time Crisis 4. The same goes for the house of the dead, works great on hod 4 but on hod 3 and overkill it isn't able to keep up with manual trigger fire. It does it's best when it's played on games that have auto fire, which requires you to pull and hold the trigger once to keep firing.It's a great gun with that considered.

{"reviewText": "When the first BlazBlue came out, it was a great game. It had a lot going for it. Even with a somewhat small roster of characters. It actually had a good story, which is hard to come by in a lot of fighting games. But it's not really about the story, it's about finding a favorite character, and beating down anyone or anything that gets in your way on or offline. But now after playing this third installment, i'm getting a bit tired of the whole blazblue universe. on the good side of things you get all dlc characters from continuum shift and an art book of pictures from the first blazblue. And they changed the system voice again, and man, that's a bad thing, You can download better voices for 6 bucks online. Which is bs. Gameplay wise it's great and graphic wise it is good looking like always. If you never played blazblue before, and you like 2d fighting games you'll love this. If you have played blazblue before, you'll more then likely love this. But for me, it's not the same excitement as when i first played the original blazblue. The story has become a bit tiresome and it's time for me to move on past future releases. But for fans of blazblue you'll love this one .", "overall": 4.0}

{"reviewText": "First copyrighted in 1958, Elie Wiesel's Nobel Peace Prize winning novel \"Night\" is all about the Holocaust and his experiences. The book includes the accepted speech by Wiesel and a new preface by the author. The author's intention of writing the book was clearly to inform the people of today of his experiences and the reality of the holocaust while the New York Times calls the novel \"A slim volume of terrifying power.\"Night starts out in Sighet, Transylvania where the author talks about his family and a foreign Jew called Moishe the Beadle, who taught Wiesel all about Kabbalah. Moishe, along with the other foreigners, get expelled from Sighet and are taken to Hungary to dig trenches that are later used as their own graves. Moishe amazingly survives, escapes, and is able to make his way back home to Sighet. Later, in 1944 Wiesel was taken from his home to Auschwitz, then to Buna, to finally be taken to Buchenwald. There, at sixteen, Wiesel lost his father to Dysentery and later fell ill himself. He had already lost his mother and younger sister, Tzipora, and was now alone. With no reason to keep living, Wiesel miraculously survived.Night is the perfect example of a true heart-wrenching story with a first person view to get the reader feeling as if they were really there. All throughout \"Night\" you will see many themes displayed, however keeping faith would be a major one. During the holocaust many Jewish faiths were tested; is there a God? Is there not a God? The author's overall thesis would be reminding people of the true horrors of the holocaust. Wiesel describes his very own horror stories throughout the novel with \"From the depths of the mirror, a corpse was contemplating me\" (Wiesel, 115) and other chilling metaphors.If you would love a true inside look on the Holocaust, \"Night\" is the perfect book for you. Though it lacks very much description, the author uses plenty of unique similes and metaphors to keep the writing alive. A great example of one the similes the Wiesel uses is \"Monday went by like a small summer cloud, like a dream in the first hours of dawn.\" The author also puts true feeling into his writing and thoroughly explains each point in the Holocaust.Along with the Nobel Peace Prize, Wiesel has also won the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the United States of America Congressional Gold Medal, and the French Legion of Honor. He is also the Andrew W. Mellon Professor in the Humanities and University Professor at Boston University. Elie Wiesel is the author of more than forty other novels including \"Dawn\" and \"Day\" to complete the \"Night\" trilogy. You can find all three of these books at Amazon.com for $12.07, or at Barnes and Noble you can find \"Night\" at $8.98 for paperback and $15.14 for hardcover. You can also find it on your NOOK for $7.99 or on your Kindle for $4.99. \"Night\" is also available for audio-cover at $14.39 .", "overall": 5.0}

In fact, I actually liked it so much I read it three times at various times throughout my life.Every one wants pro's and con's, but I honestly have no 'cons' in regard to this book. If you like time travel based sci-fi in any form, then I can almost guarantee you'll love this book.As to the other reviewer who said they read this book in a day, I would simply assume they read everybook in a day. It's not a short book at all, unless you compare it to 'Dune' maybe, but otherwise it's a meaty book that will keep you thinking as you read it. Then again, I like to savor good books on the journey reading them, and this was one of them.Well worth the time for any time travel fan .", "overall": 5.0}
{"reviewText": "Well, I wouldn't normally read this kind of story (ya, I know that's probably what they all say,) but I saw Miss Kitts name on it, so I knew it would be at least a good read. What I didn't expect though, was to actually LOVE this hot story! Like I said, perhaps it's not my thing, but after today... well, let's just say I may read more of it! I was engrossed after the first page, totally into it. The author writes in a way I can only say will touch you in 'all' the right places ('velvet sleeve'... wonderful.) It has a great build up, and I couldn't wait for... you know... 'that' scene, and it didn't disappoint! Ohh la la! Well worth it in my view .", "overall": 5.0}
{"reviewText": "The lead character in this story, Tracy, is a waitress. But she's not your usual 'billionaire fodder' that just throws herself at a rich man. Having been in an accident, she develops the ability to enter the hot billionaire's dreams, and she finds the real reason why he never stays with just one woman. He needs something, but Tracy is 'the only one' who knows what that is, and she cleverly uses this to her advantage, so they both end up with the passion and relationship they want!I'm glad to see a story with a female character who isn't completely stupid for a change. It gets old reading about girls who just fall over themselves when they get a little attention from a handsome and muscular billionaire. I liked the way the author made Tracy into a dominant force. In fact, there is a great deal of power-play between the two of them, so it's not like this is just a 'dominant female' kind of story. It is a VERT HOT story, and by that I mean the author definietly knows what the reader is looking for (and I certainly found it!)I'd recommend this to anyone looking for a really steamy read, and a great twist in billionaire erotic romance books .", "overall": 5.0}
{"reviewText": "I'm used to reading erotic romance that is just quite 'meh', I've gotten so used to it that when I actually come across something written like this, it really kind of excites me. The descriptions of the characters and situations are so detailed that I felt pulled into their world. The main character is mysterious and sexy (look out for the descriptions of his hot body!) and everything flows well, and the sex scenes I LOVED!The main characater Sarah is also quite intriguing, and there is a lot of depth to her. I mean, she's been obsessed with this guy for so long, yet had never dared speak to him, but when he rescues her, well, there's so just so much more to him that she finds out. I don't like to be spoon-fed when I read a book, I like the author to credit me with at least enough intelligence to be able to use my own mind and not have to spell everything out for me, and this author definitely does that, and does it well!In short, it's well worth your time and I'll be looking forward to seeing what happens next. Great read, Hot hot hot .", "overall": 5.0}
{"reviewText": "The story begins with Cameron Seacrest, a woman who has just hit her thirtieth birthday; and although a successful owner of a nightclub, she has realized she is missing one thing: A child. Putting out an ad for the perfect donor - realizing she may not meet Mr. Right anytime soon - she sets up a meeting with a smoky blue-grey eyed hunk called Sam.The author sets up the meeting and the characters really well, with a great perspective from the males point of view and Camerons point of view. Usually, most authors fail to do one or the other with skill, depending on their sex. But not in this case. There's also a lot of humor and some great sexy moments (before the other 'sexy' moments, I'm sure you know what I mean.) There are also smatterings of rich tension throught the story, which is great, not to mention a fair few twists and turns along the way that kept me involved right up to the end. In short, this is well worth your time. It's so much better than what I had expected, and I'll definitely be reading much more of Miss Towers work .", "overall": 5.0}
{"reviewText": "I picked this book up on a whim, never having read any of the authors work before, and was more than pleasantly surprised! It's the story of Ethan (he's the hot one!) and Cat, a girl who's father has recently died. This story has a really good back story going on, and it's not just one of those that you know exactly what's going to happen (I mean, there are certain 'things' you definitely know will happen, and do, quite a few times!) The descriptions of Ethan just make him to die for, and the author really brings everyone to life so you feel they are right there with you... which is a good thing with tall handsome cowboys, if you ask me. This isn't a short work either, so you get into the whole setting and really get to know the characters. I didn't regret this impulse purchase at all, and in fact, will be reading much more of this authors work in the future .", "overall": 5.0}

It's very descriptive, and you get  whole sense of time, place and the characters. I liked the whole atmosphere the author was able to conjure up. The contrast between the city girl and the rugged cowboy is also nice (and sexy!) With the beautiful scenery the author paints so well, it's hard not to imagine yourself doing the same as the lead female character (and when you read the descriptions of the settings and testosterone filled Cowboy, you'll know what I mean!)The passion is undeniable, and if you want a hot steamy escapist read, then this is probably the one for you!

At first I thought she wasn't going to kill them but I'm glad she does, well only one so far.  Oh the book should make men everywhere a little more afraid of women.

I think it should have just been a book about the relationship before and have the second one  about 7 years later. I think that would have made more sense Ana would have been less hassle for us readersBut all that aside, this is still a great series and storyline.

I found the plot to be completely at odds with all logic and reason one would expect from a work so popular with women. The author romanticises abuse of women, schizophrenic episodes, Grey's being abused as an adolescent, irrational behaviour, stalker tendencies and any number of other huge character flaws simply because he is good looking and rich.....how he became a quasi billionaire by his late 20's... Well the author more or less lets the reader decide.Frankly the entire book leads the reader on a long, slow, death by a thousand wounds type journey that goes nowhere..... At no point could I say I was 'into' the book and I never had the tendency to burn the midnight oil and turn another page. I found the character and plot gaps far too large to be accounted for simply because this is a work of fiction.....And oft felt conflicted within myself to even complete the book.I'd think long and hard about putting my worst enemy through its 500 pages.... Erotica will more than take the place of this book in terms of plugging a 'gap' if that's what's whetted ones appetite. Steer clear at all costs .", "overall": 1.0}

I needed to keep reading. I wasn't disappointed at all. I never read the first one in the series and being as this is a standalone if was fine. I loved the storyline.Skye, our leading lady is dealing with a recent breakup when one of her best friends takes her out to get out of her funk. No one knows the details of her breakup and being the daughter of a politician she wants to keep it that way. She is beautiful, sophisticated and confident. I really liked that about her. While out with her friend she has a crazy encounter with a sexy and mysterious guy. Of course she can't get him out of her head and when he walks into her new job...Landon is gorgeous, headstrong, determined and yes, sexy! He's worked his way to get to where he was. He made sure to stay true to his roots, be domineering when he had to be and also just be an all-around great guy! After a crazy night out and a girl that he can't forget, he heads to work.Both realizing who the other was tantalizing and endearing. Of course they had to draw lines and not get involved. Neither could forget and neither wanted too.There is so much sexual tension between the two that you can't help rooting for them to get it on! You slowly watch as these two realize that there is more than to it than that and when outside inference starts to really mess things up you want growl in anger.Will they get their happily ever after? Will Skye's private life from her past ruin everything? Will Landon be able to truly give his heart to someone and settle down?You'll just have to read and find out!

Interesting though that the notes are not made by those who did the original designs, so I do wonder if these comments were added to the english, or if the Japanese version also has them, and also who wrote them and why?I haven't read all of the Japanese version but the translation seems very solid.As a fan of the Zelda games I think this book is a must have, has it has so much extra information about each game and now that I have it I like this cover better than the Japanese version.

It took 5&#34; to grind 17 lbs of venison trim. It would bog down a bit when the pork was a little fatty but still did a fine job. Felt the side of machine to check if it was getting hot but was only warm which is normal.  We did not try stuffing with the machine since we already had a bigger stuffer. But if we were to use it I would be concerned about the length of the tubes that were supplied, seemed a bit short (only 4&#34;).

This book is great for any age group; it speaks to those who are going to be experiencing the trial and tribulations of college.

I liked how he included goals for you to reflect on and the goals to start striving towards to make all of your dreams and goals become reality.  I also liked how he was able to speak freely about his life experiences and still maintain a positive attitude even when he felt like he was at his lowest points in his goals. He went through many trials and tribulations through his life that was expressed in this book and each time he was tested he was able to move forward with a positive attitude and he was still able his dreams become reality.

If you have medications you take then you should read this book before you go test.  I had the knock down and did not have the information needed to fight this situation and boy did it come in handy.  Great book for anyone that has to take a drug test of any kind for any reason.  Its one of those books you can't put down, the info in it  has knowledge the general public should know long before you go take a drug test.  For those that have to take prescription medication its a must.  Every Cold Medicine in your house can make you Fail your test.  But if you go in for that test knowing what I know NOW because of this book, then you shouldn't have any PROBLEMS.  All because of some sinus medicine I was taking I lost a job I had landed after being off work for 1 1/2 years and had a sinus infection going on when I went to test had been taking OTC sinus medicine I was knocked down .", "overall": 5.0}

{"reviewText": "How can I truly do justice with my words to review what is contained in this book? This account is a treasure for Humanity.I have had the utmost privilege and blessing of meeting Alter in person at his home. I was so very impressed with his vibrant Joy for life, despite the incredible odds he has faced. His insights and wisdom are remarkable. Yet he is so very humble, truly a Angel on Earth. His message is one that should be examined, pondered, and applied to all our lives. Anyone that reads this story will be uplifted, encouraged, and most importantly be grateful for what he or she has. There's a old Persian proverb that says &#34;I cursed the fact I had no shoes, until I met a man who had no feet&#34;. The Shoah (The Holocaust) should never be forgotten. It's lessons of despicable Evil, teach us to watch for and most importantly fight Evil where ever it may be. Evil spreads like a plague of sickness in the land unless treated by Good men and women. As Alter so poignantly put's it &#34;Ignorance is the Enemy of the World&#34;. Be not ignorant, I implore you to read with the greatest desire that your life might be enriched as it has mine by this book. Indeed there were many times when the outside world could have stopped many atrocities during WWII but nothing was done. How can men stand idly by and do nothing when others suffer? It's a age old question. Let me share with you one of my very favorite quotes of all history; &#34;The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing&#34; Edmund Burke. We are responsible to Humanity to do something, to raise up a standard of civility, benevolence, charity, peace, and understanding. So many great minds, souls, and hearts were lost in the tragic Holocaust. We must not let this happen ever again! If we don't educate ourselves we will most assuredly fall for the same traps and prejudices as the Nazi's. Every person should study this book! A account that paradigm shifts your reality! I am so very grateful to Alter for sharing his life with us and helping us to understand such precious truths!To Alter,Thank you for opening my eyes to a greater degree. For helping me increase my capacity for compassion and understanding. Your faith, strength, and spirit will always live on through the countless lives you have touched! Your influence reaches into eternity and will never cease! &#34;How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace; that bringeth good tidings of good, that publisheth salvation; that saith unto Zion, Thy God reigneth!&#34; Isaiah 52:7 I look forward to the day my brother that we are in the rest of God and can put away all darkness among us!

{"reviewText": "We just found the Superyard & received it this week. At night & some other times our 2 house bunnies need to be kept contained & away from danger. We got 2 of these pens to put together for a larger area, & we plan to add more. The space between the bars is enough for her to slip through & him to stick his head out, so we found some great wire mesh shelving to fit flat against the lower half. It's easy to put the fence into various shapes. The Superyard is so sturdy that I can see how a child up to 24 months would be safe if the gate is locked. The fence is attractive in our home, & with the additional fences I can go in with them to play. They love it & so do we. The folding brass-colored fencing we have is not attractive & it doesn't lock in place. It's great to have this really nice Superyard .", "overall": 5.0}

{"reviewText": "We bought this bassinet for our City Versa. Our baby is 2 months old and we have used it really extensively. In fact, we use this bassinet for our baby to sleep through the entire day and we push stroller from one room to another, making it a very functional day-bed for our little girl. If we put canopy down, she is much more cozy there than in a crib or the co-sleeper we have and especially in the beginning this was basically be the only place where she wanted to sleep (...or on mommy's lap!).We wonder why we did not think about getting a stroller with a bassinet for our first child - it made our life so much easier and I really recommend it.Pros:- very easy to attach to and remove from a stroller- great canopy and style, nice fabric-  very comfortable- easy to use for walks or for sleepingCons:- I wish it came with some sheets that I could change since we use it so extensively. We put blanket to cover the bottom.- I don't think you can remove the  fabric for wash. It could be a good option to have but washing it with a sponge has worked so far .", "overall": 5.0}

It made our life so much easier. We bought an optional bassinet that comes with City Versa and so far we have used it only with this bassinet since my baby is 2 months old. I will write an update once we use the included seat. Overall I really recommend this stroller!Pros:- VERY easy to fold and relatively light- fits in our trunk easily although we have a relatively small Nissan- great color and style - it got many compliments already!- very easy to maneuver- great basket - it is big and nicely placed- handle is easy to adjust and comfortable ( I am quite tall!)- the hand break is much better than foot break I had in other strollers - so easy to use!- most important: it is comfortable for a baby, my baby girl absolutely loves being in it, and she  sleeps in it most of the time during a day - it is much more cozy for a newborn than any bedCons:- included wheels are great (they ride smooth and are light) but they got bit worn down by little stones that pinched through them a little - it is only cosmetic detail. Probably more sturdy wheels would make the stroller much heavier.- I wish that belly bar was included with the purchase and at least a cup holder or some sort of organizer for a parent .", "overall": 5.0}

Also, the blocks are able to connect to one another except some of them do not seem to click and are lose.  Yet some of the blocks connect perfectly fine.I can say in my 1 year olds eyes its perfect.

{"reviewText": "Book 1 - Resisting the Bad BoyViolet Duke does an amazing job bringing to life characters you just fall in love with. Sweet sweet Abby has absolutely no idea what she is about to get herself into when Connor comes back into her life. There is no doubt these two are attracted to each other. This book has just the right mixture of love, seriousness, humor and raw sexual tension that you will be completely glued to it. This book won't leave you disappointed.Book 2 - Falling for the Good GuyThis book had me upset. I expected Abby to do what she does but it still upset me. I mean, what's a girl to do after what happened? What would you do?I fell more in love with all of them the more I read. Abby is a good hearted person and someone you can depend on to be there in the worst time. Connor does something unexpected at first but very admirable. *Swoon* Brian has been dealt a crappy hand at life but keeps his head on straight and is a good man.This book is full of friendship, more humor, love and a truck load of emotional-ness! Another lovely book!Book 3 - Choosing the Right ManIf this story couldn't get any better I'd be okay with it, but it is just THAT good!Connor come back and he's not going to just sit this one out without a fight. Brian doesn't plan on letting go of Abby all that easily either. If you are looking for a rollercoaster ride, then here it is.This book is so emotional you feel as one with Abby as goes down the path of making the choice between the man she knows she shouldn't want at all and the man that's been her best friend for ever. I was speechless with the whole story. I couldn't formulate words to describe how I felt, and I was just a reader. In my mind I knew who I wanted Abby to be with but I was hurting for the one she didn't choose. This book I have to say is the best of all three. It was the perfect ending to a wonderful story with beautiful characters .", "overall": 5.0}

With just getting over the fact that the next person he wanted to be with after getting over this loss picked his brother over him, he finds he is always the nice guy.

She dresses is crazy fashion, does whatever she feels at any given moment and isn't shy about saying what she thinks. She is what some would call a workaholic also spending any free time helping her friends and volunteering. Tessa is a baker and understands the way Brian feels about the loss of his wife. Brian suggests they have an affair, she agrees hoping her heart doesn't get involved.I completely loved this story. This isn't a simple love story at all.

{"reviewText": "I purchased this so I could get some kind of natural cleanse and detox without having to fast. I purchased the 5 day cleanse but haven't had the right time or the desire to fast for 5 days. This one may not be \"ultimate\" but it works rather well. I took 2 of each tablet in the morning and 2 of each at night. However, you will be hitting the bathroom at some unexpected moments, so keep that in mind! The first day, it may take 3 or 4 hours or more to kick in, but after a few days it's like clockwork. An hour or so after taking the pills and eating, you will hit the bathroom. I would suggest not taking it too late at night because you will wake up and need to run to the bathroom. I made that mistake more than once. So, if you have a bathroom available throughout the day, no long commutes or needing to find a bathroom, then give it a try! I had to stop it off and on because of my schedule, a couple of days off, then started up again. That's a plus for this product too.I feel less bloated, and I don't have bad gas from eating certain foods like usual - iron rich foods, etc. It definitely helps with cleansing the system, but not sure about the detoxification part of it. I'm not sure what signs to look for. I purchased another box to do again after I take a break off of it for a month or so.

It also means that the actions take an actual amount of time, for example if you give your sim a job it actually takes them 6 or so hours for them to go to work. If you tell them to watch a movie it takes them 90 actual minutes to watch it. It's just very stressful, I live a very stressful life and I don't have time to play everyday so by the time I get time to play my Sims are near death.

{"reviewText": "If you're a RPG player with kids, this is a great way to introduce them to your hobby. Based on L. Frank Baum's books, characters, and concepts, this is a fun and simple role-play game that really seems to make the most of Baum's ideas. Granted, it's no hack-and-slash dungeon crawl, but the Oz books have a lot of interesting ideas to offer. The author clearly likes the Oz setting and seems to have done some research into the books to make this game.I bought the paper version and it was worth the money. It's not a long book, but the point of role-playing is to use your imagination and I think it accomplished that. It's a great resource for players of all ages to explore the land of Oz. Since the combat is bloodless, it will also challenge longtime role-players to rethink their ideas and actually use their imaginations. As I aid, this is a great idea for younger player who want to have fantasy adventures of their own but might not be ready for complex rules systems or combat laden adventuring .", "overall": 5.0}
{"reviewText": "Four films on one DVD! Every Oz fan should add this to their collection. The films differ in length, but they are well-preserved and look great. These films predate the 1939 musical with Judy Garland and are, quite honestly, nothing like it.  I think I paid around $8 for this and would gladly have spent more for it.I read other reviews that complain that there is no sound and a lot of reading. That would be because these are silent movies from the early 1900's. Despite what the box art would have you believe, they are not in color. I, personally, like them better in black and white. L. Frank Baum himself made three of these films and, since he wrote the books, I enjoyed seeing his work in a new medium where he had control of the production. The 1925 \"Wizard of Oz\", made after Baum died in 1919, is a completely different interpretation of the story, even going so far as to change some of the characters and plot lines. Fans of \"alternate reality/history\" storylines might find this to be a fun, if strange, interpretation of Mr. Baum's famous work.My regret is that the 1910 version of \"Wonderful Wizard of Oz\" isn't on here, but the Oliver Hardy 1925 version is included so I can't be upset about it. Plus, it was on the 2-disc DVD release of the 1939 film(Wizard Oz Two Disc 70th AnniversaryOtherwise, this was a fun trip to OZ through the eyes of the author and a strange re-imagining of the \"Wizard of OZ\" with Oliver Hardy not being able to blame Stan for his predicaments. If you like Oz stories or silent films, this is definitely worth checking out .", "overall": 5.0}
{"reviewText": "Although Phil Schneider is giving the speech on the DVD, he never really goes into any detail about the so-called alien/human war that he was allegedly involved in at Dulce, NM. I thought that would have been something included since it's mentioned on the box. There is absolutely no evidence to support any claim of an alien &#34;war&#34; or the supposed casualties that occurred. It is only mentioned, briefly in passing, once or twice before he goes back to rambling about technology. This is more of a conspiracy-oriented lecture with little evidence beyond Mr. Schneider's statements. Viewers interested in UFOs will find little, if anything, new. The information is extremely dated at this point (he references the stealth bombers a lot, but still doesn't really go anywhere with the information) and the lecture seems very scattered and disorganized. It's aimed at true believers and not the undecided viewer or the casual viewer. The conspiratorial aspects felt like rambling most of time and more than once I felt the urge to pause the movie to look for some tinfoil to construct a hat with.The only mentions of Mr. Schneider's death and the possible cover-up of it are on the back of the box. It is never addressed in the film itself. I thought there would be some form of supporting evidence or discussion of that, but nothing is in there. Making accusations is pointless if you aren't going to investigate it or tell me more about it than a few paragraphs on the box. Where are the Freedom of Information Act requests for the autopsy and police reports? Copies of letters? Interviews with friends and family members that believe that he was murdered? Much like Mr. Schneider's credentials and evidence, those things are not in this film.While the back of the box information is not in the film, neither is any tangible evidence. A few photos from magazines and books and rehashed mentions of covert government bodies that may or may not exist seem to be the only thing in the way of evidence. Yes, he has some rocks, but we never get to see them up close (or even photos of them). The camera operator seems to have fallen asleep during that part because the zoom feature on his/her camera seems to operate rather randomly.Also, the audio is pretty awful at times because it was filmed in what appears to be a community room at a local library or convention center. People occasionally move in front of the camera and the camera operator was, at best, lazy or completely unskilled. An editor would have been helpful, too.If you're not a must-have collector of UFO or conspiracy stories, then this probably isn't for you. Certainly don't pay more than the price of a bad movie. This just didn't add anything new to UFOlogy .", "overall": 2.0}

Billy Ray Cyrus made for an interesting choice for the film. some people have criticized it but they must not have watched this documentary. I thought he did a great job.If you're looking for another re-hash of the Civil War, this is not for you. It has nothing to do with it. Honestly, I was a little glad the producers skipped that. The Civil War has been covered in a lot of other documentaries and this was not the venue for it.I'd love to see a sequel. I'm sure there are more stories out there that they couldn't fit in.

However, I do know for sure that the lamp in my office being on somehow caused interference with the mic. Turning off my lamp, and disabling AGC made the sound quality excellent. There is still a minor &#34;Air&#34; noise that can be heard in the silence due to the mic's sensitivity, but nothing a little noise removal in Audacity can't fix in an instant.After many hours of frustration and troubleshooting...

{"reviewText": "This book is extremely dull. The case questions don't really seem to get the idea of systems analysis in one's head. The layout is clumsy and hard to understand, and the book is ridiculously priced. $160? For a paperback? This is crazy; you can do all the research online for free! In all my time of using Pearson, Pearson publishers create boring books filled with typos and overpriced textbooks. Do not buy this book; rent if you need it. You will save /so/ much money!Updated November 7, 2013I am more than halfway through the course, and the book is not very good. It seems to only tell you /what/ the steps are in each chapter, not /how/ to do them. One would think you would need both, but, as with most of the Pearson books, it does not. I would suggest that all users of the textbook use it as told, but be prepared to do a good amount of online research .", "overall": 1.0}

{"reviewText": "I am going to start by saying I am using a Phenom II X6 1055T, so I do not know if FX processors will have the same issue I have. I also cam from a Gigabyte 890FXA-UD5 looking to upgrade to Vishera on the cheap.Pros:It is actually a nice board, I like the layout and the extended ESP12V power connector make plugging in the power connector very easy. The color scheme is also nice. As far as functionality, installation was really smooth, I had Windows 8.1 installed on a RAID 0 config and the RAID did not have to be rebuilt! Simply enabling RAID in the EFI interface did the trick. Overclocking is as good as it was on my Gigabyte 890FXA-UD5 running a baseclock of 250 for 3.5Ghz CPU clock speed was no problem (tried at 265 and was also succesful however my CPU was never able to do 3.7Ghz stable, 3.64 max). The UEFI interface is pleasant to behold and easy enough to navigate and loaded with options for overclocking (minus a few important one, but more on that in the cons).Cons:My biggest concern with this motherboard, is the UEFI BIOS. It certainly takes some getting used to, but there are some rather important features missing.1) I am missing CPU multi, if I clear CMOS, the option appears but does nothing and no settings will besaved, upon entering the UEFI BIOS again, the CPU multi adjust is completely missing.2) There is no CPU-NB voltage control (you can control the multi however).3) Voltage control, the board does not allow me to reduce the CPU voltage below default and the default voltage is a good bit above my CPU default voltage (default voltage is 1.375 but 1.428 is the lowest option, voltage will go lower for different power states however).4)when adjusting multi's you get the frequency number with default base clock. EX: you have base clock at 250 and CPU-NB at 2000, the CPU-NB speed is reported as 2000 in UEFI although the actual frequency is 2500Mhz.Conclusion:This is easily a wonderful board and have no doubt it could compete better with other motherboard manufacturers is not for the poor BIOS found on most ECS boards. ECS does not update the BIOS like other major manufacturers (my gigabyte board received 6 and ever option, overclocking or not, worked flawlessly). As it is I am extremely happy with my purchase. I purchased the board onsale for $79.99, amazon had a $12 coupon, and I applied for the amazon visa card and received an additional $30 off, so my after tax investment was $42.07. if not for the low price of purchase the board is not really worth the $120 normal price considering the BIOS issues and you could get a better supported board for just a little more, but if you catch it on sale, absolutely a good deal. So please ECS step up with BIOS functionality .", "overall": 4.0}

{"reviewText": "... despite how repulsive the slavering, rustic fanaticsof the Reaction had become in their violent rejection ofreason. At the end, the sermons of the Holy Machine wereto me - moving and relevant in a way that modern preachersrarely are.The Holy Machine seems to echo a popular skeptic meme of the fundamentalist apocalypse: 'what if religious nut-cases conquered everything', but it goes deeper than that - it explores the real root of belief, religion, and faith with sharp insights that stuck with me long after turning the final page.The robots are used to illustrate the seeming hypocrisy of Illyria, the lone island of reason in a world where the death penalty is seriously considered for the crime of teaching evolution. The athiest-hardliners cannot acknowledge that robots might become sapient, or that rejecting all possibility of the Divine is as narrow as the frothing-mouthed superstitious ravings of the backwards villagers that ascribe advanced technology to the work of demons.The robots too, are vehicles for the main character, and his traumatized mother to rediscover their own humanity even as the Holy Machine discovers its own destiny.In terms of the science that is so important to Illyria, the design and concept of the robots seems logical, and Beckett takes us into the mind of the machine to illustrate a mechanical, alien thought process. Some readers may be put off by the non-human mentality the sexbot Lucy develops, but again... she's not human, she's a gynoid built for sexual pleasure. Although, as a technical note, using real human tissue would be problematic, many veneral diseases could still be transmitted. But the story on the whole works very well. The robots have a logical design, and the story does not depend on giving the sexbot dangerous superpowers that make no sense for her vocation - so common in robot fiction.Robots and humans alike mesh into a work of philosophical potency through a journey of internal discovery. Some other good examples of robots used in this way would be the Fembot series, by D.B. story, or Apocalypse Doll: Reboot, by Xavier Cecil .", "overall": 5.0}
{"reviewText": "...Because the humanoid robot genre certainly has its share of bad ones. Most fembot/android storiesbecome sadly predictable = once it's revealed that the robot (even ones built for sexual pleasure)has the strength of a dozen silverback gorillas on steroids, you know that's going to trigger a chain of contrived events leading to human carnage and a robot uprising. Which argues against making humanoid robots like that in the first place. But alas! Not here! Not Nymph!Suzanne and her ilk are clearly revealed as robots, but without human-threatening superpowers used as devices to force the drama. Of course, some stories go the other way - they say somebody is a robot, but they never really demonstrate any differences from a human being, you just take it on faith. Not here: Suzanne is Solar-Powered, could put a circus contortionist to shame, and if you prick her....well, it's complicated. There is a logic to how the Nymphs are built and how the story flows. And a good dose of real science and anatomy (so many facial muscles!)The plot is driven by human desire, grief, lust and pride - not outrageous super powers; and yet at the end - there is still some threat, some tension and risk, and an evolving character arc that reveals new depths to humans and robots alike. Nymph: The Singularity is a rare gem of excitement, wish-fulfillment, and stimulation (both intellectual and otherwise) Other good eggs in a similar vein would be 'The Holy Machine' by Chris Beckett, and Apocalypse Doll: Reboot, by Xavier Cecil .", "overall": 5.0}

I also went from an Nvidia 9500 GT to an Nvidia 650 GTx Ti boost and now the game runs great on full settings. Also, Radeon cards aren't great to use, to be honest. NVidia is more compatible for games now a days. Trying to use the min. requirements for this game will have you tearing your hair out because of the constant FPS (Frames Per Second) loss. And with newer games coming out anymore, it's better to go big with a PC than to sit there with a crappy dual core board that can't do much at all with today's games.This game is great and fun, at least for me, I love Spider-Man games because of the free world roaming, looking for hidden stuff to unlock costumes, and, yeah the battles can be a bit boring after a while because it does repeat, but the game is great fun. I gave it 5 stars because the game does have a great story line and great play-ability.

Hard outer shell fits greatand sports a decent pull-out stand to watch video. Finally, the case cover offers excellent protection as well as a sturdy belt clip.

Since this book is titled by Gann as the Master Commodities Course, if you are not already familiar with the basics of his technique, you might read through it at first and wonder, what the hell is he talking about? But if you are familiar with the basics of his technique then this book should shed more light on those techniques and if you follow the rules suggested by Gann, a lot of the guess work normally associated with trading will disappear .", "overall": 5.0}

{"reviewText": "FIrst, Amazons shipping seems to always arrive before the projected date.  I like that.  Now, the Curt 13322 Receiver is a fantastic item and the price was too good to pass up.  My review is going to hopefully outline a couple of things I simply didn't know prior to mounting it on my truck.  Most socket sets don't include a 22mm socket unless you're a real mechanic.  I'm not.  Save yourself a LOT of misery and when you order this item at Amazon, go ahead and run to the hardware store and get a 22mm socket.  While you're there, if you don't have at least a 8 inch extension for your socket wrench, buy one of them too.  If it wasn't for running to the store to buy the socket, I would have had this receiver installed in about 15 minutes.  Add in my driving time, and it quickly becomes 45 minutes!  My fault completely.  Why the extension for the socket wrench?  If you don't mind dropping your spare tire, you won't need it.  I didn't feel like dropping mine, and by adding in a bit of length between the socket and the wrench, you will alleviate the need to drop your spare.  At least on my '12 model Chevy, I did not need to trim any fascia as the paperwork suggested may be needed.  All in all, I HIGHLY recommend this receiver.  Installation was a breeze and not time consuming at all.  I'll say pretty much anyone could get under there and do it as long as they have the right tools.  I mean ANYONE.  Plus, as others have said...  this aftermarket receiver actually looks far better than the stock Chevy one. Personal opinion of course .", "overall": 5.0}

{"reviewText": "I bought two of these for my eleven year old boys this christmas. We have other airhogs so we have some basic flying skills and this toy at first seemed very hard to fly and wasn't much fun. We kept trying though and finally figured out the whole launch button on the remotes top left corner and if pressed fast it hops and if pressed and held for a second it goes into a fly mode. If held in it just hops and crashes. So dont start with car on the ground,pick it up and hold it lose in your right hand while holding the controller in the left hand. Now give it just a little throttle not even half way and then hold the launch button for a second or untill the rpm increase and the car takes flight then release the launch button and now you are flying at eye level nice hovering. after doing this a few times you will learn the feel and be able to drive to fly, to land to fly. This is very fun and has much more control then the small havoc heli they sell.We are now able to make this thing drive on the ground then take flight and controle the missle launch and are now getting very acurate with them.The right trigger on the remote will fire the missles when held down.Great toy and very easy to fly once you understand the launch button and how it works. Hours of fun for two eleven year old boys and their thiry seven year old dad .", "overall": 5.0}

{"reviewText": "I have had this saddle five days now. I am already in love with it. It is the second best thing that I have purchased for triathlon. Second only to my TT bike that it is on. After putting the saddle on, I went for an hour ride doing laps around my neighborhood stopping at my house every 10-15 minutes to adjust the saddle until I had it in the correct position for my riding style. Once I got it set up, it blew my mind. I wish I had bought it as soon as I purchased my bike. It was a little different the first ride because all of the pressure is now on your sitbones. Since then, nothing but bliss while riding. Not one thought during the whole of my rides goes to my saddle. Before, with my regular saddle, after about 30 minutes in the TT position it would be uncomfortable, After an hour or so go numb and again around 2 hours become uncomfortable. All those issues have disappeared with the ISM Adamo Time Trial Saddle. I can stay in the TT position all day. Plus, my power output has gone up as well and I am spinning easier.
