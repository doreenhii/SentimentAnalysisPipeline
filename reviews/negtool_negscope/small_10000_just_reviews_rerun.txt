It is and does exactly what the description said it would be and would do. Couldn't be happier with it .
I was sketchy at first about these but once you wear them for a couple hours they break in they fit good on my board an have little wear from skating in them. They are a little heavy but won't get eaten up as bad by your grip tape like poser dc shoes .
Solid, stable mount. Holds iPhone with phone protector well. I have not however used the dash mount part of this product (only windshield .
I bought this pepper because I wanted a lot of cayenne powder I mean a lot. I drink shots of this powder daily and I do like it but I'm not sure if it's just me but it does not seem to strong I sweat for a minute but I feel like it could be stronger I even touched my eyes to see if it would hurt still not feeling much pain. Im one in 7 billion so do forget my review since I'm more hardcore .
Beautiful photos/film with wonderful music.  Giriodi lets you know where you are with on screen notes.  It helps to keep your heart in Colorado when you can't be there .
My idea of Colorado is &#34;Mountains&#34;.  Colorado Landscapes seemed to focus on the flatlands and foothills.  It gave you no idea where you were  - it could have used a narrator or notes on-screen .
No matter what we did the bills just kept jamming in the machine. The bill counts were not consistent. We returned the product because it did not work correctly .
i do not suggest buying this product i thought it seemed nice and everything but it did not work when i removed it from the packaging. for this reason i do not trust the shipping methods that the seller uses .
It is not a sticker, it is a Chritsmas story  by itself, full of details, and cover a big  space .
The condition of the book was exactly as described. There were minimal if any damages, and certainly nothing that would hinder the use of the book .
Only negative. Thing I can say is when my fish swim near the sides of the tank at the top they aren't illuminated by the light from the center. The blue night light is beautiful. The led light gives a healthy glow during the day, and overall the Hood looks and works great .
This book caught my eye, and when I read the sample, I was hooked. The final hook was one other reviewer explaining the unemotional aspect of the book's dramatic swings, because of the method of writing employed. (I have often been accused of being unemotional, or anti-sentimental... which is not true. People show these depths of feeling in many different ways--not all of us are weepers, people...) And The Call delivered. The emotion is there, and it's pretty raw at times, but it's emoted in unexpected ways. The characters cracked me up, felt very real, and the story was believable and at times serious, then light, then laugh-out-loud funny. I really enjoyed the writing style, and although it did take a few pages of adjustment, I was very glad I stuck with it. In the same way that Cormac MacCarthy's writing is at first difficult to take in, this was a little bit tough to &#34;get&#34; until I'd gotten through several pages. I have already recommended this to several people. Made me want to try writing again .
I was already of this author's opinion, and everything he said just cemented my position. He presents his history, how he came to be in the position he's in, how his life experiences (especially outside of America) have molded his expectations and understanding of value and wealth, and he makes a great case with real examples of how simplification is the best way. You'll be changed permanently by how many of your problems are &#34;first-world&#34; type, nothing more. Well worth the read--our culture could benefit greatly by more exposure to, and influence by, this book .
most boys would eat this up. it has all the requisite characteristics of a movie for young boys. it was funny, it had some good fights, some out-smarting some bad guys, and explosions to boot. I didn't watch the whole thing with him, but picked up on some good lessons about being yourself and being true to friends. not a morality lesson, but hey--better than lots of garbage out there. he really enjoyed it and went back to see some parts again/show me. he would have watched it again immediately if I hadn't kiboshed the idea...-mom .
Love this grill and the fact that the plates are removable to put in the dishwasher.  Bun warmer doesn't grill the buns but just warms them up but I didn't buy the unit for that anyways.  It's also twice as big as my last George Foreman grill so I am a happy grilled .
I buy these for my om every year at Christmas and she loves them.  She wouldn't own any other brand.  I was skeptical when she first asked for them but they are high quality and durable.  She wears them every day.  Also, Amazon prices are better than anywhere on the web - haven't found them cheaper .
I don't ever read but this book changed me I love love this book I hated when I got to the last book I didn't want it to be over .
This book wasn't as good as 50 Shades oh Grey but it was a very good book I would tell someone to get this book .
The author has been there and done that when it comes to what he suggests. He was an Air Force SERE ( Survival Evasion Resistance Escape ) instructor for 30 years. His approach to the subject of survival is practical in that he does NOT approach the topic with primitive tool making or cutting trees down to make a shelter. His approach is quick, practical and effective. I highly recommend this book .
I have purchased this product several times and have gotten the same poor results, the adhesive sucks.  I have used it to hang many small objects, such as a tv remote, a small alarm clock or even to hide wires unde a cabinet.  The adhesive just does not stick well to anything, except itself.  I have no complaints about the hook and loop side, but it is certainly not anything that should be called &#34; industrial strength&#34; if the adhesive can't even hold up a tv remote,  3M please fix this problem, I know you have better permanent adhesive that can withstand a warm surface, but this product adhesive is a big FAIL .
Because I have not gotten the book yet, I may change my mind when I get it. I will let you know .
This was a great book, easy read, laugh out loud funny. Can't wait to read Sugar Ticket. Highly recommend this book. Looking forward to reading all the other books by Susan Ricci .
This Hammermill 106125 - Color Copy Paper, 100 Brightness, 28lb, 12 x 18, Photo...paper works great. does not curl like other brands .
the hooks were not chipped shipping was really fast nothing was broken all hooks were in package as described with all the sizes A+++++ thank you .
My son loves these gloves! They're the only ones he hasn't lost this winter! Will be ordering them again next winter .
Product is not long enough to secure to headrests in my 2013 dodge ram. Product seems like it is meant for small vehicles .
I just received a set of Japanese Hiragana and Katakana flash cards by Glen McCabe as recently revised by Professor Emiko Konomi.  I am really impressed, both by the low price and by the overall quality and value of the set.  The real usefulness of a set like this is in the way it can facilitate the speed and accuracy of character recognition.  I'm looking forward to using it this way.  The cards are plastic coated, so they won't get "funky" like the ones I made for myself some time ago.  Each card has a series of words written in kana, which aids in the reading of whole words.  One of the most important features involves a high quality CD that comes with the cards.  Using the CD in conjunction with the cards allows the learner to completely avoid using roomaji, and go directly from the Japanese character to the correct Japanese pronunciation.  The 200 cards include the so-called "twisted sounds" as well as the "voiced" sounds.  There are also wall charts of the characters, which, sad to say, I still find necessary on occasion.  For the beginner, such charts would be of great value.  I am currently teaching "Scientific Communication in English" at the Tokorozawa Campus of Waseda University.  I am a colleague of Konomi-sensei at Portland State University and have also been a student in a Japanese class in which she was the instructor.  She is truly a master teacher, and has used her considerable skills to produce a valuable and useful aid in the flash card set .
The case feels a bit cheap but overall it's a nice case. A but hard to use when a call comes in but if you usually use headsets it won't be a problem .
A great little bit. I was having trouble finding a bit in this size and was glad to have found it. Not disappointed in the performance. Holds up well to heven harder woods .
I'm sorry but this movie was horrible. i can't believe i actually sat through the whole thing. The acting was bad, the plot sucked, and nobody actually knew how to play the guitar. I'll give it this, some of the humor was good, but that was the only good point. The music may be considered good by some but to me the songs grated on my nerves and all the background music was cheap and overused. This might be acceptable for kids, but it certainly is not for me. Oh, and cinderella is saddened by this lack of respect to her name .
I love it! But there's some flaws like nothing really! Its so fun now i can reach my friends over summer! How cool! You should definitely download this app! Enjoy .
will not fit kindle fire hd 7&#34;had to order different brand hope it fitsor maybe my kindle is one of a kind .
The mp3 comes in Chinese!!! I DON'T KNOW THAT LANGUAGE, I AM ORDERING FOM USA. I DON'T UNDERSTAND ANYTHING AND I AM NOT ABLE TO CHANGE IT .
I have been using this product for about three weeks, and couldn't be happier! I have been using it for about 4 weeks now, and the results have been amazing, I have lost inches around my waist and am getting closer to the flat tummy I have always wanted. I am a full time college student, but I make sure I make the time to get to the gym Monday through Friday! When I received my product there was a paper inside offering me a free bottle, and who doesn't love free stuff? I received a call from Maggie who asked me how the product was working, and encouraged me to call if I ever had any questions, as she said "we are here to help you reach your goal". A company that cares about the customers, and gives a free product gets my vote 100%!! With all that being said give naturewise a try.Thank you Naturewise, and Maggie for your encouraging words .
Very dry, discolored, not one sprouted... Out of 10 seeds. I am an avid seeder and planter and vegetable gardener .
The Foscam FI8919W is a great camera. I am a dealer for Foscam and I sell a lot of the FI9810W. Fantastic camera for the money. I thought I would try this camera and bought 3 for my company to test. So great... We hooked it up in 5 minutes, setup is like any other Foscam Camera, the IR works great, not sure why people are putting this camera down... We have been "working" one of the cameras all the time to try to make it fail and it still works great. Im buying more and going to promote it more as well .
Not stable. Had to return .
connot be beaten for the price! works likea charm and i would absolutely recommend this product to anyone looking for at the very least an entry level antenna .
We ordered this Ted doll for our son that is in college. It was the Christmas hit in our household. After much research trying to make sure we ordered the right doll, we certainly received the correct one. This doll is the &#34;EXPLICIT&#34; version. We learned we needed to order the one with the &#34;RED Letter R&#34; tag to get what we wanted (which we did)! He also sings the &#34;Thunder Song&#34;! To our surprise, he is huge...a true 24&#34;!! He also looked identical to the movie bear! We received this bear within 3 days, which was through our Amazon Prime account. I would highly recommend this one to anyone looking for these options. Will not be disappointed .
The costume was Great Quality it had a lot of room to wear clothes underneath to stay warm.  You could easily run and play and the costume did not tear.  The shipment was very fast, received it in 3 days with standard shipping .
Before ordering this online, I read some reviews saying it wasn't as strong as what they got in the store.  I wonder if they are comparing cologne they originally had to this product which is eau de toilette, a much lighter fragrance, which I prefer.  For me, this was a great deal .
Not wanting to run wires out to the patio I thought I would give these a try.  After getting them delivered and seeing how small and lightweight they are, I was skeptical.  After hooking them up, I was surprised by how good the sound quality was.  They are very easy to install.  I used a 3.5mm Stereo Female to RCA Male Y-Cable to attach the transmitter to an audio out plug on my AV Reciever.  This way I can play CDs or listen to the music channels from Cable TV.  I have them plugged into wall sockets, instead of using batteries, since other reviews said the sound quality isn't as good with the batteries (although I never did try batteries).  I bought a second pair of speakers (comes with a free transmitter) to use on another section of the patio, still using just the one transmitter.  Very easy to set up .
Fairly fast delivery. Very good price. Will try to buy from again in future.Most places were much higher. Just started using one of the batteriesso I can't comment on much else yet .
I am a newbie at buying\using usb sticks. I found out I could store full length movies on them & play them back on my tv with a fairly low cost media player. I think it's pretty neat to be able to store 5 or 6 movies on a 16 gig little stick & watch them on tv without messing with storing DVD's. I don't know much about these sticks or how long they should last etc., but hey, no moving parts! I bought this item at a very reasonable price & shipping was pretty good. Would buy again. Probably soon .
I'm a newbie with USB sticks. Got to thinking it would be neat if I could convert an entire DVD movie to a SINGLE Mpeg file. Found a program that does that. Ok, NOW I have an entire movie on a little stick and in the process all the dvd files were compressed a lot with no noticable loss in video or audio quality! Trouble was NOW I'd like to view this on my tv. Did some looking and found this thing.My only complaints are that the usb and flash card ports are upside down and it should have come with an HDMI cord. But luckily I had one on hand so all went easy and fast. So far I have two movies on one 16 gig stick with room for 4 to 6 more (depending on movie length). So far, quite happy .
I don't know if there was a problem with the download or what the deal is, but it just isn't a full game. Every hunting unlimited i've had was a full map, run or drive around, and hunt everything. This game seems very limited, with several glitches... i hate to say it, but i'm really not impressed with it .
Some scratches on the screen and quality isn't as great as the original but for half the price HP was going to charge, I'm satisfied .
I was surprised when I received this pipe in the mail because it far exceeded its images and description!  The pipe smokes great and has an appreciable feel while holding it.  All around good pipe, no complaints .
By sharing this information, I am breaking the first and second rules of Fight Club. I heard somewhere that rules are made to be broken so here goes. It is an amazing book and has instantly become one of my favorites.  One of the most original stories I have ever read. I love how it allows you to dive into the mind of an split personality type and helps you realize that you are not your kindle, your car, or your XBOX. They did an excellent job adapting it into a motion picture so check out the movie if you haven't had the chance. I am Jack's satisfied mind .
You sent the wrong size!  I have a Samsung Galaxy S 111 mini!  Do you have it that size?  It is so pretty, but it doesn't fit my phone, ITS TOO BIG!!  Can you send me another, and I'll send this back to you .
I am so upset!  None of the cases I ordered came in the right size!!  I have a Samsung  Galaxy S 111 mini!  I wanted the cases for my new phone, and I have none!  Can you send me the correct size?  I will send the others back to you, at your cost. of course .
I bought this for my 5 year old nephew and he was overjoyed!!I used it first to test it out! it was very good. Can't beat the bargain .
I bought this to carry my cakes and it is very practical it works. Walmart has it as well for about the same price I later found out. It does its duty however I think it should be a little more secure for the little minicakes. If you don't hold it upright they all turn over .
Not happy... very sloppy made others were better. I have received better made fans for less. They made these very sloppy some were broken or stuck with glue .
ahhh I can't wait to get this one...it should be on its way. Me without you!!! Love this song. Can't wait to jam with it in the car .
Some don't close well. But you get what you pay for. They can do better than this material I think .
Hi Everyone,Well, I ordered this for my bible study group. There are quite a few bible study groups I will be visiting week after week and we need something to hold the bible as we teach but practical without the bulk. Can't wait to see what this one really looks like and works.I like it cause it will go with me where ever I go! Stay tuned...So I recieved this lectern and I was very pleased with the quality and how easy it is to set up. What made me so much more glad is that it can have a display banner attach to it and that thrilled me. I recommend this to any body who need a compact place to set their papers for a bible study or presentation .
What a delightful read! Carol has hit the nail with the hammer, dead bang on! I thoroughly enjoyed this wonderful book, well written and very insightful, not to mention the wit and humor that accompany the sound advice. There is much to be said for many of the suggestions that she has offered, and I truly believe both men and women should take the time to read this book for sure. Very helpful and informative when it comes to understanding the opposite sex .
i bought this product and it didn't work for me, it tastes really nasty and i felt no different after taking it. this stuff doesnt work .
I know they're cheap, but don't let amazon get away with false advertising. Compare the ones you receive with the set in the picture. NOT THE SAME. I don't know who could possibly give these false advertised chisels a good review. Anyone who knows anything about woodworking would know that these are Chinese garbage not worthy of a doorstop. Granted these are not premium chisels, but the ones pictured are good mid-level chisels. I don't know if anyone else is, but I am SO SICK of the false advertising on this website. The chisels shown in the picture are the Irwins that were still made in Sheffield England (originally Marples which was great quality), it even says it on the chisel in the picture. Irwin has outsourced their work to China unfortunately, but somehow Amazon is still allowed to show a picture of quality English made chisels and then send you the garbage made in China that have different handles, blade metal, and overall quality. THIS IS INSANE. Needless to say I sent the chisels back for a refund. Amazon gets an F for its report card today .
Nothing special here. It feels good in my hand, does the job it is intended for,  holds an edge well, and doesn't flex when you score wood .
So I recieved the batman trilogy on blu-ray and I went to play the batman begins disc and it would not play. I tried it in a blu-ray player and my ps3 with firmware updates and got nothing. Not only does it not play but it shuts off and freezes the entire blu ray player, and on the ps3 you get to the home screen and there is no play button. Soooo disappointing !!!! even though I'm in the minority with this opinion I like batman begins as much as dark knight rises. So I say to what ever company is pumping these out without quality control, PLEASE STOP!!! it is not just me this has happened to 2 other people I know .
Really good show can't wait for this Sundays episode .
I Liked it but it didt protect my screen from cracking so it was very disappointing.  I wouldn't recommend it .
Very poor quality. It comes in two parts and it doesn't stay together . This case looks nice online but when it came to me it was very flimsy .
The ADAPTER snapped as soon as I put my phone to charge!!!! The HEADPHONE cable is extremely LONG...u get 0000 STARS!!!! DONT BUY THIS SHIT PEOPLE .
I purchased the Bushnell GPS so we could find our way back to our starting point when we were walking while on vacation. It worked when I tested it in our home town, but was not able to find the satellite when I really needed it when we were vacationing in Aruba and later in St Petersburg Fl.Since it won't work in the situations where I need it the most, it is totally worthless to me. I am extremely disappointed and would strongly recommend against buying this product.Clifford JoensTryon, NC .
The book wasn't what I was expecting. I was hoping to have some recipes I haven't heard of or tried. Most of the recipes were either something I seen before or things my picky eater wouldn't eat .
bought this as a gift and recived it really quick but was defected the quality of pic looked like an x ray picture sent it back had to pay $9.50 extra out of pocket not happy..Recived the 2nd one in 2-3days very pleased my brother loves it great product .
Just got mine in the mail and it looks just like it is advertised. I am not the biggest fan of the keyboard slip just because i do not like the way it feels when i type makes me feel like i have to press extra hard, other than that i love it, and it shipped quickly .
When I got the engine, I did probably assembled it incorrectly, because it worked for 3 days only. I contacted Dorita at Jensen, and she told me to ship it to the for repairs. They repair my engine, sent it back to me UPS second day, and they did not charged me for the repair. Excellent and friendly customer service .
The unit turns on, but the weight plate doesn't work at all. It says 0.00 no matter what you put on it, in any mode .
Absolutely love it. Goes on very easily and not oily at all..would highly recommend this product to all my friends .
I am addicted to this show. If not for amazon I would have to wait until the season was over befor watching it .
They don't glow. I was 100% disapointed. I thought that they were going to be cool and glow. I guess I thought wrong .
not very sturdy and doesn't work very well when you have heavy stuff like cans on it. would NOT recommend .
this is a awesome! i don't have a fenced yard so these are perfect to keep them close by, just putting them on and hitting the vibrate to let them know they are wearing it is enough to make them behave .
when i first got it it kinda worked but isn't compatible with my ipad only my iphone. eventually it stopped working for my phone as well and it sucks because the long cord was so convenient .
Akiba Howard gave me the needed directions in my mid-life crisis that no self-help help book ever did. In his book I have learned and will practice the four steps that I know will guide me though my life. For anyone who doubts themselves in not believing in yourself or going through some tough times in your life, buy this book and make it your manual for a new beginning .
They worked very well with my canon mp190. Don't waste your money with original ones. No error, no mismatching, good business .
It's hard for me to believe this is Melinda R. Morgan's first book. The mixture of music, spirituality, romance, science, and the unknown are neatly connected for our reading pleasure. The pacing is nice. No action just for action's sake. The events unfold smoothly. It was satisfying in its own right, but left me wanting more .
I have read over 60 zombie novels including zombie fallout, a new world, the remaining, and surviving the dead. I would have to say i enjoyed this one every bit as much as those. In fact in some ways more because this was not another series, it actually had and ending. I spent a long time scrolling thru ebooks looking for and new zombie read and honestly didn't expect much out of this book but was happy enough with it to write the first review i have ever done. As far as the mistakes or grammar problems, i was enjoying the story to much to really notice any. GREAT story can't wait for the next one .
I am pleased that my case arrived fairly quick, but not too pleased with the look of it.The product preview depicts a more realistic looking stitch, with a dark aqua blue belly and eyes, maroon colored nose and feet, and eyes going into the edges of the case.Here's a picture of how mine looked.[IMG][...]As you can see, my colors are way off, and it looks more cartoon-y.Still pleased, but disappointed at the same time .
My glue was dry. My acrylic doesn't dry right, it's all gelly like it's old or something. I'm very upset, I was really excited for this. Welp, at least the gems and the oil are nice. -___- I'm mad I spent 16 dollars on this .
put miore cushion in bottom to soothe the feet make more space in th e front so they aren't so tight .
Interesting finale that ended up with characters dead who from the start is thought would've survived.  The finale is not a happy ending per say but a reasonable, practical one .
Very good In-depth view of the history of currency wars and the making of currency world war 3.  Should be a book taught in schools to not just business majors but all students since it will affect everyone's future .
I bought this battery for me to use at school. It works great and lasts a long time!! When I first got it, it took a couple of charges for it to work longer. After a while the battery started to last longer than the first days. It works great and I have had no problems with it. I would recommend anyone to purchase this battery, it works great and the price is worth it .
I bought this for my Samsung replenish Syracuse my old battery wasn't working any more.  This battery works great and lasts almost a whole day .
The labels says plantronics but performance sucks so bad as if it's built in china in 1980's. It's Dead on Arrival.We can't hear anything .
I discovered the first book as a recommendation from amazon list..tried the sample and I've devoured them all in 3 days!! I can not wait for the next one! I'm a huge Ilona Andrews, nalini Singh, Patricia Briggs fan and I actually put on hold my new nalini for your stories I was fascinated by the world u created and the character depth and detail is wonderful. Even secondary characters have great back stories and I hope to learn more about them all. Excellent writing and transitioning a few editing mistakes thru out the books but u hooked me into the story so deep I didn't care and believe me when I say I almost NEVER get over those things... I don't want to be bogged down by my own version of auto correct in my mind thru the stories to miss the fun of reading one so thank you for being as diligent as u were and I'll be back in sept for the new one .
This is a dumb app. all it is is a list of movies they think are a must have/see. Not the actual ability to watch the movie. Waste of money .
The images do leave a certain lasting impact, but the story is wonderfully whimsical. A delightful book for young ones. I  know my 21 month old sat quietly listening. What I don't like about it is my friend who isn't too familiar with reading with expression wouldn't fair so well reading it to a toddler. Not an easy flow .
The spirit of Selassie is with us through the riddim of ze Jamrock.  No retreat no surrender, RAH RAH LAH .
Them will never share so we have to bun dem all.  For the 9 who came from the 3, we Rock Solid .
I got this tent for my birthday and first set it up in the backyard one rainy spring weekend to test its water resistance.  It was a little damp and the wind collapsed it, but my yard is wide open and full of sand/gravel on that side.  I bought some more yellow stakes and we didn't blow away at all this weekend.  The tent also stayed dry under the cover of the trees which was great.  We love that we can fit our queen-size air mattress and 2 sleeping bags for the kids in the back room with plenty of room for storage and moving about.  The &#34;windows&#34; in the front screen room close up to keep the elements out which came in handy during the rain - especially with two young kids and a dog.  I put it together myself in less than twenty minutes and I'm only 5' 4&#34; tall.  I would definitely recommend it for families and people that camp for long amounts of time.  Our next camping trip will be for 7+ days and we can't wait .
Replaced my nonstick pans with this set.  So easy to use and clean.  Great for daily use.  Eggs won't stick.  Recently took the set camping and set the pans right in the fire.  Made eggs, sausage, burgers, hot dogs, and even boiled dinner (in the Dutch oven).  I will never use anything else .
I ordered this for my boyfriend as a Christmas gift last year and he absolutely loves it.  All of his friends are impressed by it and it's sturdy enough that our two year old daughter doesn't knock it over.  I would definitely recommend this product for gamers .
Excellent product deep corner pockets easy to wash/dry bought a different one for double the price that didn't fit as nicely.....great price excellent product .
First time I ordered a long sleeve anything that was longer than I expected.  I almost don't know how to act with a jacket sleeve that hits me right where it is supposed to.  I comes right to the base of my thumb when my arms are by my side.  Fantastic .
This review is not for the product, it's for Thermos! I ordered this lunch bag, it's THREE DAYS LATE, and it's still not here! I'm so angry. I want a refund .
The replacement lamp was just what I needed.  I was not sure what the problem was to begin with, but when I called different businesses to find out if they carried this lamp, one individual suggested I go to Amazon to order the lamp.  Amazon had the best price and the lamp was so easy to install.  My 10 year old grandson helped me with it .
I sent this e-card for my brother on Christmas and I was incredibly disappointed to find out that it didn't arrive on time and I had to re-send it. It went through right away when I had it re-sent, but there is really no excuse for an e-card to not arrive on time .
This item didn't meet my expectations at all. I really expected more! It's difficult to put in your ear, it infected my tragus piercing, it's super tiny, and it doesn't ever look like a heart ! Regret buying it and would've loved a refund .
When I first read this book it really got me reading more and more.I couldn't get enough of the series .
Read the first book of the series and the second is just as good as the first.Can't get enough of this book.A must read series .
Read this book and it is just as good as the rest.Can't get enough of this book.A must read series .
Read the first,second and third book and it is just as good.Can't get enough of this book.A must read series .
Reading this book made me wonder what else could happen.Can't wait for the next book of this story to come out .
Nice watch. Good size for the price. Always wanted a invicta watch and I wasn't disappointed with my purchase. Thanks .
It is really good! But it was hard to push out all the air bubbles. But that is not a big problem .
just as discribed, will work great have many tapes to reviewwill recommend to friends who may have tapes that they are not sure how to convert .
was a great accent to a winter wonderlannd themed party, arrived on time but not as sparkly and expected but will recommend .
Just for show, not very durable, or a of great protection.  Colorful and easy to coordinate, with clothes.  Enjoyed by everyone .
It arrived too late, not very useful, unless you use two at a timenot some think i would recommend .
they were very beautiful in package but lost sparle when applied to cakewere not easy to remove from packaging .
This is the only brace that does not slide around on my arm and allows me to comfortably play golf.  My tennis elbow is still healing and this  brace has helped me to be able to remain somewhat active while it does .
This is a very good description of a slow and steady capital growth strategy using options.  The book is clear and concise and does not require much additional information to implement aside from a good basic understanding of how options work.  I recommend it .
Have had the case for about a month now and it still works great. The fit is perfect. The slimness of the case is great, and the feel of it is very nice. I like it alot. My clips seem to be working great and hanging in there. So far no complaints or problems .
The feel and fit of the case was good, except that the microphone opening is in the wrong side and covers the mic.  with the case on, nobody can hear you, and also; to make it worse; if some of you wonder what is that small hole on the top of the F7 phone? Well, that is a secondary microphone with a noise reduction system, and of course, the case covers that mic also. Since it was cheap, I just opened the holes for the microphones with scissors, and for some other supernatural reason, everybody that I tried to talk to told me that they could not hear me, after removing the case, they could hear me ok .
Great product, worked perfectly. I didn't know how to use the "splicers" that it came with, but I was able to use a different type that I have. Took 20 minutes to install .
I hate this app! I know it's Free and all but I can't stand it! You can't move the stupid lady bug... don't get it waste of time .
I hate it! I was going through the tutorial and I had to do something else on my kindle fire for my mom and it wouldn't bring the home button up.. I had restart my kindle fire just to get outta the app!! If you are a person who wants to get out of an app without having to restart you device don't get it .
First off, it shipped very quickly. The box was a little dented, but the bottle itself was perfect so I didn't really care. I quickly went to put it on. My nails look like diamonds now. It goes on perfectly, but everyone needs to remember/ realize that you dab glitter nail polish on for a first coat, then paint on a second coat. It makes for very uniform nails. I'm really satisfied with this purchase, and I'm actually relieved so see the comments that it chips off easily because I'm horrified at how difficult it is to remove glitter nail polish. Anyways, I would recommend this polish to anyone. It's fantastic .
i tested this out and like most won't leave home without it. If you are a serious outdoorsman you need to carry this item at all times .
no way to attach a canister of fuel from u.s.a. coleman portable tanks. Base size is different from u.s. size attachement .
good purchase, this knife used with lansky system is razor sharp. would reccommend for most outdoors uses. have not put it through the paces yet .
Lampos deals with very difficult teaching situations in a very practical manner. Using true-life stories from her own experience, she weaves easily applicable educational principles throughout the book --- and she does it painlessly. "Teaching Diamonds in the Tough" is devotional in format, but don't let the casual structure fool you. This book has very powerful, sometimes heart-wrenching, stories of troubled children, their struggles and successes. And it presents some of the most workable ideas for teaching students like this that I have ever seen. Our culture is moving so fast in this direction that we are in danger of losing an entire generation if we don't learn how to teach, guide and mentor troubled students with love and acceptance. This book is a great tool for the job.David E. FessendenAuthor ofTeaching with All Your Heart: Bringing Curriculum & Class to Life .
I haven't, of course, read the whole book -- I mean, after all, it is a devotional with 52 entries, so I assume the author expects you to read one a week for a year. But I have read several, all in one sitting -- I couldn't stop myself -- and I intend to dip back into this regularly (maybe weekly, maybe more often). It's a very accessible devotional, and not something you have to work at to read.That doesn't mean I consider it fluffy or frothy -- far from it. Rose Chandler Johnson covers a wide range of topics and bases each devotional entry on a Scripture passage. The passages she chooses are from all over the Old and New Testaments; they are mostly well-known verses, but she manages to bring a fresh perspective to them. She is able to be profound without becoming pedantic or obtuse -- and that is a hard balance to maintain.This would be a great devotional for a new Christian, but even the more seasoned believer will get a lot out of it, despite the fact that it is intentionally light reading. Have you ever read a devotional early in the morning, and just couldn't follow it because the text was too plodding? You won't have that problem with this devotional, but you will still be challenged by it .
Eddie Jones begins his book with a disclaimer that it is a collection of supporting material from the classes he teaches, and is not a "full-blown writing book." Be that as it may, this short read contains more direct practical advice than many of the "full-blown" books I've read on fiction writing. focusing on four prevailing elements of good fiction --- plot, dialogue, characters and scenes --- Jones covers the essence of these, identifying where an author can go wrong and providing good examples of the right way to do it. Do I wish at times that he had gone into a point more fully? Of course, but then I would have had to invest far more time in reading the book. I like how pithy and succinct this book is --- similar to some of the advice he gave me when I wrote (and revised) my first novelThe Case of the Exploding Speakeasy. I'm sure I'll be referring to A Novel Idea again and again as I write my next novel .
The story plot and special effects along with a really hip cast makes this a series I don't want to miss .
My daughter was nothing but smiles when she opened this gift!Thanks So Much! She uses this purse every single day now .
the fishes where not painted as detailed as portrayed,single bland colors,also two fishes where missing side fins and a few have nicked paint from shipping..i feel decieved .
I like this game.itseasy to get stuck on a level.but its still interesting to play.I'm stuck on level 25.I don't think you should have to spend money to get a hint so you can get to the next level.but oh well .
This app is really fun for long car rides and boring days. Some of the emojis don't make much sense but all in all its a really fun game .
Those boots look good, but when we have a lot of snow they  always get wet inside and it's just snow,  not  water or something, therefore I don't know why they called waterproof! I'm really frustrated .
I liked this book a lot because it was very exciting and kept me on the edge of my seat just having to know what was going to happen next. Also, it was nice to finally find out why the "crazy vampire" was after Kismet. The only thing I didn't like about it was the fact that Devereux was not in this book as much as he was the others, but it was still great even so! I absolutely can't wait for the next on to come out .
I thought this book was wonderful!! Very well thought out, exciting, romantic, and full of fun! I was glad to see a lot more of Devereux in this book as he is my favorite character!! I just couldn't put it down once I started reading it! I read it in under a day .
I really liked this book! It wasn't quite as exciting as the "Vampire Shrienk" series, but still a fun book none the less. I really liked the female character, she seemed very strong and independent. The sex scenes in this book were really "hot" as well .
This short story was cute and funny! It doesn't have anything to do with Devereux so if you are expecting that then you will be disappointed. If you really love this series like I do then you should definately read this shorty story as well. Just don't try to read this without reading the other books that came before it or you will definatley not get it. I recommend reading them all for sure .
It's not authentic carger. Should not this purchase. I got fake charger.BAD BUY, I would like to return. It's not authentic carger .
The big barker bed is amazing! You can tell as you open the packaging that the seller really cares about the product. Right out of the box, you can see the quality that goes into the product. I own a 105lb pitbull and he didn't even sag into the mattress!! I bought the large and it was perfect for him. Do not be fooled by cheap knockoffs, this is the Rolls Royce of dog beds!! My dog sleeps on a better bed than me now .
So theres already 12,009 reviews here! Everything i could say has been said - the books awsome! All these one star reviews - WHAT? I loved it, the whole series, beginning to end! It wasn't mind numbing to read, theres plenty to keep you entertained cover to cover. I couldnt put it down. The hunger games trilogy opened up a can of worms for me in this particular genre, lots of delightful worms .
I just finished Sweet Thing and have the biggest smile on my face:) *points finger... Renee Carlino is amazing! She had me with the prologue, I thought " wow, this is different" after you read so many books they sort of start to become obvious and there are so many with the same story line. I loved will, he was a breath of fresh air. My husband walked in on me reading and laughed and said " a good one, huh?"  If you haven't read this, you really should .
Absolutely loved this book..... I don't think Karina Halle could write a bad book.An emotional journey of love, passion, tattooed girls and hot spaniards .
Great case would recommend it to my friends...The item can take a lil abuse, wouldn't recommend throwing or smashing it .
Its been running great for about a month now. I haven't noticed any noise issues at all. Good water movement for a small tank .
Cute Case!  I was concerned that the beads would start falling off right away - not so.  Have had the case for a few months and everything is still intact. Note - takes a few weeks to ship .
My husband got my wedding ring and I guess he forgot to ask me my ring size and bought it without knowing and its platinum and diamond so I don't want to just give it to some one to size so I ordered the sizing ring gard and couldn't believe how easy it was to put on so now I can were my ring with out worrying about loosening it thank ya so much!  Vera .
My husband is a good ol country boy and is not big on fancy things so he lost his wedding ring from when we got married and told him to pick  that he likes on Amazon and liked this one because it has wood on it so I ordered it and he loves it and it is just perfect for him so now hopefully he won't loose it! Vera .
It is a good game but unless you buy it, you don't get to play much of it. Would have liked to see more before planning on buying .
I love this series of books. It keeps my attention all the way through the books and makes me want to read more. I can't wait for the next books .
I didn't know if I would like the game or not.tried it and I have to say I'm pretty impressed with the app. S1 Alfheim: 17nua3g5 .
The item was a lot different than the picture on amazon. The picture showed blues and greens and a little purple. The bag that I got had lots of red patterns and there was no leaf patterns on it that was in the picture either. The price is to high especially since the picture is not even accurate .
This product was very well made and will last forever but it just doesn't work as a belt clip.Damages dress belts with minimum useNot secure on wide beltsScreen faces out so it is exposed to possible damage and nosy peopleI am very impressed with all the other products from this company but they need to put more through into a belt clip design .
This book is amazing. The details are awesome. I love the book and all the great pop ups. I didn't expect this book to be so great. I was afraid it wasn't going to be all that, but it was. I love this book .
It is agood car holder recomend u to buy it but moves alot while driving but generaly good stuff and the shipping was great i got it after 2 weeks not a month thank u .
You will definitely see life through different eyes after reading this book! Brene Brown is brilliant and brings so much to life that we take advantage of. This is not a fad or the next best thing, this is reality, a way of life. You will feel empowered and transformed, you will appreciate and recognize your own vulnerability and courageous acts of others. I truly brings you back down to a good, comfortable place where you can enjoy yourself and others without be critical and embrace life as it is.Great for anybody! Highly recommended! Love her style and how she gets her message out .
I started using this product about 8 months ago and have been very pleased. I am very sensitive to other shampoos including very high end products. After using CLEAR I shortly noticed a significant improvement in the health of my scalp and hair. My hair is naturally wavy and requires additional products to keep the frizz down. With CLEAR Frizz control I don't need to use additional products and it takes less time to get ready in the morning.I have referred this product to many people and now my sister and her family and brother and his family are using this. They are all very satisfied.Highly recommended. Your hair will look amazing in less than a week .
It is good for me to recharge the battery in my cell phone Maybe it works in other cell phone but not mine .
Got to me before Christmas  I bought one from one of the local stores in my area.  but for the price it is not bad .
Once key board is set it should stay there, Hands free speaker is  not Loud enough but still a great phone .
Fits Well, will not slip out off my hand.I was surprised tot get it so early.I have decided to keep my LG 800 and I am looking for the same cover for my older phone .
Works good.  I was able to hear conversation and it lessened the noise from semi auto hand gun noise.  I have not used it with rifle yet .
I just needed one part that clamps on my uniform for work.  All other parts haven't been used yet.  I will probably use the dash mount eventually .
I bought three of these for all of our vehicles.  One does not like staying mounted.  Other two work great.  Just a little quality control issues .
I have another one that has a metal or die cast housing.  This one appears to be made only from plastic.  I do not care for it .
I got these a couple weeks ago.  They can be scratched easily.  They also do not repell dirt and dusti as well as I read. Ok but a little priced to high for what you get .
Great quality case with excellent quality foam.  Outer shell, hinges and latches are very durable and not 'cheap' feeling. My Blade 350 QX fits unbelievably well.  Quite pleased .
thought there would be more of a color assortment. to many of the same dull colors. men they were bought for were not impressed .
Nancy Grisham encourages the reader to TRUST GOD in ALL of LIFE.  She reminds the reader of who God is and His faithfulness while encouraging us to trust Him with everything.  This is a book that needs to be revisited.  (You can't just read it once.)  It is filled with scripture.  It is practical and personal.  It is inspiring and encouraging.  I recommend this book for anyone who wants to be encouraged to trust the Lord with reckless abandon .
The copy I purchased was used but in decent shape.  There are no highlights or underlines in the text.  The seller shipped the book immediately and I was pleasantly surprised to receive my book so quickly.  As for the text itself, I would recommend this textbook to anyone interested in studying floral design.  It is a good &#34;go to&#34; reference for designers so a wise investment .
Could not put it down. Easy read. Past around to other family members and they loved it too. Hooray for those who rescue dogs .
Had a similar one with different style material and it snagged terribly. This one fits and feels wonderful and have no issue with snagging .
Well made and just the right weight. Not to heavy not to light. Have seen similar design but this one had the best price. Very pleased .
So happy I ordered these! Especially this specific brand. Don't waste your money on the others at your local home improvement stores. We recently planted 4 new trees. No more dragging the hose through the yard everyday to keep them watered .
Lindsey Stirling's album is a unique blend of modern techno music and classic violin. It may seem difficult to create multiple pieces using only one instrument and minimal vocals, she has created a creative palette of color and originality .
Very good but then it breakIt was cheap Was $4.30 now I can't listen to music in my car all day .
This wallet iPhone case fits everything you need to carry when running to the store or out sightseeing, actually pretty much anywhere that you need to go. Great in places where your everyday pocketbook would be too much, like at a football game or to the movies, etc.  The color on this page makes it look like a dark purple.  When you receive yours it is more like lavender.  A coworker ordered the darker red one and it was more muted than the picture shows.  The only thing I have found that I am not completely pleased with is once you put all of your items and phone in it and place it in your pocket (if you don't want to use the wrist strap that is attached) it is a little bulky in you pocket.  Other than that, it is very convenient and come in many colors and is less expensive on Amazon than the ones I have seen around town .
This keyboard is a great buy.  It is lightweight and the spacing of the keys make it comfortable to type on.  I initially had a problem getting it to connect to my iPad, then I realized I was not doing it correctly.  It works great and I would recommend it to anyone .
I bought this camera bag for my t3i 6 months ago. Originally I had a 17-50mm and a 50mm alongside extra batteries and a lens cleaning kit.When I first started out, it was ok at best.Pros:It held my 50mm, 17-50mm, body, my extra batteries, and a charger, as well as various other things.I especially like the side pockets, perfect for the 'extras' I had in my pocket.There are straps on the bottom, and I occasionally kept a small tripod attached to them, which was nice.The bag shows no signs up wear, and appears to be very rugged.I was able to re-arrange the compartments to hold my gear more securely.Cons:The strap clips don't rotate, so I was constantly having to untangle it.The material is abrasive, so don't rub up against it.The bag isn't exactly super-light. It isn't bad, but it certainly isn't great.I quickly ran out of room as I upgraded my kit.The compartment system is a bit odd. It consists of velcro and padded fabric. It holds things in place fairly well, but it rarely maintains the shape I want, so I sort of have to re-arrange it each time I put lenses back.Way too expensive for what I got.Overall, I thought the bag was very too expensive for what I got. I would suggest investing it a low-key off-brand bag for your camera, and to steer clear of this one. Unless you only need a back-up bag, and don't mind spending too much money on it .
The book was in great condition when I received it.  I couldn't even tell it was used; it looked brand new .
Case it so cute & fits my phone perfectly. Ive gotten a lot of compliments. Shipping ny awesome as well. I didn't expect to get it back so quickly .
Loved this one,toss up between this one,The Wolf and The Dark Knight ,Im glad it was a long book didn't want it to end and love her writing .
It is even prettier than the picture on the website. I couldn't be happier with my purchase. Thank you so much .
This book helped me understand what Celiac Disease really is and what you can do to control it. It explains what the disease will do to you if you don't take control and make the necessary changes in your life .
I have always been terrified about cancer.  Mr. Martin took the fear away when he forced me to stand by him and go through very detailed descriptions of the treatments and outcome of those treatments.  Although I was not in the room with him, his writing made me feel as though I was there in the treatment room with him.  I sat down in early evening and started reading. It got later and later but I could not leave Mr. Martin alone.  Even though my insides were shaking and tears were running down my face, I knew I had to keep reading and learning and supporting Mr. Martin. This book is truly a must read for people who felt like I did about cancer.  After experiencing life with cancer through Mr. Martin's eyes, I know I can beat it.  I am no longer as afraid and I once was and I commend Mr. Martin for his courage to share all the most personal intimate details of this horrific trip he took to beat cancer.  With the knowledge he shares in this book, it will help you in your battle with cancer. Thank You Mr. Martin .
Dev Shannon is a good bad boy.  He is smart as whip and equally creative in getting the job done.  Personally charming with a dash of redneck.  I like the descriptions of everywhere he went in pursuit of his jobs. You feel like you could go to the city he is describing and walk right into the bar he is sitting in.  I highly recommend this book if you want an adventure that you will not be able to predict what is going to happen or how he is going to get the job done. I enjoyed the writing style used in this book, it is always a step ahead .
I am starting to love Mr. Pettigrew and Mr.Martin.  I really loved all the descriptive phrases and the way Mr. Martin moves Mr. Pettigrew through his very colorful life.  No matter what happens to him, Mr. Pettigrew will find a way to stand tall, a man on conviction.  I love never knowing where Mr. Martin will take us. There is just something about a man who will always do what is right even if it is not in his favor to do so.  This book is very entertaining and has a flavor of how the west really was.  I had a margarita and curled up and went to bed with Mr. Pettigrew. A great Friday night read .
Just a bad set of stories. Not very creative at all. But it's free (you get what you pay for) so I give it couple stars for price .
We like the product becuase of its ingrediants, it doesn't have a lot of the additives the other brands have. They do take a little longer to dissolve than hylands other tablets so keep that in mind. Otherwise great product .
We have one for both myself and husband; we love them. Super easy to put on and clean. I do not reccomend front facing carry per doc reccomendations, its bad for babies hips and backs .
My husband being a tall guy we always buy &#34;tall&#34; work shirts for him, this was the first time we bought Hanes brand, and it will be the last. They are not much longer if at all longer than the regular Hanes shirts. They are also much less comfortable than other brands we've bought .
The item worked great but I found it quickly became useless if, like me, you plan to build a stash of milk. It just doesn't hold enough bags. With full 5oz bags it might hold 10 .
I expected that I was buying rooster feathers, but when I got them they were not feathers at all, but more like hair extensions - i'd rather buy something like this at Hot Topic .
I have had this product for about a month now, and they have never once lifted off of the keys or caused any issues with having to reapply them. They are simply 3M stickers that sit right on top of your keys and they look and feel great! They were much easier to apply than I would have ever thought! When I am ready for a different design, I will DEFINITELY buy from this company again .
Subwaysurfers is a very good at a lot of good attempt said Fred Thompson and i know it is a very good at a lot of people who are not the Christmas carols and i know .
So the screen itself is OK. it is an actual screen. Very grainy though but it does the job. The back of the screen is black so no light is going to pass through it which to some is good to some its not. it is heavy and sturdy and that is the sad part too. The spring or the coil that is supposed to keep the screen rolled up is very very weak. So once I am done using the screen if i roll it up it still drops/rolls down quite a bit. there is a metal or wooden rod that is in the bottom of the screen. It is supposed to keep the vinyl in shape and stretched. This rod is very heavy and the coil can't bear its weight so it unwinds. Defeats the purpose of roll down screens. If the coil worked i would give this 5 stars.The arrangement i have is i have used L brackets to hang this from the wall over my window. The whole idea was to use the screen when needed and else roll it up to let light come through the window. now since its half way rolled down; i cant seem to utilize my window. Anyways the set up is very heavy and i lost the box so cant even return it. but if you have other options i would look elsewhere. This screen is cheap for a reason .
Blew off in 1 week. Did not get decent light out of this. Threw away a lampshade to expose the bulb and now i have one that doesn't work. Too pricey for the quality .
I had a complicated set up for my screen. I needed a clamp that can stay perpedicular to each other so i can suspend a screen. It sure did. the slit on the top allows you to suspend the screen at different positions. it comes with all the screws etc so don't need to buy any additional hardware if your set up is simple .
build quality is great. used it for diving and will use it again. the silicon is soft and won't hurt your face. keep in mind it doesnt give you the view of side .
For some reason this product doesn't work that well with apple tv. I wanted a low profile cable to save space and purchased this one so i can stop using my present cable that is very thick. At times this cable delivers signals and at times it doesnt. At first it seemed like a loose connection issue but it isnt. The cable is secure in the Apple TV and the TV and yet it sporadically looses connection. May be its a bad cable or may be its not compatible with apple tv (dont know how its possible .
small and pricey. returned it. found the same one at much cheaper price at target and walmart. did not buy it as i had many options .
so i thought i would buy this because its digital and will give much more approximate weight. one would conclude as they see digital scales at grocery stores when they buy produce or meat. Buy something else. i weight different each time in a span of 5 minutes. Sounds hilarious but its a waste of my money. tried various surfaces, wood, tile, carpet. None helped. you need a calculator to measure your weight. You need to measure atleast 5 times and then take an average. you will really get it right .
It doesn't really secure the go pro that well even after you hear a click. i was diving with this and my hand must have hit something and the go pro slipped out. So i see a sting ray and want to take a picture, the go pro was gone! luckily i traced back and found it but you might not get this lucky if you were say snorkeling. Later on i  attach another lanyard to the go pro screw and attach the lanyard to my hand. Tested this again and if something hits the go pro it slips out. Whats the point? It isnt as tough as the go pro is .
Great box Exactly what i needed. it isn't water proof but its definitely seems like shock proof. Great way to protect the camera .
This book is very graphic. It took me by surprise and I could not put it down because I had to see where it was going. Not my usual type of read but was enjoyable .
This tiny radio works surprisingly good for size.  Using in garage - signals great through walls and once installed, never have to mess with settings.  Very stable .
The terminals were bent or broken on both batteries when received. I do not believe this was caused in shipping .
Too bulky however quality of material and workmanship was great. For someone who does not care about size of case .
This product is excellent.  The size is very compact and doesn't seem like it's larger than it needs to be.  I recently updated my TV from a LG 32in LCD to a LG 42in LED.  My PX21's were connected to the older TV via 3.5mm.  However, the newer TV was missing the 3.5mm port.  Connected an optical cable from my 360 slim to the FiiO, and the PX21's 3.5mm connector into the &#34;line out&#34; port on the FiiO.  On the 360, make sure the audio is set to &#34;Stereo&#34; because any of the &#34;Surround Sound&#34; setting will not output audio to the headphones. I believe if you connect the device to the TV, you change the audio settings on your TV to &#34;PCM&#34;.  I am very satisfied with this product .
I purchased this case as it was one of the few cases I could find that was both matte and red.  The case is very slim and adds barely any thickness to the device.  I keep an extra battery in my wallet and am often swapping out the battery once it dies.  After about a dozen times or so I noticed a small crack coming from the top-right corner of the case.  The case is a very tight fit that requires a bit of force to remove from the phone.  However, not everyone has multiple batteries for their S4.  For those of you who don't change the battery, this case is just fine .
Case arrived damaged.  Pieces of the red paint were chipped and very noticeable BEFORE removing the plastic.  The screen protector was nothing to write home about, and I never planned on using the stylus.  Returned the next day and received a full refund.  My disappointment was short-lived as I also ordered the SPIGEN Neo Hybrid case in red alongside this case .
These are fascinating, multi-dimensional novels that can be interpreted in endless ways.  They are fast moving and keep you guessing about where they are going and what it all means.  Just like real life, the devil is in the trivial details, intentional and unintentional misunderstandings abound, and the irony builds and builds.Many comparisons with the masterpieces are possible (Don Quixote, Candide, Madame Bovary, The Awakening, Bleak House, Strange Case of Doctor Jekyll and Mister Hyde).  At the risk of destroying something beautiful, over-simplifying, and generalizing something that is unique, one could say these books capture the decline in morals, family, business, legal, and social relationships in the United States and document an accelerated trend toward fragmentation, alienation, stagnation, and decay.Maybe it's because we were bombarded with political advertisements for months on end and our country seems engaged in one crisis after the next, but I found myself thinking that these novels are an extended metaphor for how our political and social life has disintegrated over the last few decades.Something happened that caused serious distrust and a change in values.  It is hard to say what it was (the Vietnam War, Watergate, women's lib, birth control, Bill Clinton's Presidency, etc.), but it happened, and there is no going back.  The change manifested very quickly, so quickly that one must surmise that it was something that resulted from strong forces that had built up over a long period of time.The Republicans have values which are tradition-based and logic-bound.  The Democrats' values tend towards the emotional and they seem to relish challenging traditional beliefs and practices.  However, both parties are afraid of bringing their conflict out into the open and waging an honest and public war for fear of alienating the voters (kids in the case of this story).The Republicans do not understand the full extent to which their values are fundamentally in conflict with the Democrats.  Since the Republicans want to preserve the most basic traditional value of civility (bi-partisanship), they are routinely manipulated and co-opted into various agreements.  And of course, each of these agreements and attempts to compromise ultimately exacerbate every problem, rather than solving anything.In the process of their long-simmering conflict, the Country's infrastructure and viability have decayed (housing, education, economy, governance, law) and the U.S. has split into two rival camps.  The Democrats and the Republicans have such different values, taste and preferences and they distrust each other so much that they can no longer talk to each other in any meaningful way.  Periodically, they go to the court or to vote, but neither side respects the judgment that is rendered, and both sides skulk off feeling victimized.  They live in separate houses in the same town but never talk to each other, except when they have no choice, and even then it is to conduct or conclude some transaction.Considering that I am recommending these novels to my friends and family, I am disappointed that my description sounds so dull and humorless.  Enjoy them .
The case has everything you need in a case. The fit is perfect, the slim fit is whats desired, the case has a nice feel and look to it. The stand works just as it should, standing up sturdy in each of the slots. I have had no problems with it and it looks like there won't be any. Handles all the daily use very well .
This touching, funny book has superb insights into the bodily senses, politics, marriage, academia, and regional subcultures, among many other things.Underneath the funny barbs, this is a loving tribute to Oregon's special mixture of East and West coasters, environmentalists and anarchists, do-gooders and cynics. And mixed in with the hilarious spoofs of college professors, there are wonderful meditations on what it means to get the insider's point of view. The particular focus is a young politics professor's attempt to get inside the minds of local anarchists, but the insights into this vexed enterprise apply to much of the contemporary world: the vicissitudes of sudden mass movements, celebrities, and scandals, the frantic drive in the mass media and on the internet to uncover everyone's secrets.But of course all this works only because the writing is so good--gorgeous descriptions, attention to sensual details, beautifully evoked scenes and characters. So I'll just end by listing, somewhat at random, a few short examples:..."[He was] divorced for the flair with which he shined his shoes."Joey (mother to son): "I hope Oregon isn't like Israel."Sequoia: "through the body we reach the spirit, heart, and mind, not the other way around."In short, there's a lot going on here .
Years ago, I found this beauty. The independent ratings spoke volumes, and not one was even remotely negative. I purchased one, absolutely love it - it is spectacular in person and the mother of pearl dial is exquisite!!  Now that I was able to get it at a slightly discounted rate, I purchased two more - one that I already gave as a gift to someone who lamented that she had the very same one and lost it - and was mourning it ever since. Well, now she has it back again, and she actually started to cry after she opened the box and saw what was inside. It was definitely my best gift-giving yet!!If you are lucky enough to still be able to purchase this gem, don't let it go. You will NOT be disappointed. The photo does not show it justice .
This little power pack charged my phone from 45% battery to 100% within roughly 20 minutes.  Since I did not utilize the entire charge ability in one shot, it has plenty of power left before I will need to charge it again.  Great charger. Of all the various chargers I've researched, this one received the best reviews, and I totally agree with them .
It is classic in an understated way. The leather is nice and although it can be a bit challenging to get on the food (wear think socks), the shoe is incredibly comfortable. I do not feel like I am wearing a high heel, and this shoe quickly became one of my &#34;go-to&#34; accessories .
I first purchased this shoe in navy. It was so incredibly comfortable, and looked amazing with ankle-length pants, that I HAD to purchase the red as well.  Just be careful of the patent - covered heel. Once the back catches on something and the heel gets scraped, there is no way to touch it up or fix it .
I have charged it several times, and then attempted to charge my iPhone with it. I can't tell when it's working, and so far it has done nothing even though it was fully charged. It did not arrive with adequate instructions, and I would welcome any suggestions on how to use it correctly.  I gave it two stars rather than one because I figured there must be an error on my part and not totally on the part of the device itself.AMENDMENT TO MY REVIEW:  When I pushed down the small button for a quick 1/2 second, it finally registered with my phone and is charging it now. The error was on my part, albeit there are no decent instructions that come with it.  I am hoping for a quick charge .
I hesitated before purchasing it as I thought it was a bit pricey-especially because I have other low black boots, but the style is very classic and you can't go wrong with it. You do have to be careful when wearing these, because the leather is nice but somewhat delicate. I scuffed the pointed toes the first time wearing them - was very upset, but was able to work on the pulled leather and make it look a little less noticeable.  It is a comfortable boot, and hard to find. But if you treat it with care, you will get a lot of enjoyment from it .
Just what I was looking for.  Had a railroad watch many years ago.  When I needed a new watch, I started looking for a new model.  Although a little hard to find, this model is perfect.  Good size, not too big, light weight, easy to read.I did follow other users tip to fully charge the watch prior to use, it's working great.The Amazon purchase process was also easy and good, delivered right on time .
I loved reading the seeing the story unfold through Hudson's eyes. I couldn't put it down. It's definitely on my &#34;favorite&#34; list .
This is the only food my rabbit will eat most of. And when I say most of I mean every once in a while he will stop eating the green pieces....and then switch to not eating the brown pieces...and then sometimes the red pieces .
Ok just doing this for the extra points because usually I don't do reviews but I gotta hand it to them the game is pretty awesome. The only problem is the controls. It will take a while to get used to them .
HILARIOUS satire movie. So good. There's not a better thing to spoof than the fashion industry, and this movie does it perfectly .
Had some nice cool stuff u can do in the game like never b 4 but the game itself is junk!!!! So very disappointed with this game... I play my black ops 2 more than this game still! They could have done a way way better job on this game.. Black ops 2 is way way better than ghost .
This book was great. It had me holding my breathe and not wanted to walk away waiting to see what was going to happen. Can't wait for the next book to come out .
Loved it can't wait to ready the next book .
I really enjoyed this book! The first one was good and thus one even more. I can't wait to read the next one .
I can't keep away from these books! They are great and I'm thrilled and ready to read the next book to get the next piece of the puzzle .
I cannot walk away from this series! I love these books! They take my breathe away as I read! I can't wait to read the next piece .
I really enjoy reading these books! Great story than that keeps you hooked and wanting more. Drives me insane that they end in cliffhangers! However, you then can't wait to read the next book .
I never been so moved before, the more I read books from Konstantinos, the more developed my magical abilities become... Yes I know you cannot read a book and turn into Aliester Crowley over night, but by performing the rites and techniques you literally see and feel progress, these rites worked for me, and if it worked for me it will for those of you who desire magical development. I was a beginner before I read his previous book Nocturnal Witchcraft, I was also more interested in the left hand path, but once I read the book before I was even halfway done, I was already reaching spiritual and magical goals that I have been waiting years for... I'm am now a dedicated nocturnal witch training for my initiation (a year and a day) and this book gets more and more intense as well as my spiritual, and magical growth... Do not listen to any one who bad mouths this book or author, magic isn't for everyone, and people who have been in the occult for a while might be use to a different tradition, and might not be ready for nocturnal witchcraft... it is true, this book is a powerful book, and  will bring any beginner seeking more power up a notch... Take my word for it .
I have sympathy for all of the people you have given your misleading, and deceiving information to. You are a false prophet... You turn a truthful fact, that has been sacred and ancient and an influence to the holy bible, and you turn it in to a deceiving ego based oppinion to fit your own beliefs. Leave it to the church to twist and mold sacred truth and turn it in to something evil and wrong. My heart go's out to people that are blinded, and might not ever become awakened because of deceiving belief systems and false prophets .
Look I read this book, I even have it in my personal library... Yes there is a lot of information in this book, but this author is common for cramming important information in a 2 or 3 page chapter. It is poorly explained without nearly enough detail. Not only that this author is from Australia, and the rites and rituals in this book are explained with a different setting of elemental invokations. In the Northern hemisphere it's (East: Air, South: Fire, West: Water, North: Earth) while in the book it's different, and the rituals are so poorly explained I can't see any beginner having an understanding... There's a 2 page chapter on astral projection that is just ridiculous, she gives 1 technique explained in 3 sentences. How would any author expect a reader to understand, or even have success with a book written so poorly? She admits herself that her book of shadows is kept secret, and that is probably a good thing...Beginners this is not a good book to add to your collection. Try " Nocturnal Witchcraft, and Gothic Grimoire, by Konstantinos" "Grimoire for the Green Witch,  by Anne Moura" these books will boost your spiritual and magical growth, and is packed with so much more information that is explained with much detail, and is easily absorbed and put to use. Don't waist your money on books that won't be grasped .
Before watching the life of Brian episode I would of gave Season 12 a 5 star rating, I was intrigued by the New style of there episodes... I'v been a die hard Family Guy fan since Y2K, I bought all the episodes on Xbox live marketplace, and amazon Kindle, the reason I loved the show so much was because of Brian and Stewie together, the time travel episodes were the best... I would consider Seth McFarlen an artist, and I'm not going to jump the gun here, but it would be stupid to keep this Vinny character, it would ruin Family Guy for me and many other loyal fans... I really truly hope to see Stewie fix his time machine and save Brian... I honestly don't think I could keep watching family guy without Brian as a character .
It came in a little bit late but not too early too and i thought it might be bigger but its ok .
Good product but doesn't fit into the US plugs sometimes. I need few more but I'll try some other providers.Thanks .
The item in the box was as specified on amazon but I did not like it. Its gooseneck is too hard to operate. Its so hard that the clip which is holding the gooseneck slips if you try to adjust the gooseneck..It doesn't have to be so hard as its just going to hold a cellphone.Disappointed .
One of the screws of the mounting stand was broken. The gooseneck is too hard to bend.  I would not like it even if it was not broken as its too hard to adjust or bend the gooseneck.Go for it if you want a sturdy stand. But if you are looking for something which is soft to bend then this might disappoint you.Hope this helps you to make a decision.Thanks,kk .
this game is awesome, i remember playing it as a little kid and all the fun i had. It's not overly long but it's not too short .
I really thought it would be a nice tote bage.  It was nothing more than a cheap plastic bag that broke the first time my granddaughter used it.  Don't buy it .
Works just like they say! I was actually really surprised on how well they work. There is no possible way to tell they are different than normal sunglasses besides they're not that stylish. Satisfied .
These sunglasses work if you are looking in the same direction of the sun, however, if the sun is to the side of you it completely blind whatever eye is that way. For an example, if the sun is to the left of you, you can't see out of your left eye. Well you get what you pay for .
First of all, these gloves have a terrible bulkiness, making it hard to function the bike controls, and its just not comfortable. Also, they weren't warm enough for me. Wore them in 30 degree weather, for a 10 minute ride. My fingers were frozen! Would not suggest this for cold weather under 40 degrees .
I bought this as a present for my Mother who loves to go on walks, she is very pleased with the headphones. They keep in the ear perfectly even when jogging. They are very comfortable and sound great. Couldn't ask for more with the price .
I love this product, I used to to sew on a jacket of mine. That way I kinda look like Tron, the only thing is that the light is more blueish than green, but I like it that way. Green when off, blue when on!Edit, just FYI it is not water proof, learned that the hard way .
The rumble that it gives is a nice comfortable rumble and the volume does not need to be very loud. The sound quality is very impressive, not Bose quality, but better than I expected. The only thing that is bad about it is that the arm rests aren't very sturdy, as they keep coming loose every once and a while. But If you do as the warning stickers say and don't move the chair with the arm rests or get out of the chair using them, they will be in good hands .
This knife comes out very quickly and swiftly once you get the hand of it. I gave it to my friend as a gift and he didn't get the swing of it very quickly and cut his thumb a couple of times haha, but I had no problems with it. Survival of the fittest I guess .
LOVE IT!It is the most I have ever spent on a watch, but it was so worth every penny.The Analog syncs with the digital time that you set.Has glow in the dark analog, which i'm pretty sure it doesn't saw that in the review.Digital very easy to read, also easy to set and understand the watch programming.The only thing not good is the light. Can't read the digital with it, and doesn't light up evenly .
The product looks pretty good, looks like bacon. However when you put it in your mouth it feels like I am putting a plastic toy in my mouth. It isn't necessarily a bad taste, but neither is it a good taste .
Whenever plugged in, the converter either makes a repeating thumping noise in the audio, or a high pitched tone. I find it unbearable, that is why I give a 1 star .
I got this watch box obviously because it was cheaper, and it still had great reviews!Pros:-Sturdy-Fits my 47mm watch-Very nice lookingCons:-It looks really nice, the top is not glass like it says but it is a nice plastic that looks like glass.-My box did not come with a lock and key, which I did not expect, but I really wasn't going to use it anyways .
You can't tell from the pictures, but there is a glass case back, so you can see it work from behind too! Which I really like. Howver there is &#34;China&#34; on the back which is kind of dumb.I love almost everything about it except for the band.The band is very cheap, and it pulls at my hairs when I put it on. However, you can switch the band .
We are warned not to judge a book by its cover, but in this case we get an accurate taste of things to come when we see the hooded hunter and the anxious yet calculating expression of the hunted.However, the cover must leave out a good deal, like the strange death of her father on his farm in Sheparton, the finding of a possible ally and lover, and the help that comes from an unlikely source.In rating a book by the difficulty of putting it down and by the quality of its prose, I give Play or Die five stars on each. The pace of the action, the ingenuity of the pursued and the glimpse of life in a post-apocalyptic world are blended to into a believable whole. Jo flees and misleads her Hunter while contriving to find opportunities for sleep in those three-hour periods of grace when her co-ordinates are not being broadcast. She has to survive for five days .
Got them to go with my Halloween costume. They're nice, good material, fit my fingers well. I have kinda long fingers and there is some space so if you have small hands these might not be for you. I'll use them for more than Halloween for sure .
I'm 5'10" 174 curvy and I have a big butt and thighs. Brought a small/medium the only problem is my butt hangs out the bottom. I have spanks so it won't be a problem but if you're tall like me and have curves do the bigger size. But if you have a small waist do the small/medium. The material is nice as far as costumes go. Its soft, stretchy material. I also brought the leg avenue crop gloves, very nice and the whip thats in the pic. Love it tho .
I bought this for my new iphone, which was working perfectly fine. once i put this on my phone, all of a sudden i had no service anywhere i went.  I talked to my friend, who is a technology guru, and he told me it was because of the metal on the phone interfering with the radio on the phone. as soon as i took the case off, i had service everywhere again. DONT BUY THIS. although it look pretty cool .
If you like quality do not  spend the cash. I have 5 Birkin inspired bags, Which I bought from a number of suppliers. This one is definitely not BIG, like it says in the picture. The seams appear very poorly made for the price.I compared the inside, outside, size. strength, & quality. And I find it to be the same exact bag i bought on Ebay for $29.00, both bags looks just like leather. The Ebay bag has side rounded double bound seams on the outside. Otherwise, both bags were exactly the same. Only difference is one smells like leather and the ebay one has silver hardware and amazon had gold. I will give it 3 stars only because its leather.  I love Amazon and will continue to buy, but this one is not worth it .
Excellent.  Could not put it down.  Looking forward to reading the next two books in the trilogy.  This is a book that I was very hesitant to read  but glad I did because it is very good with a story behind it .
Thoroughly enjoyed the trilogy.  Could not put the book down. There is an interesting story within the book. A must read .
Very interesting.. An historic and present view of world megatrends with focus on their geographical position and potential conflictsI have not finished reading .
This was a ridiculous Item it doesn't work right you can not sew with these things.I have to return these items and I want my money back .
i have used these razors for years and will continue to as long as they are in production. I have burn scars (2nd degree) and makes it hard to shave,but with these i shave with no hassle at all .
I bought this as a Christmas gift for my brother and he loves it! would definitely recommend! no complaints so far .
i guess i should have read a little more on the description, but this kit looked like it had alot of cutting wheels and such, but really only has a few. the main item it has is sanding bits....i don't own a nail salon so i definitely don't need 50 sanding bits. but if that's what you're looking for then i would recommend this kit .
It's a plastic box.... That holds batteries. Can't Go wrong there! May even end up buying some more! Cleans up the junk drawer pretty well .
I've never had one like this before, but it works great! super easy to clean and work on. i would recommend this to anyone .
This Dremel has already been so much better than the other rotary tools that i have bought! the others fell apart within a few uses. this one seems durable and will hopefully never have to get another one, but if i do, it will definitely be a Dremel brand! you get what you pay for .
it is not exactly the same as a griffin box like i thought, but close. not as thick, which i like cause i can put it in my pocket much easier,but the rubber is really thin, making for less protection. but has worked good so far .
Bought this for the wife, because she couldn't find a women's without pink... she loves it and it keeps her warm on cool mornings in the woods .
sharp edges on the bar should have been rounded off a little. the sharp edges will cut your hand if you're not careful. but the tool does the job .
I don't see it on me kindly I need help now NOW now NOW now NOW now NOW now NOW now NOW NOW now NOW NOW now NOW now NOW now now NOW now NOW NOW now NOW now NOW now NOW NOW now NOW NOW .
I have found this book extremely interesting from the point of view of total lack of knowledge of what actually went on in Africa at that time and the very difficult conditions encountered by those who chose to venture into such an inhospitable continent. As if the conditions were not enough to contend with there were also the natives with their requirements in order to pass through "their land". Sounds a bit like how things are today!!! Having said that I found it written in the very much journalistic form rather than as a novel. I now note this was the purpose of the writing in general.All in all a very good and enlightening read .
Cosplay worthy pin, did meet all my expectations, only problem is that the pin falls of easily. Fast shipping in a ok box with no damage to product .
Beauty and beast collide within a female SPARTAN 3. She is not a child's toy.. these are for posing only! Her details are spot on. The molding is clean and her hands are smaller than most other Halo: Reach action figures. Making it easy to fit amything in her hand! Can be customized. Warning: Her hands and feet camn be broken off with slight neglect. Not for children.. the games aren't for children and the figures arent for children either! Over all she is a stunning addition to my collection, standing back to back with Kat they complement each others beauty and ferocity alike .
This game is a developing BETA preparing for final launch very soon. But that does not affect the quality!Pros:No Super Computer Needed: I play this game on an I3 with 2g Ram. The settings i have are set to Low, there is an ULTRA low.Bring a friend, this game is pure co-opThis game has a never ending war between hundreds of players at once, in land, air, armor, and mechanical beings on maps that are legitimately 250+ square miles across.There is no pressure to buy, you can obtain many things relatively quick.Amazing community: Concerned players, and teamwork. The players i have played with will often heal me, repair me, revive me, work with me, give me ammo, wait for me to get in vehicles, and have taught me tips and tricks with respect. They realize that assisting your comrade is better for you both in the long run, you want as many experienced and alive players with you when the big battles ensue.Men and Women come together in respect: TRUE respect, be you woman or man, the players (at least on Mathersson server) have treated me and mine with respect, just because she is a girl nobody has changed the way they treat her drastically, only for the better.NO WHINING LITTLE CHILDREN: You read that right, i have yet to run into a child in the game who whines or acts like the console community children. Even the kiddies who play the game know that respect is key to win.CONS:Crashes, a few bugs, and weapon "nerfing". In Beta stage the game crashes at least once a day, which up to now has not caused any damage to my account other than the vehicle i was in dissapearing. Bugs are present in more than one place. Weapons for many factions have been altered to attempt to balance the game but there is still a big margain to balance.Go big or go home: Planetside 2 can be played casually but the biggest battles last 2+ hours.Need a Fast Internet connection: At least 1 mbps.Game requires patience: Not for the 360 quick scope... the battles are such large scales they take time and strategy to accomplish. If you do not stick with your comrades you will get nowhere .
Not bad,but not that good.Cheap price and not bad quality.I like it. but  not so much.Recommand to the poor like me lol .
I just received the item today but the plug it is Type A useless to be use in my country then i went to hardware store to find the converter and the worst part is the pump is not working i am so unhappy .
These were so comfy! I had finally ordered these when I was 32 weeks pregnant, I regret not ordering them sooner .
This sucker was hard to put together (I seriously put the crib together much faster). It seems as though the pieces were too tight (I think I still have 2 screws that weren't put in, because there was no possible way to screw it in (in some places). My baby only used it the first 6 weeks (I know it's meant for the first few weeks), but if you're looking into a bassinet (buy one that is a playpen) it would be a smart buy .
I honestly love this bouncer, my feet can tell you otherwise... It definetly will not flop over because of the wide base. I've tripped many times with the base of it since it really sticks out. Other than some jammed toes, my daughter really seems to enjoy it, I would recommend buying! It's easy to assemble and the material can be quickly removed for a wash .
Beautiful and great quality Bassinet! I would have chosen 5 stars, but it was not the easiest thing to put together. I would definetly recommend this product .
Great price for this product. I still use the bassinet part for my 6 month old (since it's so spacious); I still have so much use for it. Don't bother buying another bassinet (I wish I had bought this product first), since my baby grew out of the other bassinet at 6 weeks :(. It was simple to assemble. I recommend this product .
My baby took to this bottle quick. I had no problems whatsoever. They did last long, I already have my baby on the 9 ounce bottle... I would definitely recommend buying .
I'm giving this item 3 stars because I do love this type of organization. Unfortunately, as soon as I got the package delivered I put it to use in my diaper bag, when I pulled them out (still the first day of having it) to show my husband, one of the tabs that hold the hook to the mesh pouch completely tore off &#128544; (so the hook was clipped to the ring without the pouch). I didn't overpack it at all. I didn't want to go through the hassle of taking everything out and returning it, so I'm just thinking of keeping it (I will contact the seller to see if they'll send me one replacement pouch, if possible... If not, then I will return it). I think it's a bit overpriced for something like this to happen .
I love thisproduct! It is so stylish and pretty! The material is not thick at all... So it can be used for winter an spring .
Very stylish! You can fit at most 4 cards (tightly) in the case. Doesn't really protect anything when dropped... But it is nice and I would definitely order it again .
It was simple to assemble and light weight. The only down fall: you have to be careful in how you pack it in the vehicle or where you put it (I thought I was careful), but when it came to taking it out for use (the back part of where the baby sits) curved in (toward the back of my baby) and so did the flap at the bottom of the stroller (where things are stored), also the storage at the bottom (it's hard to fit anything in there. I don't leave it in my vehicle (so it couldn't have been because of the Texas heat). But other than this, I like the stroller. Since there were no reviews when I bought this, I took my chances... If I can go back, I would have bought another one that I was looking into .
good.. but  my daughter hates it. T^TI didn't know what to do&#12619;&#12619; &#12622;&#12622; &#12636;&#12636;Thank you very much .
I bought this for my grandson, age 7 1/2. Not a great reader, he would much prefer to use his Kindle for game playing. However, after a brief chat about the protagonist of this book, he settled down to actually READ it, and was soon engrossed. I read the book prior to gifting it, and found it delightful, fun, engaging and smile-producing, without a touch of sanctimoniousness .
As a lover of fairytales and legends, I found this book to be both fascinating and frustrating. I know I shall have to reread it at least two more times before I understand all the nuances, innuendos and references. However, that didn't stop me from enjoying the stories and progression of the book .
Since I bought this for a Halloween costume, I didn't have any great expectations. It looked synthetic and some of the hair had gotten twisted in the bag so that it ended in a flip rather than turned under. The snood was obviously cheap and didn't want to stay on the wig without a couple of large bobby pins (not a problem). I was able to make it look more respectable (for me, an 'older Cleopatra') by shaking it in a bag with baby powder. That dulled the plastic look and gave it a bit of gray. I would never have purchased this were I looking for a human-hair looking wig, but for what I wanted it for, it worked .
Set up was very easy, but the instructions didn't mention that there is a tiny switch that controls the fountain. When I first set it up I thought it wasn't working because there was barely any flow from the top. Only after I rewashed all parts did I discover the tiny 3-position switch .
I have no problems with it, it is very good keeps from anybody going in its perfect I would recommend it to anybody .
Now when someone questions or still kinda doesn't understand I can show them the bronies documentary. Hopefully it kinda gives an inside look .
Remembering can be a awesome thing especially if you sometimes feel like you can't remember. Its almost new again, if that makes any sense .
Five Stars For Amazon Rekindling That Fire That Netflix Tryed To Extinguish (in my eyes) This ain't an unbiased review at all ima DIE Hard Rugrats Fan .
She Really Talks To Anyone Who Is Listening. I Like Her Lifestyle Of Just Not Caring. I Recommend This To Anyone Whose A Fan Of The Punk Princess Avril Lavigne .
This was my first brony shirt and I honestly couldn't have been more pleased. Since this is #1 it's almost like anything else I get has to measure up. What a way to start .
Let's not just create something to sell toys again lets add plot & background. Why not right ? What's the worse that can happen . . . You mean whats the best that can happen. A Huge Fandom That likes the show so much that they create music , art , games , OCs and or episodes. Lauren Faust herself said she thought people were gonna hate it and think it was dumb. She said every week after the next new episode premiered she waited each week for some sort criticism. Waiting for some hate that never came. Lauren Faust took a chance. I think they really did something right. No I KNOW .
Seen the show heard the music admire the art so why not play the games. I probably shouldn't have because I can't stop playing .
In this case I agree, the first season of my little pony was the best and I'm pretty sure anyone else would agree THAT they shouldn't/couldn't have done it any other way. Which would make people wonder how they are gonna attempt to try to live up with the huge success of the first season. Well just ask the fans how they did. From the beginning of it to the end of it. Boy did they do it up right. I love every single last episode and then there are ones you can't live without .
First of all its welovefine so the fabric is not dumb (sweetie belle joke) duh. Second has anyone actually seen her cause every time she appears she disappears . . . Dang Wizard xD .
I got nearly nothing but positive things to say about MLP:FiM. The only down part is when season 3 ended Lauren Said &#34;That's not the direction I would have taken the show&#34;. So That's always made me wonder how she would have done it. And what if (hypothetically speaking) when she left the show, Hasbro said dnt worry you gave us a winner a sure money maker we'll fill your pockets. I can only imagine that to her it wasn't about the money not even close .
I love this coffee!  I love that I can have it shipped right to my door, no need to go to the store .
It is marvelous! I could never find such a bag in Europe. It is very elegant, very spacious, very good quality. I have already tested it in planes and it suits perfect for business travel. Everyone is complimenting me for it .
I bought this for my husband on Christmas and h ha played it everyday for a month so it must be pretty great considering he had never even heard of it .
My toddler loves the look of the icon and always wants to play &#34;magic dog&#34;. Once he gets on he gets very frustrated. Nothing is straight forward and he has never been able to play a whole game. I can't even figure how to open some parts .
The phases don't go in order so if you are not paying attention right before you begin, you can't tell what phase you are on. You can't pause to find out either. Very confusing and not like the real card game .
This is an ok read if you are bored. It is Short. Not good if you want something interesting or imaginative .
bought this so he could turn the screen if kindle and drive his &#34;car&#34;. there's no turning at all. just a straight road. it's horrible and he won't play it cause it bores him .
I love thus game and play it often, but it is not fair at all. It gives you way to long to answer the puzzle. It's like a minute for each player. If I can't get in soon I just press &#34;give up&#34; because I think it's a cheat to take so much time .
My son plays this game all the time. He loves Umizoomi. He has all the badges and trophies for the first two levels on here, but the others will not unlock. I don't know how many times you have to replay the same two games, but now he's had it for months and is sick of it because it's just to long to wait for something else to happen .
My three year old is addicted to this game. He loves it and plays every chance he gets. I don't like the blood, considering his age, but apparently it's not to hard. Though he has spent a few hours on one level .
The component RGB YPbPr to HDMI converter v1.3 HDCP HDTV Fails to work. I got the right cords. not AV which I want to work... Nope I got green, blue, red, white, red. and oh hey guess what NO SIGNAL. Is it me or does the RGB cord for ps3 work for ps2? If so Then Yeah Faulty Product .
The hole in the bead is so small my size 12 needle couldn't even pass through twice without breaking the bead in half. This happened on numerous beads .
Don't water your time and money on this POS. Average lifespan in these heater seem to be 2 weeks to 3 months. I bought two of the 300w for my breeding rack and one has already quit altogether and the other other is about 15 degrees off. I will never buy anything from AquaTop again. Junk products from a junk company .
Regular DSlite. Came with what was described. Took a while for it start a game and was dusty. God bless canned air. Stylus falls out from time to time since it's not the original .
Works like it should. Really neat and compact just the way they're suppose to be when you got no desk space .
Works. Just make sure you download the latest codes from codejunkies as it does not come preloaded with up-to-date codes .
All around nice case. Looks good and feels good. Very nice cfm fan on the front and bright blue led was a good touch. Only bad thing was that it came with the power button damaged. No worries as that was an easy fix .
Pros: Can be used as an AP, Router, or Repeater. 4 SSID's (Guests) and option to limit bandwidth. Rang far exceeds expectations which was my MAIN issue :). Easy to use GUI and to updates are easy and painless to install.Cons: LED indicator lights aren't as bright but not a big issue.Other thoughts: Using it as an Access Point linked up to original router via Powerline. Signal is great as I can reach it from the opposite side of a split level house as well as the basement. The GUI itself is really easy to navigate and self explanatory if you've never done that sort of thing before. 4 ssids are awesome to seperate the kids if one only reads books online or when playing games. Not the best router for streaming HD video but we had 5 devices with youtube going at 720p there were no issues. So far so good I say. If you're looking for something cheap and it works this is it .
PRO: Does everything you need it to. Powerlines are a great alternative to wireless networking as long as your electric circuitry isn't all screwed up and they are paired. Great data rates :)CONS: Being in a split level house doesn't help this device at all. Reason why I took a star off is that it drops being paired once a week and is very annoying. Tested with another location with only one floor and the issue still remained.Other thoughts: I like it and I don't mind re-pairing it from time to time. Just wished I didn't have to do that but otherwise it's awesome .
Gameboy was a mess! All dirty and scuffs all over it..a BIG let down...wanted to return and could not..bought as a gift also but it ended up being a double gift..so now I'm stuck with a messed up gameboy also has no sound .
I love this item...have fixed several of my CD's, DVD's & grandkids games with it. Love the fact that you can either use batteries or electric (not included) adapter .
My daughter is seven.  She is quite big for her age.  She is tall and quite plump in areas.  Furthermore, I bought this in a size large thinking it would be perfect because that's what she's in right now.  Unfortunately, it is a little snug, but she loves the color.  It's not too bad .
I really love purple so I knew this was for me and the fact that it was only $6 made me even happier.  I dropped my phone once and it had no scratches or damage, except for on the case.  This product is great so far .
This is a replacement for an earlier model of the same unit that had developed a problem that could not be repaired. Amazon was recommended by a factory representative as a place to purchase the product .
Love it works like it should. Had it a few months now run and workout with no problems.Would refer it to a friend .
At first did know what to do with it or how to take apart. Till i read infro on it toke it apart slide note 3 in worked like a charm. No problems with anything .
This book was sooo good!! I couldn't believe all these twists and turns. I can't wait for part 2!! Hurry up .
One of the valve leaks air . Won't stop, only when I put the valve cap on. Checked it a week after it still leaje whem I remove cap .
Excellent delivery service, product arrived before expected, and the leash tape is a very bright, visible-in-evening yellow. However, unlike the product description states, the leash housing (what you hold onto) is not reflective, it's just silver and shiny. And unlike with my other Flexi leashes, this one has no 1-2ft. non-retractable extension hanging out; i.e. when your dog is standing next to you, this leash still "pulls," while other Flexi leashes have 1-2ft of limp leash that won't retract into the housing. That's a great thing because the leash goes slack (and doesn't pull on him or your hand/arm) when your dog is right next to you at a crosswalk or whatever.  Still, this is a great safety leash for evening walking. Just wish the housing itself was bright and reflective. I bought two of these leashes and I've received comments on them from passersby. Most importantly, at night cars can see that your dog is ON a leash .
I'm currently reading this as a book club choice and not enjoying it at all. Maybe because (luckily) I'm not in a position to understand the trials and tribulations of dealing with a sick old parent. I felt the author whined constantly and showed her worst side in this book. In parts she almost seemed mean to her mother. I'm not sure which parts people were reading that were humorous. I certainly haven't found them. Utterly depressing and dull. I don't think I'll finish it, which is almost unheard of for me! Looking forward to hearing what my fellow bookclub members think .
This was a costume for a school project. We actually used it for Amerigo Vespucci. It's small on the sizing though. Stitching on the back of the top came undone straight away and I don't think my repair will hold for many more wears as the fabric is very flimsy. But not hugely expensive and if you're not creative and need a quick and easy costume, then it's ideal .
Excellent earpiece and Mic! Hearing is very clear and talking through Mic is also clear no problems what so ever .
My wife gave me a Kindle Fire for Christmas, and I installed the Facebook app then before reading the reviews.  I encountered the same issue with the news feed as the others.  Disappointed, I uninstalled, and just browsed to Facebook.Tonight, I decided to try it again, and was pleased to see that the bug is fixed, and the app now works properly.  I decided to write this review, so others won't think it is still broken without trying it .
This book is a must read. It is just perfect! My first book by this author and she didn't disappoint .
I don't usually write reviews on books, but this one was so good I wanted to share it with everyone! It is a must read! It's a mystery/romance. My kind of book .
I bought this so we wouldn't keep breaking our Corelle dinner plates. We usually make our bacon in the microwave, it's a lot faster and easier. I use paper towels with this, two on the bottom and one on top, just like I always do. I like it but I don't think it does anything special. It is very easy to clean, with the paper towels it hardly even gets greasy. I will use it for a few months and update again .
I bought two of these and I love them! I bake meatloaf and bread and basically everything I can think of in these pans. I make supper for two people so these are the perfect size. And I can wash them with my dishrag and don't have to scrub and scrub to get them clean. Defiantly nonstick and I will be buying more of Faberware Bakeware. Just love it .
These sunglasses are so dark they are impossible to wear. They have a great price, they came in one piece even if shipping took forever, but just not worth the money. I will NOT be buying them again .
I want to like it so much, but I just can't do it. It is way too bulky. It is 6 1/4 inches wide and 8 3/4 inches long, in my opinion that is just way too bulky. I really need it so I am going to keep it, since I always get yelled at that there is no toilet paper. I will update in a few months if it rusts or anything changes .
I needed another $1 for an add-on-item and these weren't even worth the $2 I spent. They are extremely thin elastic, they do not last at all. I have some Elastics of the same brand I bought at Walmart and these don't even come close to that. I hate them .
I don't usually take the time to write reviews on books, but on this one I had to make an exception. I absolutely loved this book. It was different and very interesting. I can't really find the words to describe the way I feel about this book, but this is kinda the way I felt about this book, it wasn't the best book I have ever read, but I couldn't seem to stop reading. If I had a minute at work I would be reading, and every other minute I had free I would be reading it. I would absolutely recommend this book to everybody, I don't agree with the one star ratings, yes at times the writer should have explained better, but that is why you have an imagination. It was such a good plot that I didn't mind having to use my imagination at times .
I recently received this razor for free from Gillette to try and I must say it is amazing. The handle is very durable and solid and it has the perfect shape. It does not constantly fall out of my hand while shaving. It will certainly not break unlike the cheap dollar store razors that I was using. I would recommend you try this great razor .
I received this razor for free from Gillette, it was such a nice surprise. This razor has five extra thin blades. I have to shave in the evenings otherwise my face and head get razor burns and such, I tried to shave in the morning with this razor too, but I still got razor burns. So if you are a morning shaver it might not work that well for you, but I highly recommend you try it for yourself. It is a five star razor for me!! I am officially going to use Gillette Fusion Proglide Manual razors! I shave my entire head and face every other day and the blades last me for a month or so. Overall great razor this is a must try .
I love this organizer! It is a bit bulky but that doesn't bother me at all. I have mine filled to the max and it is still intact. Like 25oz bottles of shampoo and conditioner, I didn't think it could hold anything that heavy but so far it  is doing just that, there a multiple heavy bottles in this, at least 5. If anything changes I will update my review .
I got the Haute Metal. It has a nice color and if you practice putting the polish on you can get it almost perfect, not too thick but not too thin. I used a dark red for my base color and it looks awesome. Will defiantly be buying more .
I bought this so there would be no more clutter on our fireplace, 8 sets of keys and mail, just gets to be too messy. So I decided to buy this even after reading some of the reviews. There is a small gap, but so far I haven't had anything fall through the gap. We have it hanging right next to the door and it looks great .
I am looking for something to make a nice, but easy bun. Unfortunately this is not it! I tried to use it am it snapped into pieces before is even got to try it out. I emailed the company about it before I wrote a review, they did say they would send me another one, but they never did. So I'm going to recommend this to NO ONE! Please buy one that actually haas a chance at working, this is just thin cheap plastic. Yes it is cheap enough I didn't ask for a refund, but they shouldn't sell something that doesn't work .
Great baking cups, but they bleed. After I baked my cupcakes there was hardly any pink left on them, but lucky me, there was some on my new cupcake pan. I will not be buying them again .
The polish is okay but the color is not nice at all. I have a lot of pink and red polishes, but this one just is not very nice at all. It does shatter nicely if you apply just the right amount .
I love my old sketchers that I paid $60 for, they are about 5 years old with daily wear. They are still wearable with no tears or anything. The only reason I had to have another pair, I wore them while I was working in a kitchen for about 7 months and they are just filthy now. I have also washed them in a machine at least a dozen times. Now I use them for running shoes. I found this pair on amazon for $39.99-at Black Friday. They are hardly worth that money. They look and feel shorter in the front, a lot of the reviews say order a half size bigger, I am now regretting not listening to the reviews. If you are buying a pair on here please consider doing that. Comparing them to my other Sketcher D'Lites they come up way short in my expectations. They are cheaper for a reason. They don't even look as pretty as the ones you look at in stores.  I will update my review in a few months, right now they are a 3 stars to me, if that .
I got this 3-in-1 Gillette Fusion Proglide Styler to try for free via a program run by Gillette. I was excited to try this styler. I can nicely trim my beard and goatee with this trimmer. It is a breeze with this trimmer. it is the perfect size for me to trim. I get a perfect shape every time. There is one thing I don't like, and that is because the hair clogs up everything and it takes quite a while to clean them, but for a trimmer this great it doesn't bother me too much.  I would defiantly recommend this to everyone who is looking for a great trimmer. I can shave and trim my goatee with out taking another three razors in my hand. I can do it all with one styler .
I received this from Influenster to try for free. I liked it but I did not love it. I does make your teeth somewhat whiter but it leaves a weird taste and feeling in my mouth. It is also a bit pricy. I would recommend it to friends, but I don't think I will buy any for myself, but I am very picky when it comes to toothpaste. So it could just be me .
DO NOT BUY!!! It worked for exactly 3 days!!!!! It doesn't even get that hot. It might be cheap buy it really sucks, the light still goes on. It gets slightly warm on high about every other time I turn it on, and the rest of the time I does nothing!! I'm so disappointed .
These are very inexpensive and easy to use. They worked for me. You just have to make sure you only get the tip wet and nothing more or you might not be able to read the results .
The &#34;stainless steel&#34; is coming off of the four small spice jars and they are NOT air tight at all, not even remotely air tight. The canisters are very difficult to close and not airtight either. I would defiantly not buy these again. I would recommend paying a little more and actually get something for your money. These canisters were not made to use, they are for decorations.  I wish I had listened to the other bad reviews, they are telling the truth .
I read some reviews that said it's comparable to the otterbox, and it is absolutely not!  If your talking on the phone for more then a minute the extremely hard plastic part over the camera hurts. Whoever compared it to an otterbox has obviously never owned one, they might be expensive but they are well worth the money. This one I paid under $5 for it and it was not even worth that much .
I would not get this book even it was free it is weird and just plain awful. I got it for free and I will no be deleting it .
I LOVE this. It is just too funny! I gave this to my fianc&eacute; for a stocking stuffer at Christmas. He saw this in pictures a few times and thought he just had to have one. I told him to make sure he never tells anyone from who he got it from since it is a little inappropriate, but very funny .
Best album I have bought in a while! I am definitely glad I made this purchase, you will not regret purchasing this album .
Fantastic read, the ending especially powerful. Reading the story through that particular point of view lends a voice to someone who is not lost. This book was absolutely breathtaking .
Phenomenal love story. So real and relatable, not cheesy at all. One of the best young adult novels I have ever read .
Too meandering, the family too fabulous. Not enough drama between her an  Skandar. There needs to b,, more drama in the book .
You won't be able to put the book down.  A must read. Should be required  of all high schools. Amazing .
Great read. Not too graphic and the depiction of the land was breathtaking.  Lorna was a sweet heroine. Loved it .
My baby is 11 old months and 3 weeks. He couldn't feet anymore in the last car seat it was very uncomfortable for him that he is a little told guy. The recaro Prosport is very easy to put on the car. My baby looks great with the red color he looks great and he sleeps comfortable. In my car looks amazing is very good quality, safe and easy to buckle .
Bill's book showed a lot of insight to what goes on, not only on the track but also behind the scenes. Followed him from his early days till his "retirement". Once again, thank you Awesome Bill From Dawsonville (and family .
Shipped right away had no problems, the description said it had a few scratches but everything is like new ! Have had no problems with it at all. Just a great buy overall. Would but again from this seller .
Looks really fake I: It's far too shiny, it just didn't match up well. Darker than I thought it would be .
This is not the first kindle book that i have purchased where the spelling errors and wrong word substituted has been dreadful.  Perhaps its just me, but I think the amount of typos in kindle books reflect the quality of the product delivered,as for the story - i have purchased book 4 - only because I like to finish a series once started.  It was a nice waste of time to read the series but i really started to be annoyed with the &#34;top of the tallest mountain&#34;, &#34;colder than the coldest night&#34;, &#34;bigger than any monster ever seen before&#34;.  For mine that is a cop-out on providing a meaningful description - and it is descriptions that keep the reader entertained.  The characters had potential however they never really strayed from being good, bad or hero .
I really liked this cook book and I thinkit had some great recipes in it for females looking to lose some lbs. I love some of the fish dishes they have in here and they really came out good when cooked them. Also glad that this was not published by the loser Teresa Jew-d-chay...lol .
This has helped my shoulder pain subside whenever I take the pills. I am taking the maximum dose and although I do not take them every day they work when I consume them. I have not found any joint pills that have helped me s much as these have .
These razor blades are so much better price here than I was buying for at my local store. I love these razors as they give me the closest shave with no abrasions or red marks afterwards. They also last me a long time since I only shave once a day .
These champion mesh are so much better than the mesh champion shorts from years ago. They are very roomy and have perfect length to them. Not too long or too baggy. The pockets are good too since they are not bulky and feel like they are making your hips look wider. They hold a good deal of stuff and nothing falls out either. I will be buying more pairs soon I'm sure with diff colors .
I used to buy cellaplex from Costco but it was $39 per bottle. I found this 3 pack deal for so much cheaper! This is great since it allows me to consume the most potent dose and not hurt my wallet at all .
Bought this for my girl for Halloween and it fit just like the picture advertised. The wet look material looked really hot and the way the suit stretched to match her curvy body was amazing. I was hoping these suits were legit and not some cheap polyester but they were nice and stretchy so the spandex was perfect. My wife is 5'4 and 125 lbs with D cups so the small was HOT on her .
This storage box is not big but just perfect for jewelry and such. The box looks very good only desk and does not stand out looking odd like others boxes I have had. The craftsmanship on the box is very good I feel .
This was the perfect gift for my friend who can Not stand Obama and his dictatorship...lol...my friend will be whipping his rear with all of the chief's facial assets....classic .
At first this shirt was good but after washing a few times it lost the tightness and did not fit as well. I will be returning this shirt for a refund unfortunately .
I am not sure why other reviews say this is not what was pictured because I got exactly what was pictured. The skirt was nice and shiny and fit tight. It had some give to it so it allowed me to move without constricting. Quality material too so pleased with that as well .
I bought this retail model and after 2 weeks it died on me. I was not happy at all so luckily I could return it. I went and bought the Airfloss Dental Pro Model since it said it was a lot better. Well I am happy to report that the dental pro model is still working fine after 3 months. The battery life on the pro model is better too from what they said. That's being said it worth the extra money .
Revagin face cream did the job in erasing almost all the little lines and wrinkles I had around my eyes and mouth. I did not have deep lines so the improvement was not drastic but enough for me to notice and since these lines bothered me I am so happy .
This doubly shirt was very form fitting and the material is super soft and pliable. I like the contour of the neck and the length of the body is longer so it does not ride up on me .
I am not finished reading it yet and I already know that this book will be one of my refer back to share a chapter with a friend.It is a great faith builder book .
Thank you James Fraser.I found the teaching an answers on creamation. I was thinking of being cremated. Well it won't work for me.because I love the Lord.an also I was looking at it for all the wrong reasons.I am so glad that the Lord has worked with me to look for knowledge an prayer before I do anything. THANK U .
I am still waiting for this cord, It has been well over a month and i still haven't received it so how am i suppose to rate it. I am not pleased with your service .
My wife bought this for our first born. It's magical. The vocals are amazing, the songs are beautifully arranged, the lyrics are sweet and the melodies are wonderful. We put it on every night for the little one and I can't recommend it enough .
My wife and I both agreed that the best actor in this film was the dog. Having said that, he was an exceptionally gifted dog actor, so it's swings and roundabouts.Plus points: The action sequences are brilliant. Really good, and have much better pacing than in the book where they are somewhat ponderous and muddy in the detail. Also, some of the more laborious bits of the book are left out, so when it does eventually get going (after about the first 70 minutes), it's pretty good.Minus points: The lead guy is a muchness. The lead guy's dad/guardian is cold and unlikeable, pretty much binning the character from the book. The woman playing number six has something of a "Mid-Pacific" accent, veering between Australia and the US on a sentence-to-sentence carousel of linguistic wonderment. The whole of the first hour is pretty dull. I was going to say terrifyingly dull, but that romanticises it somewhat - it's just dull.But there is enough going on to keep you interested. Don't read the book first though - I guarantee you'll be disappointed .
THIS IS SO AWESOME! THE MOST FEARED GOD CARD IS NOW A LEGITIMATE TOURNAMENT PLAYABLE CARD! This is a MUST buy for anybody who is a fan of Yu-Gi-Oh. It came in MINT condition! Nothing better to ask for .
There were many inconsistencies and impossibilities in this movie. And the alien looked like a bad Halloween costume. If the alien is sort of the main focus it should at least be done well. I would never watch this again. Waste of time .
I usually don't write reviews, but this book was just that good! It kept my attention the entire time and I finished this book in one sitting because I could not put it down. Great book and cant wait for the next in the series .
As of right now the game quality for the PC is terrible. When you can actually get the game to run and finish a game (which is very rarely), the game play is fun and graphics are great but out of the 10 games I played last night I only finished two. The rest of the games ended with generic "something went wrong" messages. I am very disappointed in the quality and I am frankly tired of game producers rushing their release dates for shoddy game play. However as I speak new patches are coming in everyday to better the server issues, and as I mentioned before the game, when functional, is fun and worth the $60.00. What you would be getting at this point in time isn't worth $20.00. My advice would be to wait for Black Friday and get a better price and hopefully by then, a better product following all the up coming patches. Really wish I would have waited instead of pre-ordering .
the charger slot doesn't fit the charger, so I have to take it off the phone every time I need to charge it .
Bought this item for use when running, Velcro sticks well as have bought one before and it came undone as running but this one is good. Good size for my arms which are not skinny (but not fat either), fits tight around phone so good for listening to music as running. In general, this is a good product, which worths for money .
The boots are absolutely beautiful.  I bought a size 8M (my true size), and the zipper wouldn't go up all the way....I have other boots no problem....thought ok, I'll try an 8W  still no luck, this is definitely for a SMALL calf....boohoo .
I was looking for something new to read a while back and I just happend to find thie fated saga series I could not stop reading it is so great and after I was done with book 1 and found that there were many I was so happy it is an amazing series I recoment it to everyone .
You paid $10 for a polo?  Guess what you got?  A $10 polo!  Not the best quality, not the worst .
It's absolutely terrible. It leaves spots on your teeth and it's painful. My teeth hurt for days afterwards. Do not recommend .
I really liked the zipper on the side and the velcro on the other. I have bad hips so bending over to try and get my feet into other boots is hard. But with these i can just slip in the side and with a quick zip be ready to go. I would highly reccomend to anybody whos not very flexible or has joint problems because of how easy they are to put on and take off .
I was kind of disappointed with this card stock.  It is not as smooth as the Neenah Super Smooth White card stock and you can't blend alcohol markers as well, but it works just fine for digi stamps using colored pencils .
One of the best records ever made. If you don't own it then stop reading reviews and just buy it .
The brim was not as firm as I would have liked it to be but really nice hat and comfortable .
Not my favorite, but still awesome and pretty amazing considering their age and the fact that they hadn't been a band in over 30 years .
Cord did not work. Wasn't worth the shipping to return it. I plugged it in.....nothing. Finally got another cord and it worked fine .
I loved this book.  I see it as a true love story.  It made me believe that good men and people exist. This give the message that you are never really alone. I will recommend to my book club as book of the month. Congras  and a very good read .
I LOVED FLECHER/BREEZE. IT WAS FUNNY HOW HE WAS TRYING TO FIGHT FOLLOWING IN LOVE AND I LOVED HOW SHE HANDLED HIM.  SHE INITIALLY NOTICE HIS PROBLEM AND NEW HOW TO HELP HIM DEAL WITH IT AND HE NEEDED SOMEONE, BUT WOULD NEVER REALIZED IT UNTIL HE MEET HER .
Love this game! Very fun! Have it on my kindle fire hd, good graphics. Just wish character cards didn't cost so much .
When I click on friends and gifts, the box pops up to enter my character name. Can't get to my friends or collect my gifts. Fix these issues and I would give this game five stars, I do really like the game .
I came across this game online while ordering another game and had never heard of it.  It had great reviews so I decided to try it out.  We were really pleasantly surprised by how entertaining and educational it is!!Try it for all ages!!  Makes great family fun .
It has a selection of different sounds so it doesn't get boring.  My daughter uses it to help her fall asleep and she finds it really calming and soothing .
I ordered this dvd for my car since it had a decent rating.  It doesn't work properly.  First of all it takes a long time to start playing a disc and then it gets stuck for no reason.  I put in new dvds that definitely weren't scratched and still had the same problem of taking a few minutes till it started playing and then it constantly stops in middle.  These problems are from the beginning it never worked properly.  I'm also upset because I spent a lot also to install it into my car.Do not buy this product unless you are looking to through out your money .
This is a great little recipe book for soups there isn't very many but the ones that are there are all reusable .
Comfortable and stylish. Good to wear for casual or dressy. Good fit and height. The incline is comfortable and doesn't cause any pain during wear. The height of the heel is about 2 3/4 inches and was perfect for me (5' 4&#34;) so I could pair them with a long maxi dress. I would highly recommend these, especially for those who want more height but are not used to wearing heals .
I was a little weary that it wouldn't be able to blend ice or would burn out.I've had it for a little over 2 months now and its great, I love that I can just screw on the top and take it to go.Love it .
The quality isn't great, but that is to be expected for the price.I like it mainly for the case and all the smaller brushes it comes with for eyeshadows and lips, etc.The face brushes are not soft.I'm not a huge makeup fanatic but I could tell the quality wasn't great.Fast shipping though and as not bad considering the price .
I like this shirt- however I was expecting a lighter weight material (probably my own fault for not reading the description throughly though!) This is a medium weight cotton material.I really like it though- the fit is loose and the quality is excellent. Just to note the pink logo- writing is shimmery! Again not what I was expecting, but I like it! Under Armour is always a great choice .
Perfect height as well. I have no worries of my keyboard falling. Did not come with instructions but I figured it out .
I liked this product. It's a good product and a great gift. My friend had been complaining all year long about how he can't drink beer and play Call of Duty at the same time. Well guess what I got him for Christmas .
If the SF series we watch these days would leave this much for the audience to wonder, not to tell them everything that will happen in the cliche storyline in the pilot already, then I would say the good science-fiction is what we watch. &#34;After&#34; does just that, leave parts of the plot to the viewer and in the same time makes the show much more suspenseful and much more interesting than it would be if the same old cliche storyline is served over and over again.Acting in the first half of the pilot is great, further in the pilot some things are slightly illogical, (they all born on the same date ended on the same parking lot?) but in general this is very good pilot which by atmosphere reminds on the first (and so far the best) season of &#34;Walking dead&#34;. I would really like for the series to continue so that we can see what's hidden and what is that screenwriters left for us to discover.Recommend to all, but mostly to CW and SyFy screenwriters, because this is how you make an SF series and not that corn stuff we watch on those networks .
It doesn't. Work  do not buy this company is liar.warning don't buy products Tom this company  I repeat do not buy .
I am very pleased with the phone case. The price is excellent. I shopped around before purchasing and I didn't even see a fraction of the options I saw on this site and what I saw was 5 times the price I paid here .
I loved this book and can't wait for part 2. Please get it out for the readers as soon as possible .
I loved 1-10...now I need book 11. Please let me know when it will arrive. I can't wait to read more .
Where or how do I find the next book....The Playmaker?????? I can't find it. Please help. I enjoyed the first one ALOT .
This product was not satisfactory at all. Sound was so bad that I had to return it. I would certainly not recommend this item to anyone. I was very disappointed in this particular cassette recorder. However Amazon did handle the return so well.  Very efficient. Don&#34;'t order this item .
Cool awesome story loving great fondness for the others were not the only one that could help them with their own way to get out of the problems in this story .
I hate it!! It's way to hard for me. The last game I played was even better looking at poo!!!!! FLAPPY BIRD SHOULDN'T HAVE LEFT THE APPSTORE EVER .
I have very fine hair and this is a great product that does not weight my hair down. LOVE IT .
the ears break way to fast and the case is just way to cheap don't buy it .

i haven't gotten it in yet but i can tell already that i willl love this case !!1! :D :D :D .
If I have to pay for it, it should be the whole book, not bits and pieces of the book .
I'm a home remodeler I use the floor nailer often enough to be able to tell you it's good, I don't recommend it to anyone using it on a daily basis .
Again, a beginner so I don't speak for quality but they work just fine! They did seem to come loose but I don't know if that's just a trait of cheap boots .
I'm pretty new to boarding, so I can't speak for this board's quality, but for a beginner, can't get better lol .
This digital dash I's a ripoff stare OK but after is complete messed up. Do I do not recommended to no body .
After going through FIVE Lifeproof cases (insane!), I finally tried the Catalyst + Survivor case. Overall I was happy with the case; the design, screen protector, and audio quality were excellent. BUT, there is one major flaw, the plastic that covers the camera lens completely blurs all of your photos. I have tried 2 different cases, both with the same problem. So unfortunately I cannot recommended this case to anyone who takes lots of photos with their iPhone.I hope Griffin will fix this issue, because it's a great waterproof case otherwise .
This effort put forth by the author clearly involved her soul and I highly recommend this to anyone who feels afraid to follow their heart. This book is raw and honest to the core. It leaves no stone unturned in telling one person's journey to the other side of the world with only herself as her guide. The lessons within can be applied to any journey no matter if its Singapore or to that next job interview down the street. It teaches courage, self confidence and realization of oneself. In it is found internal struggles that all humans face when taking any kind of leap to where they want to be. It tells us how to make something out of nothing. Not everyone will succeed but we all must try. In that we will be satisfied .

I am 12 years old and my friend and team mate has the bat and one day he hit the ball really good and it hit the top of the fence but it was not a homer but it was close and today he did the same type of hit and it bounced of the guys mitt and rolled under the fence and the person who played outfield did not put his hand in the air so he ran all the way in and it was a run.But if you would like to know the details it has grate grip it looks super good it is legal for all tournaments and it is all composite it's one of the best bats I know and a another good bat is the Easton that is black and yellow don't know the name but it's in my wish list if u are interested in it .
buen producto muy calientito y no pesa de excelente tama&ntilde;o, estoy muy contento con el producto, el unico detalle es que se arruga muchosaludosPedro .
Muy bonita novela.  Triste y conmovedora. Deja una bonita ense&ntilde;anza y tr gu&iacute;a a apreciar lo bueno y lo bonito de la vida .
got this for my son for xmas. didn't realize u need and external hard drive just to play the game. It was not in the description at all so he now has a game he can't play that he was dying to get. doesn't work on the xbox360 4g without the drive .
I purchased 2 of these for my boys xmas presents. the first one wouldn't close on the top and then it broke 2days later. The other one fits his phone but u can't hear him when u call his ohone. Its blocks the speakers and his cracked also. Total waste of money. JUNK .
First of all, it is not illegal under BATFE rules to have this conversion as long as this conversion is done by a certified gun smith; the proper tax stamps and paperwork filled out. Just make sure that you also ensure that it isn't against your state law in owning a weapon like this.For you newbies out there, if you want a full auto weapon, the SKS is not the way to go, and you shouldn't be trying something like this anyway. If you screw it up, you will have a runaway (weapon fires on full auto without trigger compressed) this can lead to serious consequences for you or some innocent bystander. If you want full auto weapons, then look into the AK47, Galil, M-4 Carbine or LAR-47, these weapons were designed to operate under these conditions and need no conversions, just a background check and a lot of money.Don't be the retard that gets the pretty silver braclets for going about it the wrong way .
The quality of product was really bad but I guess that's what you get for a cheap knife. I would never buy this product again .
Wore it at casino every night for 4 days.  Got no response from women at all.  Would not recommend this product .
It is hard to concentrate on only one part of the story, your head cannot stop at one line but explodes into many storylines. Great book, wonderful writer .
They fit great colour is gorgeous and the material looks and feels good quality. I've not washed it yet. They suits up to hip .
I was in doubt as to the size but it fits perfect. I am 1,58m and it gets down right at my knees. It feels warm and light at the same time, good cut, it doesn't make me feel like a bear, it makes a nice shape. Wide enough sleeves for you to move freely. I love it .
It feels soft and very warm. Sequin do not pinch your skin. Very nice material and looks elegant as well .
Wonderful colour and texture.It fits elegant with a pair of office pant and also informal but chic with jeans. The fabric is not heavy and falls great .
It is a beautiful shirt, soft and not so transparent as it shows in the pic. The colours are much more vivid than the picture. Looks great with jeans .
I haven't washed it yet but the fabric looks like those which get smaller looks better than feels, the fabric looks cheap .
It was a good book right until the ending I cried the ending I did not enjoy it didn't wrap things up like I thought it would. Not only did many loving characters lost their lives but the heartbreaking sadness towards the end .
It was an OK book if you ask me I would not buy it it isn't worth the money It is a poor book I'm glad I have prime .
theses are a great value!  being diabetic with no insurance I have to save everywhere I can and these save me a lot every month .
I lost my dog not long ago. I was really heartbroke. I ordered some books on dogs going to heaven but they didn't seem to help. I then bought "Biblical Proof Animals do go to Heaven". I cried, I laughed, and it educated me. But mostly I know for sure now where my beloved dog is. This book is amazing. It has bible proof and a beautiful story that once you start to read it, you can't put it down! I give it 5 stars!! If you read this book you will have no doubts that your pet is in heaven .
I was expecting something a little more structurally sturdy.  Once I opened the package I knew it wasn't going to be a good case. The front part is extremely flimsy and broke upon putting on my phone. I do not recommend this unless you are willing to &#34;pay for what you get&#34;. The shipping took too long and was definitely not worth the wait .
I love my uggs.  They are super warm and fuzzy.  If I wear them ALL day (I work from home), my feet feel like I'm walking on concrete, but great for not walking around in all day .
When the Uggs arrived, the fabric was REALLY fuzzy and looked like they had been worn for years on the fabric, although I know they weren't because the sole was new .
the earphone is suck!!! not louder at all!!! but the bass is okay for the price and i am not okay with this earphone .
the isound i have try out is good but not that very good like you pay cheap headphone you get cheap sound and for me i not using i give my sister to use hehe .
5 stars, it arrived on time,the parts are original and did work perfectly on my laptop. It did not overheat, functions perfectly hope it last .
I've not received the product yet. It doesn't even have a tracking number so I can know where is at. I'm worried .
So beyond pissed off. I bought this because it was said to be unopened with just the outer plastic ripped off. NOT TRUE! The whole thing was obviously re-shrink wrapped, the box had a piece of tape where it would have had it seeled but that was cut... a lot of the pieces had the color of it falling off the foam pieces. So aggravated and feel like I was lied too. I don't even want to put it together now .
the story is quite irony. however, I cannot understand some of the expression. the English is quite old caused me confuse sometime .
I have been using the keyboard for about 3 months. It has been as sturdy as the first time. Typing on the ipad mini is now so much better! One dislike is the fact that the keyboard does not work when we have to log in to a wifi network at a hotel. When a pop up screen appears for me to key in the passcode, I cannot seem to type uding the ZAGG. I have to open a document, type in what I need to, then copy and paste it on the pop up screen. Another issue is that the play or pause buttons cannot be used on spotify.Otherwise, I think its a great typing tool to have. Thanks .
Tuff to site in but once you do its great. Hopefully it will keep me from having to use my weapon. Only a fool would not respect the red dot if they break in my house .
All the neighborhood kids can see it I don't mind being the guy they think is paranoid. This sign prevents stupid acts .
Needs more air space and mounting depth than pioneer ip-flat subs. Not truly a flat sub little less mounting depth. Was surprised to see a magnet on back. Pioneer definitely has this beat .
They sell it at Walmart in camping area no difference in material at all. Price not far off but this product is made well .
It was okay i expected the box to be worn, but not opened I don't know if the film was pressed or not .
It was okay i have no completes. I expected everything I bought. Took me only a about half an hour to finish on project. I bought this to build a 3D model for my science project and I could not be happier. I am I will be getting a 100 on that .
cool bro its very good d . i love it  because its  magic thingi serious i am not jocking.Buy that see that effect .
Not a bad read. Better than l thought. I did figure it out about half way through. All in all it kept my attention for the duration of this book .
A romantic mystery that was not too bad. I am not keen on romance stories, but this one was tolerable .
Different from what I am used to reading. Not a bad read all in all. Might try another one some day .
This book started slowly but I  couldn't put it down for the last couple or three chapters. I was not too surprised by the end though .
Cherie Priest has mastered that fine line between vernacular wit and sophomoric daily diary sort of stuff.  In other words, she writes the way people talk, but not only that, she writes the way SMART people talk, and manages not to write any of the stuff you're going to want to skip.  I was a fan from the first page I read (which was in her first book in this series, "Bloodshot"), and hope this turns out to be a long series .
Terrific book, and a very long book!  Reading it on my Kindle I didn't realize how long it was, but I was thrilled to continue reading, and reading this book.  The writing is excellent, and you will be transformed into the ever changing life of the main character.  I loved it, and continue to think about the events that occurred, considering what it all means...  The author is brilliantly gifted, and tremendously knowledgeable about life in contrasting states and circumstances.  It's a read that you will never forget .
the sound was fuzzy and the quality was low, I do not recommend. the only good thing was it arrived fast .
It was not even a frozen doll...it was a cheap knock off...it said Bamin Anna on in....Im SO furious...this was for my daughters b-day..and I paid A LOT of money for it .
ARE YOU JOKING ME.... the doll does not look like this... not the same outfit... hair crazy not in a braid... I am so mad right now .
I haven't gotten the chance to read this book yet, but I saw the movie and I am very excited. This book was about $5 and I believe it was worth it .
It's pretty good, I haven't read the newest book in the series though. I have been playing video games more than reading but this was a pretty good buy .
Never finished the book, when I bought it I thought it was the next book in the series. I only got half way through, and I was very bored when reading it. I guess it was my bad for buying it under false pretenses .
This was a free buy, Tim Mettey came to my school to sell this product, I looked it up on amazon and it was free. I haven't read it yet, but I am sure its a great book for being free .
Was for a good price. Never finished it, not sure why now that I think about it. Anyway, I would consider buying this item .
I gave Waiting to be heard a five star review because it was beautifully written and it never steered away from the heart wrenching truth Ms.Knox went through. As she aches and fights for freedom it she manages to stir that up in reader as well. I recommend this book to everyone  it's  story people of any age need to. It serves as an important piece of history .
Started peeling after a couple of days, did not fit the device correctly.Was not able to open the slide with this case .
I bought these for my Mom and the slippers were delivered way ahead of schedule. She was very happy with how they fit and the amount of cushion they had.  She has never owned a nice pair of house slippers before, usually cheap Walmart specials. She liked the thickness of the soles and how she can walk out to the mailbox and not feel every little pebble on the driveway. My Mom is always on her feet and she said she will never buy another cheap pair of slippers again after wearing these all day .
I have tried just about every name brand sunglass out and none compare to the fit of Bolle's. I have a pair of Costas which cost me 200 plus and I am scared to wear them because they scratch so easily.As many stated, yes they are a very large pair of shades, but if you have a bog noggin and like the coverage they provide against the sun on the Water then these are for you. I work in the Gulf and nothing compares. I have owned Bolle's in the past and been sold on the quality and lasting durability for years.Here's the but, the float head piece does not fit over the ear section of the sunglasses, so it's useless and I really wanted to use it. I drive boats and I have had sunglasses fly off before to be lost for ever.Bolle, you need to send the correct head float with these sunglasses .
This is probably the best deal on the Internet for my Samsung Galaxy S3. I paid under 3 dollars for the case. I was very reluctant at first because I was thinking no way this case is going to fit,, something has to be wrong.... Nope, it fit really snug and is very slim along with a belt clip holder.  I don't recommend it for a construction worker or some one who works out doors, but it does have a belt clip that faces the phone inward which protects it.Don't pass the deal up .
I watched the gold box timer like most of you and when it reached zero i rapidly clicked on it, saw the price and went straight to check out. I look at it like this, if you was one of those people who needed to see specs first, you missed out on a 50 inch TV for 288 dollars. I don't care what brand it is, for that price and yes Walmart customers have given this TV decent reviews for twice the amount. This won't be my family TV, perfect for a game room.. Man cave.My TV gets here on Friday and I will update.You can always clear it out of in box if you didn't want it. Just my opinion .
Didn't like. Only for children. Kinda boring. Trailer makes you think it would be better... I wouldn't watch this movie again .
I love this moisturizer. I've been using it for 1,5 months I can say and it makes my skin feel and look amazing. So far I love all the Mama Mio products. The ones I tried so far, Clean Slate, Eye Know and this one, all have Aloe Vera as the first ingredient. No wonder these products feel so good .
I was hesitant when ordering the item because of a review stating the stand is not high enough. I measured mine at just over 7 feet tall. For my family's purposes this works out just fine.  The assembly was not complicated at all and I was expecting much more of a project. I received mine 3 days from the time I ordered. I must live fairly close to an Amazon fulfillment center .
great stuff have tried several nothing comes close to this !!!!!! i have lost over 30ibs , i love it there is no side effects at all .
I really like this handle and how it allows the razor to move.Every other handle i've used had razors built in which never allowed it to move with my face.I'm able to get a great grip so I can make sure I have total control which means less cuts.I'd like to say I was lucky enough to try this for free thanks to a program from Gillette .
I used to use cheap razors with only one or two blades and they done alright but I'd have to go over them more than once which always results in razor burn.This razor cartridge is great has five small blades which means gets more hair and causes a smooth shave. I've not once broke out since using this and I honestly don't think i'd ever go back.I was lucky enough to try this for free thanks to a program from Gillette .
I bought this unit for my hunting camper and very well please with it. Had good water flow and great range for heated water.Temperature control doesn't have to be wide open to get the right temp. If  you have a hose connecter close by you can have this unit going 10 minutes, very easy to hook up .
Took with CAMBOGIA and I lost 10 pounds in 2 1/2 weeks eating what I normally do. That gave me the push to cut out soda, then lost 10 more. Since seeing actual results I'm trying to eat healthier. Pills do not make you jittery or gassy/poopy .
My game now freezes constantly. The game itself is very fun but I can't even play it when everything is frozen and stuck. Very annoying .
Unlike temple run, brave is really hard to get her to jump and side to side and I have to push hard on my tablet and really do not like that. Other than that it is okay .
Really enjoyed this read! Marta Perry always writes great books. I read them out of order and it wasn't confusing. Loved the book would recommend .
This game is very addictive! I haven't had any problems!!! I recommend eveyone get this. Fun different games so you don't get bored and it makes it more interesting that you have to continue to play your unlocked games to earn more coins to unlock others! I already played 3 hours straight and I'm sure many more hours of fun are sure to follow .
Love this game! Slow generating coins at first but when you get to higher levels it's not too bad. Was on level 100 then had to swap out my kindle and even after syncing I lost all my prizes and started at level 1! Really mad I spent money to get coins, don't think I'll do that again just incase I have another problem with my kindle .
whenever I paint my nails I put this on as a top coat, and in about 10 minutes my nails are perfectly dry. I love that they become really solid, because I hate walking around trying not to touch anything in fear of messing my nails up. the one thing I will say is it does make my nail polish peel, it won't chip, but if you get nervous and play with your nails, I wouldn't recommend this for you .
I am very happy with this product. The spring-loaded buttons on the side fits very snugly into the lighter socket. It charges my iPhone 5 at a high speed and stayed charging throughout, it never once fell out of the hole. It also has a very elegant, simple design. Once it is plugged in, a blue glow will indicate that it is ready to be used with adds an awesome effect especially when driving in the night. Another plus was that this product was also delivered very promptly as I received mine within a few days of purchasing it. All in all, this product is very sturdy and is certainly NOT a low quality charger. Im truly impressed with this product and it is definitely worth paying the price for its high quality .
This game is really awesome and I'm.  Kind of picky person but this is really epic so yeah I recommend this game to play an d it is free so play it before it not free .
Waste of money and Im so disappointed. It does not fit my phone. Not even worth one star honestly. I want my money back .
okay, i hate Thomas. he is annoying and clings onto Cia like a child (not that children are terrible). i hated him even in the first book and the second he was just worse. I like Ian and think him and Cia should be together. Thomas is stupid and annoying and i hate him and he killed someone and hes evil and cia and ian should be together and thomas is a sack butt okay goodnight even though its only 5 pm. okay rant over .
Funny group of girls plus romance plus talent. The musical version of Mean Girls in a way... What's not to love .
I have become a super Dark Knight fan and this was just what I was looking for. I had seen others but I'm glad i bought this one. And because its black i can wear it with anything plus black is my favorite color. All of my friend now want to buy it off of me or want to borrow it. I don't see many girl where snapback so this really made me stand out too. Batman Fan all the way!! Plus i got it in 2 days, rite on schedule .
This product is good, has a lot of styling options and works very well. However you have to charge after every use because the charge doesn't last long, but other than that it is a good product especially for the price .
I love this shirt. I just got it today and it was a very nice surprise because it came much faster than it was estimated, perfect fit. Great Material, soft and stretchy, didn't ride up .
This is a great expansion. But then again, I love the whole set.. Can't wait for more.  Just wish I would spend more time playing .
I must admit that I did not purchase this because of the NFL team but for my favorite high school band, Lake Brantley High school band.  Can't wait for marching season to show my Patriot pride .
My little artist girl really love this gadget.  She is very talented and this just broadened her talents even more.  I can't get her off.  Now I have to get one for me .
I must admit that I did not purchase this because of the NFL team but for my favorite high school band, Lake Brantley High school band. I take my lunch to work with pride .
In the comfort of my bed, I can do almost anything. Great resolution and so far, I can't think of anything I would love except for.. dual cameras.  That would be the only thing missing. Great device .
This is probably my most favorite expansion along with Seasons.  I haven't explored all of what this game has to offer but I am sure the more I play, the more I will enjoy .
The top is 6 and the short size 4 it looks good but the y mix the size and i Think i can't return for my money back .
The phone worked well initially but started giving issues after a month, After placing a call I couldn't hear anyone on the other side while they could hear everything that I spoke, I initially thought this is a problem with my telephone subscriber and not with the instrument and went from pillar to post to get this sorted but unfortunately it turned to be a instrument fault. I am outside the returns window and  need to loosen my pockets on another instrument .
My son purposely entered words incorrectly and it came up with words that are not close to what he was trying to spell.  We are back to using the childrens spelling dictionary .
This was my 9 year old son's Christmas present. I priced them at the music stores.  They were very expensive.  This one was a good price.  It came just before Christmas and packaged nicely.  It doesn't take up a lot of room.  The guitars (3 different sizes)don't fall out...which is a good thing  :-)  I would highly recommend it .
HAD to buy Shadow Pass. I read library copies of Eastland's other two Pikkala novels. but the library didn't have Shadow Pass.  It was just as good as Eye of the Red Tsar and Archive 17 .
Wow, this really stands up to the buzz about garcinia. My friends are happy about my weight loss, but what is amazing to me is how easy it makes it to not be hungry when I am usually craving snacks or sweets. I just have this relaxed easy feeling during the day that feels great. I feel energized but not hungry even during the later afternoons when we usually grab a coffee and a treat. I don't need the treats to get me through. I'm all about the occasional treat but now I feel like it's a choice rather than a quick sugar high to get me through the afternoon. I'm more than happy with the garcinia and like that it's natural and safe. The weight loss comes naturally without the snacking because I'm using up the fat stored in my hips - thank God .
This book follows the story of Edith Campbell Berry, and the collapse of the League of Nations as Europe moves closer to the war.  Edith's marriage has failed and she once again moves into a close relationship with Ambrose, her 'nancy-boy'..Frank Moorhouse's intensive research into the history of this period has resulted in a fascinating insight into the influential characters in the League, the reasons for it's failure and the impact of the rise of Nazi Germany on the bohemian and artistic population of Geneva.The story concludes on a despondent note with the failure of the surviving delegates of the League to be admitted to the conference in San Fransisco of the newly formed United Nations, and their feeling that their work was to no avail .
It is quite pretty and my sister loved the ruffles. However the material is scratchy on the inside and the ruffles get rather flattened and crumpled during shipping. Also I'd say it needs thicker straps considering the dress isn't that light .
It's pretty amazing considering this is the first laptop I have bought in five years. The startup is quick and smooth, the keyboard has large font and a non-slippery feel which is lovely, the touchpad responses well enough no sensitivity issues. I'm amazed by how quickly the programs open up and how efficient it moves from one program to the next.The weight isn't very heavy, its compact, the battery is easily removable and having a CD/DVD drive is a plus. Of course Windows 7 has an excellent interface I'm familiar with and its very user-friendly. Overall its a great product, I've had no problems after the first couple of days and the shipping was fast and the laptop was in mint condition no flaws as far as I could tell. Also the speakers are better than I was expecting it, it can get pretty loud and the screen is perfect for watching movies, great resolution.One of the best selling points about Toshiba is their extra applications such as the PC Health Monitor, which was a lifesaver on my last laptop it tells you basic info about the CPU temperature, fan speed, battery life status which is a simple way of monitoring the over health of your laptop and tracking its decline.I would say this laptop is best if you are looking for a device to keep up with your internet browsing, watching movies and listening to music and doing moderate use of applications such as MS Office etc. Excellent choice for a student .
Did not think I needed a griddle, now I use it all the time. Removable handles are useful for storage. Watch out for eggs sliding off into the sink, has a slick surface .
Now I can sit in the back yard and read while I cook. Plus, not limited to one timer. So easy to use .
this thing broke in a week the tubes inside shattered and the skull came off. DO NOT BUY IT, Not worth the money .
The poker games are fun but very addictive game  that is very tough to beat the computer on any hand you win and try to double your small prize  ..... it will beat you 19 times out of 20 and you will lose all you just worked so hard to gain.  Very low on my list to keep you wanting to return for more ....... come on guys , these are only points ..... not money .
nice for the price will recomend if startind a low budget music system not bad at all if you want to hear your music clearly i really enjoy this product .
i still waiting for my stuff!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i hope come late if not i want my money back!!! always late i am tired .
I got this book for free fortunately because the first recipe I'm trying doesn't fit in the recommended jar size!  I've not even filled the jar 1/16! The book says just to add nuts, fruit, or chocolate chips to fill up the jar, but it's CHILI!!! So frustrated .
I like this product.  When the doctor said that it has to dissolve in your mouth, I was very leery.  I do not like things dissolving in my mouth but I got it.  I was very surprised.  It did not have a strong taste and did not taste bad at all.  My doctor did specify the 'Jarrow Formula' .
The product itself is good. The capsules are well made.  My doctor asked me to get it. This is the 2nd month that I have been taking it.  I don't see a difference in how I feel but the doctor said to give it another month .
My husband likes this product and has used it off and on for 30 years. He says that it is the only thing that makes his hair lay down without feeling greasy or stiff. He ran out recently (a little goes a long way) and we could not find it locally. So off to the internet we go.  After searching, we decided to buy it from Amazon .
i used it only one time and it doesn't work any more. i used it properly with care but it .
after two months i still use this one. No problems it charges my batterry fast. my notebook is happy and full .
i try to connect following devices to my old projector from 2008it works with my Time warner boxdoes not work with my PS3does not work with my apple tvwith my mac book pro video is working but no sound .
Just what i needed!I went to Best Buy and there was nothing like this under $300.So i find this as a great deal and plus it fits exactly as i imagined.Very easy to install too .
i really did not want to spend a lot of money for mobile speaker.i love this speaker. the sound is not the same when using Bluetooth. At home i always connect him on my audio cable to my device .
This game is O.K. starting out but after you complete all single player missions (about a week's worth of frequent play) you run out of game play. At level 50 you have completed all missions and there are no more. To build a really BIG card takes about 1 million coins, and without any world's to play the only way to get coins is the market. Even so it's fun if you like in depth card development. There is literally an infinite combination of builds.  Doesn't play so well on I-pad 1. Overall fun game, I'm still playing about 4 hours a week after 3 months. And you don't have to spend real money to build really strong cards, just a lot of time. 4 stars. And developers, please open up new worlds, or add harder difficulty to existing ones please .
Haven't used it yet, but the last one lasted about 4 months.  My parents leave the TV on all the time. Does that effect the warrenty time .
I like the &#34;wake up&#34; factor of this blend.  I could drink it all day long and never get tired of it .
I am pleased with the brew, but not enthused.  I have had better for the price, but its ok. Thats it .
It is an ok tea,not the best or worst.  It seems a lil weak if you ask me.  I wish it had a stronger taste .
Its ok, not much of a choc kinda freak. Not my cup of tea really.  Might be asking the wrong person .
I choose this rating because this phone has met  my expectation.  I like that it is easy and very friendly to users like me who are not so much into technology.  I am able to use most of the applications such as whatsup, viber, magic jack and so forth.  I can recommend to anyone that is into smart phone .

workes great very easy to set up,there is nothing to dislike about it,yes i would recommend this to a friend .
Fits in my alumi-wallet and has ok tools in case. But wouldn't rely on it for serious emergencies. Fun gift but just a trinket .
You need to have done alot of 3d wood puzzles to even begin to handle this. It has no instruction only the number guide and 705 pieces. It took me a month of sanding, fitting, painting, and glueing a little everyday between everyday life. Looks awesome and it is big. Now I have nowhere to display because it's so big but it is the best 3d puzzle i have done. If you love the wood puzzlesand have the time give this a shoot. Worth the .
I have 23 combination wrenches and thought I couldn't find a roll up big enough. This came fairly quick and this fits my tools with room to spare for sockets and screwdrivers. Great quality and the carrying handle and the lock clips are even better. Good buy. I recommend .
Comes with no instructions so not for a newbie. Took  some time since i painted all the details. Looks okay. Not as great as  the St. Petersburg church puzzle .
I could not find this cake topper any where. It was just what I wanted for my daughters birthday. She loved it and actually still plays with it .
Good dvd that shows in the life of a 40 year old Elton. Not about music really just life on the Made in England tour. Decent if you're a fan .
I really liked the neckalce, but you could not read the writing on the heart. I had to find a magnifying glass on christmas just to read it to my mom. Other than that it was a nice .
I was forced to pay for two day shipping and was promised to get it before Christmas and i didn't get until after Christmas so I was forced to look like a jerk with no gift. And they are cheaply made. Memory Foam? More like forgetful foam .
Belly Ring Dangle Navel Ring with CZ Stones 14G Belly Piercing 1.6mm Belly Ring Heart Spiral with Surgical Steel Bar 14 Gauge 7/16" + 1 Free Belly Retainer - Choose your colorDaughter put it on and within one hour lost the stones out. I know the stones were not real but still disappointing. She did not even get to wear it all day. I would not buy this product again .
I bought as a gift and husband wears everyday and sprays several squirts and it doesn't smell like other colognes. Doesn't stick and almost a waste .
This is mildy enteraining. It has super short webisodes that don't really connect. Waiting for season 2 to start so i can continue the show. It's just ok. Not that great .
It is hard for me to write a review about this product since i never got it. The company that sold it to me took my money but never sent me a sticker so now I'm out of a sticker that looked cool but i will never know. Don't trust customdecaltattooz.Update: It has been over a month and still nothing from this company .
The wood is warped and makes the whole clock not fit right. It has to be sanded and shaped before it can be put together. Cheap balse wood and not worth the price .
This runs with the meep which is the worst tablet ever built. This microphone isn't even needed because the meep has a tiny pin hole microphone on it and can hear you say the commands. Dust collector .
I paid way more than i should of for uncirculated coins but i wanted them. Well when I got them they were all in a single plastic bag and they all had knicks and scratches. Worth only as pocket change. Never again!!!!! Liars .
So in the picture i saw a nice size detailed metal puzzle. Eager to try since I enjoy 3d wood puzzles, i ordered it. Well to my disappointment I got in the mail a small square about 4 inches around. And to add more disappointment when I built it it was smaller than the palm of my hand. For the price it should of been much much larger. Don't be fooled. It's only worth $5.00.Update 4/15/2013I have bought and completed 13 of these MODELS from A.C. Moore for $5.99 a piece, so i stand by my comment that thiss one is overpriced. It was still fun to build just like all the others from the maker of this brand.Just be warned, They are small .
It is nicely built and not to large. Works like any other wallet but nice picture. Might not last for long long time thou .
I can't wait to read the next book about the Anderson family they ate men who love hard and strong .
I choose this book of the cover but once I started reading I couldn't put it down it turned out to be a true love story the best love was that of family .
this book was a page tuner didn't expect this ending I can't wait to read about the stories to come about the Barboza brothers and the women they love. Makes us full figured women feel good knowing there are men out there who desire us .
loving this game can't wait to unlock more rooms i didnt think it would be so much fun i would recomend it to friends keep up the good worka .
I haven't had a cerwin vega since the 80's. I read these reviews and took a chance. There isnt many reviews out there so i feel obligated to share. Im a klipsch fan and the xls compare very well. I have the xls 6c and the xls 28's. The 6c was great and brought alot to the over all sound of my system. Very clean and dynamic. Dont wait! High end speakers is what this is for a great price. Not the smallest thing sitting under your flat screen, but well worth it. Im a CV fan once again .
I just received this case in the mail today. I ordered it monday and got it by Thursday and it had to ship from california to maine. The feeling of the case is very sturdy. It is a well build case and feels great in the hand. This case is great if you looking to prevent your phone from scratches and are looking for a stylish case but with minimal protect to show off the beauty of your iphone. The back of the case is see through so you can see the apple logo. It is not white on the back as the picture shows. The devise when faced downwards on a smooth surface does not touch the surface but it would be a good idea to get a screen protector as there is very little room from the case to the screen. The only reason i gave it 4/5 is because i feel the case is a little over priced and the picture does show a white backing. I purchased it for $15 dollars when i feel it should have been more like $10 but still definitely worth the money. I would highly recommend this case to anyone looking for a good case with minimal protection .
For around $10 you can't go wrong with this case. The case has a nice feel to it. It does not feel cheap and is nice and grippy. The case has some soft stuff inside of it. This grips the phone really nicely and protects from scratches on the inside. The screen protector i was using at the time did not fit with this case so i did have to remove it. The reason i gave it 4/5 is because the cutout for the camera is a little large. Also the lock button is a little hard to access with this case. Other than that the cutouts for the buttons are perfect .
I love my new headset! I can wear it while exercising, washing dishes, doing my housework: and I don't have to worry about it falling out of my ears!!! I LOVE IT .
No!!!! I was very dissatisfied with the case.. When I opened the package the bow fell completely off&#128547;&#128547;&#128547; So therefor I had to return it... I will NEVER order another one .
Works great for the small room we wanted to move some air around,  Directions are simple, Not sure why several complain about putting it together .
This watch was good for maybe 2 weeks before the color drastically changed into another color I've never seen! Cheap .
The case was only good for 2 days after a minor fall off the couch! Next, i know the case is chipped and Broken! Not acceptable! I was not happy at all .
This is EXACTLY what I have been searching for for my Vita! I wanted something not so bulky but would protect from the items in my purse or bag. Will not protect against falls but they make cases for that. Love it .
I was a little disappointed in the quality of this tulle. I'm using it to make a 38 inch bustle on a tutu and it frayed on the ends and curled and got very weird looking. It does not match the straightness of the red tulle I have on the tutu so I'm going to have to go back, throw all the black tulle away, and buy a better quality tulle. Not happy at all, since I paid about $18 total for this material and I'm just having to throw it away and redo all my work. What a waste of my money .
I loved this case, it just looks nice and clean and well put together. It's not bulky and keeps your phone nice and thin, not slippery. Cut out openings are very precise, didn't have any trouble getting my S-pen out or using the camera. I was so heartbroken when I had to give it away, though. I have a Zagg screen protector on my Note II and after having this case on my phone for about 30 minutes my Zagg started lifting and bubbling on one corner. The inside of the case is a little too sharp to have a screen protector. I still blame the Zagg though, I feel it doesn't sit well on the screen (it extends to the edges too much). I really loved this case but, because the Zagg was a $30 purchase, I had to go with another case. If you don't have a screen protector that doesn't extend too far to the edges of your screen then you should be fine. I'm just sad I couldn't use it .
EXTREMELY sheer. If you are looking for some sort of shield against sunlight this is not the curtain for you. It matched perfectly with what I was going for in my bedroom. Not the best material, it was a little frayed on some spots but nothing terribly noticeable .
Item is what was expected. Arrived in good condition, minor loose threads, nothing major. Will go great with my costume .
when i recieved the cover it was a lite pink not hot.pink and it had.some of the white rubbed off .
I didn't think I was going to like it as much as I do even my husband loves it and its a perfect size .
After you charge it it doesn't keep its charged for that long. Plus it barely charges my phone gets the battery to like 20 .
I ordered this and a got some Chinese finger puppet thing I would recommend getting one from the store and it is cheaper because you don't have to pay shipping .
I LOVED this book. Not one very easy to put down and finish later. Kept me drawn in until the end. And, WOW, what an ending. I can't wait for more from this VERY talented author. This is a "must read .
I got this item as a gift for my mom and she loved it!! It shipped super fast and when I received it in the mail I had a surprise! it was buy one get one free and I didn't even know it! My mom loves this item so much! definitely a must get for moms everywhere .
This book is terrifying and captivating and brilliant. I could not put it down. It made me hateful and angry and opened my eyes in a way that I cannot come back from. My entire understanding of myself and the world changed with this read. It is not for the faint of heart. If you are a feminist or believe in women or at the very least have any concept of human decency this will affect you. It affected me. I finished the book, looked up, and whole heartedly felt baffled by the fact that the world around me had not changed when I had changed so much. I highly recommend. It is a very unique look at very heavy subject matter .
I have read almost all of the kontra's menagerie series and this is by far one of my favorites. However I am a sucker for a strong dominant personality. I this case it's not the shifter .
This book is one of my least favorites in this series so far. I love that it continues to fallow the other couples as there stories continue to unfold, however I felt as though this book was to short. There is getting to be detail after detail in the story lines of the numerous couples that needs to be told, i felt as tho grit and his masters story didn't get the details it deserves. I am not sure if that was due to moving things along or trying to shorten thing so the book didn't get to long ? I personal would have preferred the extra pages and details. I was just getting into grit and his master's story when this book came to an end, I am ready for stix to release to see what happens next .
I wasn't expecting much when I ordered this ring.  My only expectation is that it won't turn my finger green.  I think it's safe to say I got a lot more than what I expected.  The ring is heavy for it's size but to me that speaks of the quality of the material.  The matte finish is really nice and I've yet to scratch it after about a week of wearing it.  The smooth shiny sections are a great compliment to the matte finish.  For this price, it's a steal and you cannot find a better ring for the same price.  I highly recommend this ring to anyone looking for something that not your traditional wedding band.  You will love it .
The fit is really good but it does come with extra ear pieces just in case you should need a different size. The sound is really good and the bass is surprisingly good as well.  For the price it's hard to beat.  These in ear headphones actually compare reasonably well to some over ear headphones.  For the price I was actually expecting a weak bass sound but these are really good.  I've had these for a while now and they're still kicking and sounding great.  I would highly recommend these to anyone looking for some incredible headphones but don't want to pay over $100.  These are just as good as some of the $100+ headphones.  You won't regret it .
The rotors are even and balanced well.  They perform well and so far I have no issues with these.  I know people spend a lot of money for brake rotors if you're going to spend money on your brake system, spend it on some high quality brake pads.  These rotors get the job done and they don't need all the fancy bells and whistle to do it.  The price is great and really hard to beat.  They came packaged as they should, in a box and wrapped in plastic.  When they leave the factory, they put an anti-rust treatment on the rotors so it's recommended you clean that off before installation with some brake cleaning fluid.  I installed them and my brakes have been much improved.  I would recommend these to anyone who needs new brake rotors .
I'm was initially hesitant to make this purchase but after reading some of the reviews, I went ahead and made the purchase.  I'm really glad I did.  This ring is solid and is surprisingly heavy for it's size.  To me that speaks of quality material and so far it's been exactly that.  It's beautiful and has a smooth shiny finish that seems to hold up well to everyday wear and doesn't seem to scratch easy.  The ring is true to size and fits me perfectly as a size 7 should.  I don't know why you would pay $100+ for a nice simple ring like this when you can have this for a fraction of that.  This is well worth the money, don't hesitate and buy it now .
Product is as described and fits properly.  Just make sure you take the time to look at the size chart so you get the correct size.  There are no pockets for your hands as you might expect on a Levis denim jacket.  But for the price, the denim jacket looks good and quality seems to be decent as well.  I would recommend this if you can do without pockets for your hands.  The 2 chest pockets are real pockets however.  For this price, it's a good purchase .
I bought this for my wife so she can wear it around without fear of losing her wedding ring and she loves it!  It's quite heavy for it's size and to me, that speaks of it's quality.  So far it's proven to be of quality material and craftsmanship, as it's resistant to scratches  and the finish is amazing.  Some people pay several hundred dollars for a simple band like this and I'm not sure why.  You can get this for a fraction of that and still have the quality people associate with the higher price rings.  Don't be afraid to make this purchase if you need a band or just another ring to wear in place of a wedding ring.  It's great quality and for this price, you cannot get anything better.  I would recommend this to anyone .
This screen protector is great!  The protector is slick and it doesn't change the way your screen feels after you've applied the screen protector.  I'm not a fan of the matte, non glare screen protector because it takes away from the slick feel of the glass.  I can deal with the glare if the screen protector feels like the glass, and it does.  I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a screen protector and isn't looking for the non glare protectors.  You can't beat this product for the price .
This amp is amazing and for that price, it just doesn't seem right.  But it is and the amp is great.  I'm pairing the amp with an Alpine 1043d sub and this thing makes the sub sound incredible.  I don't even have the gain turned up on the amp, I'm just using the EQ settings on my head unit and it sounds amazing.  If I wanted to, I could turn up the gain and rattle some windows, I'm more concerned about quality bass sound and this amp gives me that.  I've yet to have any issues with the amp as it doesn't get too hot even after pushing it.  This thing can handle it.  Highly recommended to anyone looking for an amp .
I like this case it is not expensive and it is so cool. My friends at school told me it was so cool .
This book had me on my toes the entire time.. I couldn't stop reading it! River was just a dream, his songs, his everything is just wow... He was so sweet and understanding with Dahlia. This book is a MUST READ. I cried, I laughed, I smiled.. That cliff hanger left me wanting more so I went and got Torn right away. Thank You Kim .
I'M STILL KIND OF IN SHOCK.Let me start off my saying this is not your typical story, it isn't a fairytale. I was a bit ify about this read at first, I'm not going to lie. BUT that quickly changed! I was sucked into Lilian's life, her thoughts, her struggles, her good times, her bad times, and all of her choices. Her story was so real, and so raw, and I loved every bit of it. It was like I was with her the whole time! When it came to her relationships I was in love with Leo, I loved them together. But I also loved Nick. It's a tough choice but Leo has my heart. He was there for her, he saved her. He is Lilian's happily ending. I was really rooting for Nick and Lil to work, I was kind of jealous she scored a man like that! But everything happens for a reason, and somehow someway Leo and Lil ended up together again after 20 years.Everything that Lil went through hurt my heart, so many highs and lows had me turning the page and turning the page. It was an emotional rollercoaster. Life was good to Lil then it was cruel. They always say you should let these bad times make you stronger but that's not always the case. Sometimes life can hit you time after time and you start to become weak. She dealed with a lot, I felt for her. I sometimes wanted to take some of her pain away.Overall this book was simply great. I was left speechless, I won't be able to pick up another book for a while. It was a rollercoaster of emotions, of pain, happiness and everything in between. It's gritty and so real. This is Lil's story and I know there will be a book 2 with Leo's POV. I would reccemond this read to those who love a good ugly ugly emotional cry .
I really loved reading this! It's a great girl meets boy novel full of lust, and moments of sadness. Madison met Liam and they were immediately attracted to each other and they later on find out that they work with each other! I got to hand it to Christina this was a very well written debut book, if there was any spelling or grammar errors I never caught them because I was too caught up in the book!Two people trying to make something of themselves In the medical field, and they find each other and know things will no longer be the same, they want a no strings attached relationship but that wasn't happening! I was on the verge of tears when Liam left, I was also so mad! He frustrated me at times! I really felt for Maddie. And i also wanted to kill Owen for doing what he did.Overall this was a great debut read and I am REALLY looking forward to seeing what's next for this great author .
I didn't think this series could get anymore amazing and any more heart wrenching but as always R.K Lilley NEVER fails to make me cry, laugh, scream and say &#34;oh my god!&#34; So many times. The relationship between Danika and Tristen in nothing short of steamy and a hot mess. He's a jealous maniac with the sex drive of a 16 year old boy. And it's hot!Danika's patience was tested as was Tristens. Danika had to deal with groupies from her mans past and Tristen had a hard time staying out of jail and trouble because his girlfriend is attractive and everything pisses him off. Tristen has been through a lot with the situation of his brother and now all his mother does is blame him. Some happy moments occur but are quickly shut down. These are the parts that killed me. I was rooting for them to fix the broken pieces but not everything can be mended.The story took so many different turns and now I have whip lash! I cried and yelled and I was shocked. THIS book.. This WHOLE series is just amazing. AMAZING .
This was seriously the most perfect conclusion to the Trust Me Trilogy! It was just how I pictured it would be. I'm kind of a sucker for sweet stories like this but it wasn't all that sweet thanks to Alistair. There were plenty of times when I wanted to punch that old man in the throat. Aiden at times was so passive. I felt like he just let the insults slide one too many times. But after all that is his father and they love each other no matter what. At times I wanted to shake Jenny and make her realize that Alistair didn't have power over her. Once she got into her story with Jason I understood it all. She was out through way too much. It's a lot to handle for one person.Callie and mike made me super happy by the way! Overall this was a great conclusion to this trilogy. It's romantic yet frustrating at times. Book 1 and 2 must be read before this one. Amazing job Miss Osborn I can't wait for more to come from you .
I recieved these items and they are not acceptable, they are so dirty, that I am not comfortable giving them to the kids, it will take to long to try and clean them. Not happy at all .
These are indeed the best lights I ever owned. no tangling or muss love the case they come in for storage as well. Just wish there were multi color lights in this length as well. I am replacing on my old lights with these rope lights I use mine when camping but since we don't camp much in winter I am using them at christmas as well to decorate my porch. you can't loose with this purchase .
it  is a great game and it shows alot of stuff the others didn't and it is great to play .
was a big joke not all the stuff was there and it is junk.  do not  waste your money on it .
I had went and got my hair done at the beauty salon and they use this product in my hair and it was so beautiful I couldn't believe how silky and long looking my hair was it was a great feeling try it and this oil will leave your hair feeling so good and silky you would always want to put in hair no lies this is not a scam just try it and buy it .
Looks and feels real. not as long as shown in the photo but still looks great! Very soft too which is a major plus .
WE HAVE HAD CORELLE DISHES IN THE PAST BUT WENT TO OTHER STYLES JUST FOR A CHANGE.  WE HAVE REMODELED THE KITCHEN AND BOUGHT NEW DISHES AND MY WIFE LIKED THE SQUARE AND THE LIGHTNESS OF CORELLE.  WE HAVE BEEN USING THEM AND JUST LOVE THEM.  THEY ARE VERY GOOD LOOKING, DURABLE AND JUST NICE TO EAT OFF OF.  THE MUGS HAVE A NICE HANDLE TO HOLD ONTO.  I WAS HESITANT TO BUY BUT THE WIFE WANTED THEM SO WE HAVE THEM.  ONCE I STARTED USING THEM I REALLY LOVE THEM.  THE SHIPMENT CAME ALL SECURE WITH NO PROBLEMS .
Book was fantastic, I had real trouble not reading it during work! I loved all the characters and became very emotionally invested in the storyline. So well written! 5 stars :- .
This case is very thin and adds no bulk to your nexus 4, it does a good job raising the sides of the case so the screen doesn't touch the floor flat.One thing I wish they would add is the top and bottom of the case. If the case covered all around the nexus that would add protection which I would definetly buyvagain if improved .
I was used and I don't need to charge until the 4 days, very usefull, I will recommend this item .
i bought this in 2012 for 249.99 and i bought a 42' vizio a samsung blu-ray and 5.1 pyle swivel speakers, had no problems what so ever, sounds great on every setting, very loud can stand high volume at long periods of time, you just have to know how to hook it up right and hook the speaker wires rite and you will not have any problems, this one of the best receivers i have owned in 45 yrs...5 star .
i bought this blk berry had no user manuak, so i did'nt know what i was dealing with, no wi-fi poor reception poor plans- over make this short it's a brady buch style phone .
i bought this watch at d j h gate a month ago, i took the leather band off bought a omega steel band took for ever to put on, when i finally got it on i noticed were its round at top of band the watch got alittle scratched up putting in on a couple days latter i noticed were the scratches were on the watch was a gold color.BRASS! i plus there are no engravings on the back, like the watch here shown does, hmmm a conterfit??? can anyone help me solve this?? thanks .
Author had knowledge of New York City, antiques, people of privilege, and especially drugs.  There were brilliant descriptions and heartfelt emotions.  There was too much truth in the book -- the unrequited love and life is short imparts a feeling of hopelessness.  The fact that art endures seems to be the whole point of writing the book.  If you have nothing important to do, read it.  I found it to be a sad story with a sad ending and far too many words .
Not the right one .
I am glad to have purchased this item.  The screen protector is so clear I still do not believe that it's on the screen of the phone.  The is an excellent product I'm even able to effectively use my touch screen with wet fingertips .
Loved this blouse! Dressier than I thought it would be, very nice quality,and great price. My daughter thought it was comfortable which usually isn't so unless it's a tee .

I liked the bravery and forward thinking survivalist young people.  No whining, just getting the job done.  I hope and pray there are tons of young adults out there who would take good skills and attitudes into their lives like these did .
Compared to the original pens I had many years ago when the pens and black paper first came out, these pens are not as bright nor as opaque.  The original ones were much more opaque and the colors were brighter with a lot more contrast .
After I got the Fuse I read that I could use the best of all the other companies products by purchasing this adapter set.  I couldn't wait!!  It's true... I got some other very complicated cut outs and the Fuse cut them beautifully!  If you're thinking about getting a machine, I recommend the Fuse, it's great .
I love the product, I was new to scrapbooking so I had no idea how expensive it would get to be just to get the basic sets.  However, I love that I can use many other company's products on it with the adapter set.  I found many many videos on the web for other companies products and how to use them but few on the fuse.  It's pretty simple to use however.  I'm handicapped so the weight tends to be a problem (IT&#34;S VERY VERY HEAVY!!!) but am working around it.  Several of the presses (butterfly, leaf, oval, etc.) are truly beautiful.  I'd sure recommend it, seems like each company has things to recommend theirs, but Fuse will give you the ability to use all their best stuff too so, how could you go wrong .

For the longest time I was beyond words after I started reading this book.It's taken me a few weeks to recompose my senses enough to write this review! But unlike many of the other 1-star reviews, I'm not going to discourage people from picking up this book.Actually, I ENCOURAGE it, so you can see for yourself just how absurd its premises are.  But instead of handing over your $$ to line Amanda Byrne's pocketbook, seriously, please instead check this book out from a library/borrow a copy from a friend/find free passages online.I don't know what is more disturbing... the actual content of the book or the fact that it was even green-lighted to begin with. And Oprah!  Dear beloved Oprah!  How COULD you endorse a book that teaches "If you see people who are overweight do no observe them but immediately switch your mind to the picture of you in your perfect body and feel it."Selling  this to the masses has just as many frightening implications as  "If you see people who are Jewish do not observe them but immediately switch your mind to the picture of you in your perfect race and feel it"  (And we all know that the mental "snuffing" of Jews didn't just end there....)If you think, "Well, that's an exaggerated comparison.  Rhonda Byrne is not implying the genocide of fat people" well think again.  Rhonda Byrne may not be advocating physical genocide but she certainly is advocating the mental kind, encouraging her readers to embrace the US vs THEM mentality...  "Us" being the superior, the thinner, the richer (the "straight", etc) and "them" being anyone who is not "us".A person who finds their identity through such a skewed mentality can become so desensitized to "them" that violence against "them" often can and does erupt, whether it is the murder of one..... or 6 million.And to think, regarding ""events in history where masses of lives were lost,"  The Secret has the audacity to say, ""By the law of attraction, they had to be on the same frequency as the event."  So, according to the "law" of attraction, they basically wished and thought it upon themselves until it became true?!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!(The exclamation points are  a polite summary  of what I was REALLY thinking... I have to keep my review G-rated, you know)Amanda Byrne must have never read Holocaust survivor Elie Wisel's book "Night".  Or if she has, she probably did not "observe" any of Wisel's horrific written  accounts, and rather envisioned her own "perfect"  book and the millions of dollars she would rake in!!!Ahem. Moving on....A quote at the beginning of the same paragraph about weight reads: ""Make it your intention to look for, admire, and inwardly praise people with your idea of perfect-weight bodies."Is it any wonder, then, that people (mainly women and young girls) end up obsessing over their own bodies and develop eating disorders?Another paragraph from this book which just rubbed me raw was:"Whether we realize it or not, we are thinking most of the time. If you are speaking or listening to someone, you are thinking. If you are reading the newspaper or watching television, you are thinking. When you recall memories from your past, you are thinking. When you are considering something in your future, you are thinking. When you are driving, you are thinking. When you are getting ready in the morning, you are thinking."Gee, I'm not sure I get the point.  Do you think she's trying to tell me that I am thinking?I can't even begin to tell you how completely turned off I was when I read this:"Everything that surrounds you right now in your life, including the things you're complaining about, you've attracted. Now I know at first blush that's going to be something that you hate to hear.... And I'm here to be a little bit in your face and to say, yes you did attract it"I'm sorry... even if the "law" you are speaking of (on authority, of course) really is 100% fact, if you feel you have to "get in my face" to make me believe it, well, then you're insulting my intelligence.  Real experts in real sciences don't HAVE  to get in anybody's face to convince them of anything.  (I've never heard of physicists/scientists/academic professors having to get  in people's faces to prove the law of gravity.)And besides, no matter what point someone is trying to make, whether it be about this so-called law or about something as ordinary as an opinion of a new song out on the radio, if it is expressed along with an "in-your-face" attitude, I'm not going to take to the message - even if I happen to agree with it - very kindly.The problem with "The Secret" is that the quotes I referenced above are not the only disturbing / damaging / insulting ones to be found.  The book is FULL of them.  Don't believe me?  Read the book to find out for yourself.In conclusion, the only explanations I can come up with for the baffling number of 5-star reviews for "The Secret" are:1. Real people are writing about their real experiences with positive thinking, but mistakenly attribute  the positive things happening in their lives  to having read and espoused "The Secret" - as opposed to the fact that they actually worked hard for what they got, or they just had plain dumb luck.2. Reviewers actually wrote a negative review,  but didn't realize they accidentally selected 5 stars (if you read the 5-star reviews, you'll see what I'm talking about)3. Shameless investors / promoters of this book have inflated the number of 5-star reviews to pump up salesP.S.  Oprah I love you and I truly believe you the light for so many people.  I hope to see you one day stand up to "The Secret"!!  Even if it means having to backtrack your endorsement.  You did it with James Frey, so you can do it with Amanda Byrne .
Love Thomas....don't like being woke at 2:40 am to write a review for a movie...Really!  Can you not ask this in the middle of the fay .
only real con i can think of would be it not having removable/replaceable metal shield things on the back where your video card is placed .
It was very easy to assemble, it took me a minute or two. I don't know why other people had problems. Once put together it is sturdy and very fun to use. Happy with purchase .
Best christmas gift ever!! I swim every morning for 1 hour Mon- Fri at the gym and I don't think I can do it without music!! So far it's been working perfectly, no problems at all. Great customer service too .
The book came to my door and packaging was crisp or whatever. Book was solid and I could tell it was new, but the covers were not parallel to each other and the binding was bent. I'm a stickler for small things. The fix was easy but if the book were available in a store near me, I would've purchased it there .
I am very glad I read this book recommend it to anyone else who have not read it.Very entertaining read .
AWFUL. They are totally washed and clearly a lot of these reviews are fake, and i would never buy again for PST. What a waste .
This magnifier is excellent for situations in which my hands are occupied with a squirming bird wearing a band I can't quite read!! Thanks for the light, too...it really helps!Best .
I do not like is not my thing. So you see expect otherwise.Before I had moved more topics.Also has a great you .
This microwave is smaller than our previous 1100 watt and that is a plus because the inside room is still more than adequate. I don't mind that the light doesn't come on until it's cooking even though that was a negative for some purchasers. I don't think it's any louder than our other one...now I'm waiting to see if it's going to last LONGER than the old one! I certainly hope so...my very first microwave was a very large Sharp Carousel that we used for over 20 years! The second Sharp Carousel lasted only 5 years! I certainly hope the Panasonic does better than that! So far...so good!I forgot to say why the four star rating...it's because the ease of programming certain foods is not as easy as it was with our previous microwave. I am very much computer/programming literate but this one seems to be a little more unnecessarily complicated...just sayin' .
So far...so good with this new Melitta coffeemaker. I've used it every day since it arrived. I looked and researched all types and makes and finally decided to get this one based on the previous reviews and past experience with Melitta products. In the past my luck with new coffeemakers has not been very good so I was really reluctant to even buy another one. Hopefully this machine will continue to be a solid purchase .
We haven't had the phones too long but at this time there have been no problems. They are easy to read and easy to program. The clear reception is excellent. We live in an area that seems to be a landlocked &#34;Bermuda Triangle&#34; when it comes to telephone, cell phone and internet reception. So far these phones have performed very well .
Been using it for 3 weeks and while I can't really tell if it looks thicker, my family and friends commented on it without me ever bringing up my hair.As for the smell, it only smells right after the shower and no one has ever brought it up .
This is the second time I have bought these and both times I love them for a few months.The problem is, after a few months the grip begins to separate from its holder and leaves you with the grip falling off. Stronger glue is needed. I will not be buying a third time .
Does what it claims and does help in games like call of duty. Installation can be tricky if you've never taken apart a controller before. I also like the fact you can remove the screw so the trigger can be fully depressed for those games that require it .
This was the first novel I read by Jason Gehlert. As with any first time author I read, I am always skeptical of what I am diving in to but do so with an open mind. From the start, Jeremiah captured my attention with a pretty intriguing story line. It is hard to find originality (in my opinion) in a genre such as this but Jason has found gold with this storyline. Making a deal with the Devil sounds like an exotic idea, but the inner demons that are faced as a result of what must be carried out can weigh heavily on a person. I didn't know whether to hate or to love main character Jeremiah Black, and that was the beauty of this book. As the story moves on, you think you know what is coming next and then you are taken in a completely unexpected turn that leads to another great subplot. Just a fun, good paced read that has some pretty interesting twists with each turn of the page. As a first time reader of this author, I cannot wait to see what comes next from this amazing talent .
This book has it all - drama, comedy and an emotional roller coaster ride. Now take into consideration that all of that alone falls into one character throughout the book, and you can only imagine what transpires with everyone else involved in the story. Living The Dream follows Kurt on an escapade that he devises as the perfect plan, which backfires on him from the start. It's a non-stop, action-packed adventure that will having you wanting to turn the pages faster than you can read them. From the very first page you will understand why you love and hate Kurt at the same time, rooting for him on one page and wanting him to get his just desserts on the next, and why no matter what you think of him you will always want more of this loveable loser. If you are looking for a great action novel that will keep you guessing until the very end (I know I did), then Living The Dream is the one book that you must have in your collection..................and oh yea Tim's other books only get better (as hard as it was to top this one .
All in all, it was a very good read. It started out as just another &#34;how to&#34; guide, but it very quickly turned into an informative wheelhouse and I was able to set up a few new methods of promoting myself as I read it. I have read a few similar books and they all say the same thing - which isn't much - but Seumas definitely helped me to get a few more platforms going that I wouldn't otherwise have thought about. If you're looking for some good pointers and a guiding hand through the process, this is the book for you .
waoooh...this book enligthened my life...!I'm...different! Nothing is the same since our first meeting, and I used to go through it daily ...as kind reminder for my self.I red the monk too.... seems like I &#34;slept&#34; during 25 years .
like reviewers said...armhole is not &#34;the best fit&#34;. But i love the length, love the color and the clothe is soft...i recommend it if you don't care much about your underwear showing a bit .
please forget the color you saw...! nothing like that.fortunately I ordered one size up. So no complain with toe box.heels are wonderful and love the footbed too.looks weird (11M) but guess that I'll love it more later .
Went for 34FF wear it as racerback is better for me than the normal way. more tight and help girls to not bounce as much .
Ok I really love the shoes and I'm a bit surprise as I red that indigo line run small.true to size but there is something with the toe box that I can't define..And no kiddin' I think it will be beautiful on small feet. Not mine (10M)...It looks weird.I'm so sad coz' I heeeart the design .
These are my first running shoes, and love them soooo much. I just ordered another one in periwinkle/sun color. My feet are a bit wide, and feared that the (B) size won't fit, but I have enough room.I also bought the nimbus 14 but didn't give them a try yet, but love the fit .
I just received it and ...no comment! definitely in love!true to size, and the platform make it perfect!gonna wear it with short dresses and trousers .
it's beautiful! but it runs small a bit. half size up will be a better choice.unfortunately I cannot send it back. but really love the look .
I haven't had many problems with it, occasionally I catch some static. But overall it's pretty good for how cheap it is .
Overall this is a really good eyeliner that is a lot easier to apply than many others I have had in the past. It won't smudge and lasts a long time .
I purchased this as a Christmas present for my father over the holidays. He had a it about 2 to 3 weeks and it quit working. The screen became discolored and then it crapped out. I emailed the seller to see if I can return it and I heard nothing back. I emailed him in January. I still have the tablet sitting in a drawer. I do not recommend this product. I would really prefer my money back to be honest. Hope this helps you all .
For the price I paid you really can't beat it. They are comfy and are not cheap at all. I would purchase again .
I brought two bottles of this product 3 weeks ago, one for myself the other for my husband.  We are not what you would consider overweight, but we both wanted to shed a few extra pounds to see a more pronounced definition from our five days a week exercise work outs.  This product really works.  I am a pre diabetic, so not only did I lose 4 pounds, it also lowered my blood sugar.  My husband lost 9 pounds, and at the age of 50 he can once again see his six pack.  I spoke to the customer service rep and she said that they are coming out with a better new and improved product, I will be looking forward to trying that product also, and I hope it works as well as this one.  I will keep a bottle in my cabinet in case the weight starts trying to creep back on.  10 pounds is the max I will allow my body to go over in weight and for a 50 year old woman, this product will help me maintain my 123 pounds for my 5"4 frame .
I received the phone case on time as expected. Although I was somewhat upset that 5 of the crystals had already fallen out. I suspect this is either from poor handling while shipping, or poor gluing from the company. The color of the case is wonderful and all my friends ask where I bought it. I love the leopard design and fur texture, but really wish the crystals weren't falling out so quickly. Recommended for young to teenage girls for any event .
I received this in the mail on time as stated in absolute excellent condition. It fits my boyfriends 3GS perfectly with no odd pieces sticking out or sharp edges. The camo is exactly like the picture states and the two pieces fit together the way they should! I recommend this to anyone who has a brother, dad, boyfriend, or husband that likes camouflage .
These screen protectors are good if you want basic care of your screen. As in you just want it to keep your screen from having scratches and fingerprints. It isn't anything fancy, just a plain Jane screen protector. But it did fit well & if you know what your doing you shouldn't have bubbles. I would recommend this because of its price. It's well worth what you pay .
this book sucked so much i would never read it again. DO NOT BUY THIS IT IS NOT WORTH YOU STUPID TIME .
The best diary of a wimpy kid book yet!! Can't wait for more books to come out!!  Jeff Kinney did a great job...REALLY FUNNY .
is very interesting and easy to read book. Get you into life of others just like it is your own. I gave 10 out of 10 to author. Can't wait for more novels from Ameera .
enjoyed the series, would have preferred it to be in one book though. it does not download in order makes finding the right book a chore .
don't know why people rate it as 1. a rating below 5 is an insult to the game. the game is great, i played it and there seems to be no problem at all. Waiting for your next turn may take some time but it gives you a rest. the graphic is great, the battle is fun. it is really a 5 star .
I have used other braces that came undone when I sit down, but not this one. The Velcro provides a strong closure and it has not failed on me once. I have had it for a few months now and wish that I had found it sooner .
Very good product. I recommend it. Is you are looking for a good projector this is a amazing alternative. No doubt .
very good quality material. Although I haven't worn it yet but, I can't wait to wear it! I ordered a medium due to previous reviews gave me the idea that I shouldn't order a large and im glad I didn't because the medium fit perfect .
fit very well. My daughter loved the shoes. will probably order them in different colors. Can't beat the price. Thanks .
Need to add stickers for access areas not covered by case for better blending of colors. My phone is red and it really stands out against the black background of the case. Howeverr I really do love the design and it holds on nicely .
The material was not what I expected. The feel was quite cheap and less than what I would wear. I gave it to a friend .
I am not satisfied with the product. Is not what I have expected.Not enough information to lure in the usersI would not recomand it .
Not what I was expecting.The voltage is not working on it to show the V for the car.Display is very dim.I have ordered a different brand.This product is not worth the price of 15.99Disappointed with the product .
Great movie, gets better and better every time. It does have an enigmatic quality which no doubt contributes to the almost near obsessive replay value. So many tiny gems that at the end of the day, you have a full treasure chest of memorable jewels .
don't be fooled by the picture. It does not contain pomegranate. Does  contain pomegranate flavor. this is basically pomegranate flavored candy covered in chocolate. Don't be fooled by the picture .
Goes into so much detail of every Zelda game made and has a lot of artwork. Couldn't have asked for a better Zelda book .
When I got it in the box amazing but when I put it on it was not as firm as some if my other friends and the bottom thing for the charger spot keeps falling off! The front cover for the screen really touchy I actually took it off that's how bad it was and it said it was new not used! So not happy considering getting a new one .
Good reason to read a book and never put it down. I was really enthralled b  the book.David O .
This was labled for children, but I'm a senior citizen and I enjoyed it very much.  The pictures are very pretty, the sound very good, and the variety of birds excellent.  I learned a number of bird calls I did not know before .
Don't waste your money and time. It doesn't really work besides it only 20 bucks from dish. So just spend a few dollars more and get the real thing .
Awesome quality at a reasonable price. I was initially concerned that I wouldn't use all 100 cases, but I may have to order more. I have been able to get my craft room organized and can find stamps that I forgot I had. I would recommend this product highly to all the rubber stampers out there .
I loved this product. It looks exactly like the picture and is the perfect size. It is also very stylish for someone who does not want to spend a ton of money on a diaper bag .
It is very rewarding to listen to a piece of music that is not &#34;elevator music&#34; and very enjoyable.  Best results:  Listen in the early part of the day.  The effect is &#34;up and at em&#34; with a smile .
A grain of salt must be taken with the no exercise part, however on the whole, a good and rewarding read .
Different stories intertwined heading the same direction.  An exciting climax.  A warm hearted conclusion.  Once started, I could not put the book down.  It has been a long time finding an author such as Mr. Scott.  I am looking forward to his next offering .
well written and thought out, enjoyed it very much. author doesn't talk down to reader, but explains details well.good job .
noisemaker defective, only works when it decides to. frustrating for human if not the dog. wouldn't recommend this product for purchase .
I bought this cage for my two chinchillas because i wanted to put them together and have them be in a bigger can they were currently in. But when i recieved the package the first time not only were many of the parts rusted but they were bent or broken so i had to return it for another one. When I recieved the second one, it was still damaged but I wasn't going to return it because I had waited long enough to recieve it. Most of the problems I had to fix on my own which cause assembly to take longer than nessecary.But once it was assembled, it looked great and my chinchilla Coco (the other one passed unfortunately before he got to experience the cage) loves the cage. Its spacious and gives her alot of exercise room that she doesn't even know what to do with it.If i could have I wish I could have requested a fragile sticker or something on it in order to ensure the product is tampered with .
I've always loved Kingdom Hearts when I was younger but never had the system to play it on. When i finally got a PS3 I was excited to finally play all the games I hadn't gotten to when I was younger. The great thing about this version of Kingdom Hearts is that it can be played on the new PS3 models versus the regular PS2 games that are only compatible with the first few PS3 systems. I recommend this game for anyone who has a child and wants to keep them away from those violent shooters. I'm definatly going to buy Kingdom Hearts 2 when it's remade from what I read and also Final Fantasy X/X-2 when their remake is available in December .
This case is as cute as it is durable. Your phone sits in a rubber casing that fits very snug. Your phone won't be falling out .
Great product. Bought it for a friend and she loved them. No complaints. The blue lights are the best feature .
Only good for paper, peels off everything else as soon as it dries. If you are looking to paint on anything other than very porous paper do not buy.This is definitely NOT the same as the stuff we had in school. Purchased to use for a temporary window mural, but it peeled as soon as it started drying. It will stick if you apply hairspray to the glass but is transparent and comes off the instant anything touches it and forget applying a second coat or painting anywhere near finished areas such as outlines or a different color as the dry parts will immediately peel off if you so much as look at them the wrong way.If your looking for REAL tempera paint for anything other than porous paper this ain't it. The real stuff has been known to stay put for centuries this stuff comes off darn near everything you put it on almost as soon as it dries.As for overall value with shipping it was almost $50 for the set, a trip to the nearby "Walywurld" and you can get the same paint for maybe $20 .
It is what it is, which is basically the guts out of a $10 walkman stuffed into a somewhat decent case with a 1/4 inch plug and two 1/8" jacks.Literally all VOX did was tie the 1/4" plug into the playback head circuit with a trim pot to adjust distortion and slap it into a case with their logo on it.Sounds like crap even through cheapy headphones even my Bose headphones can't redeem the sound quality. Drags the tone of my Geddy Lee signature right down into the crapper...and it's pickups are capable of driving headphones without additional amplification! I'd hate to hear how bad this thing sounds with a cheaper bass.You could get the same quality rig by buying a cassette adapter, a 1/8" to 1/4" plug adapter and a cheapy portable cassette player spending on the high side $20...actually no, the DIY cassette rig would sound better .
Good for cheapy brushes.They are what they are.A high end set of sables they ain't, but then you can't even buy one good sable for the price of the set.I wouldn't recommend these for oil and canvas, but they're good enough for water colors, acrylics and tempera/poster paint .
Nice, doesn't run, very solid color when airbrushed.Fair warning goes on very vibrant and solid in color on buttercream and whipped icing but will fade significantly on whipped so spray it much heavier/darker than you are expecting the result to look like...I've never done it before but my wife with more than two decades experience doing cakes in bakeries walked me through it...our tie-dye cake started very, very dark and within an hour or so faded to a proper hippie tie-dye look .
I bought this set for the compressor.The only nuisance is it cycles a lot because it builds pressure very quickly...would be nice if cutoff and turn on pressure were adjustable to keep it from cycling so much, but for the price...On start up (especially the first time we ran it) it seems to struggle a little but it does not appear to be a major issue. It hasn't overheated even with long runs.The airbrushes are cheapy Badger clones but work well enough, as long as they are taken care of they will last for a long time. They produce nice lines, blends and fades. Three airbrushes with the compressor cost the almost as much one quality airbrush and no compressor, So it's pretty much impossible to come up with anything bad to say about them. You get what you pay for and then some. As I said above take care of them and they'll last, take the time to mix your paint and set them up right and they'll give good results. Bear in mind these are NOT a replacement for professional grade kit, but plenty good for hobby projects .
I was excited about this...but when I got it, it was so tiny...I don't know what I thought it would be but it's tiny...It was delivered on time and packed great .
I got this on time...I opened this and was not happy...It's really small toys...The price is ok but I expected more .
These are not really nice pieces...For the price I guess it's good...But I would not order this again..Sorry...It did ship ASAP .
I was so excited to get this in the mail...When I opened it the silver foil does not go all the way to the edge where the silver lip is and just ruins it...I would return it but it's not worth the cost to do so I am keeping it .
It's pretty except where the seams come together...and they look rough...course for the price it's not worth returning but I'm not thrilled with it .
These pads don't leak at all like the other pads do.The only draw back is the price. They do cst morebut they're well worth it .
I have had this case for a while and there is nothing wrong with how it is manufactured just the color. It has turned an ugly yellow brown color. I have tried everything to clean it even bleach! but nothing works. If you want an okay case get this case just in a different color .
I received my package; however there was nothing in it.  The package was open and item missing; nothing but the receipt was in the envelope. That was disappointing due to the fact that I needed the item right away .
Nice boot.fit as expected look very professional had no trouble with the boot.  Leather IS not real,but boot still looks great .
I learned a lot about lace wigs and types of glue.  I have tried three types of glue and nothing seems to work .
I wasn't sure they would be bright enough to light the interior of my small rv. They surprised me. I cut the strip in half and ran one down the underside of the cupboards on each side. Used a male plug from the charger of an old cordless drill I had for one and the female out of the drill for the other. Hooked them up,ran them to a switch and it's as bright as day in there in the middle of the darkest  night. I would recommend these to my friends and anyone else who wants inexpencive lighting for a motor home  or anything 12vdc. I need no other lights in mine.. Thanks, It's been my pleasure .
This bottle of gel lasts a long time. If you use about 1 pump of the product daily, it will last you 4-6 month. The product is great because it does not leave any flakes in your hair and remains soft and moldable long enough for you to style your hair. It leaves a nice shiny, hard finish and is a great value .
I was not like description, i try it with Nikon Coolpix P510 Camera, it was described as it work with this camera but it was very bad one, gives bluer images, the camera work better without this lenses except the filter lenses .

I love it....but by the time I finish this game I will have paid 500.00 or more just to play. Why weren't we offered first bid on the stocks? The creators are crafty. Love the game but I will never finish.TOO MUCH MONEY .
This is the first time I've ever written a review about anything, but after the horrible experience I've had with this case, I'm hoping to save a few other people some frustration.  I had trouble right away with this case.  First, the screen portion had air bubbles in it and was wavy, making it hard to use the touch screen on the phone.  Then, when it got so bad that I couldn't press the END button to end a call, I decided to contact the company. After waiting on hold for about twenty minutes, the CSR informed me that it was a counterfeit case.  So, since this was given to me as a Christmas gift, I'm not the only victim... my mother in law, who gave it to me, is out the money she paid for it.  I am beyond aggrivated at this point.  Please, DO NOT buy this case .
I loved this one. I have both Inferno and just finished Rapture. A beautiful love story. Rapture was defintely better than Inferno, however, you have to read Inferno first to get the love story. I love how Gabriel is so in love with his beloved Julia. They are beautiful characters. I would love to see this in a trilogy to see how things go from here and follow the truest love story. And I would also like to see how the other characters in the book work out also. Racheal, Scott, Tom and his new romance, Paul (if the true friendship can last), but more than anything I'd love to see a reaction from Christa to know that she could not keep these lovers apart .
I used this in conjunction with the Green Coffee Bean Exract and I lost 10lbs. in 2 weeks. The price is great here. I bought the green coffee bean and rasberry ketone from a health store and it cost me $70.00 for both. Here I bought both and added the african mango extract for $45.87. Can't beat that. This is an all natrual product made by Essential Source, you can check their website and read about all the products they offer. I'm still waiting on my order hopefully will come in soon. I've been out for about a week and I can tell a difference in how I feel. I'm back to feeling blah. I hate that feeling. Hope this helps anyone wanting to try. Oh and it doesn't taste to bad, reminds me of a cough syrup. But you only take it 2x a day under the tongue for about 30 seconds then swallow .
It's not the best tasting in the world, but it's not that bad. You only hold it under your tongue for about 30-60 secondsn 2x a day then swallow. You can drink something afterwords. Besides, I lost 10lbs. in 2 weeks of taking it in conjunction with the rasberry ketone. So I can definitely handle the taste. I'm not sure what percentage the chlorogenic acid is in it. But however I did loose weight. And the first 2 bottles (green coffee extract and rasberry ketone) I bought cost me $70.00. So this time due to a friend I ordered here on Amazon and got both the green coffee bean and rasberry ketone and added the african mango extract for about $45.00. I'm still waiting on my order but hopefully it will come in tommorow. I've been out for about a week and I can definetly feel a difference. Also remember taking this in liquid form makes it work faster since it is absorbed immediately under the tongue. Also this product is completely natural absolutely no additives. It is from Essential Source. You can check their website on these and other products. They have other products that I will be getting in the future but I will be ordering it from Amazon (way cheaper). Hope this helps anyone wanting to try it .
When characters are so real you feel like you know them, or would like to, you become emotionally involved in their story.  You have to keep reading to see what happens to them and how their story will ultimately be resolved.  Until then, you can't let them go.  Those are prerequisites for a good read in my opinion .
This odorless gel really works!  Having a topical alternative to systemic drugs is preferable to me and no side effects .
my dog seems to know what the remote is for ,he doesn't understand where the sound is coming from but he has stopped chasing the livestock and the cat since I put the receiver around his neck, for the price it was well worth the investment .
I recently bought the tablet and keyboard they work great and compliment each other. Keys are just right size for my fat fingers. Going to buy my son one for christmas. Now I don't have to tug around my laptop! It not white, its silver but it goes good with the white .
Awesome tablet!  Works great and carries all the needed programs that I use!  The keyborad has the USB port and I recenly found a mini USB flash drive at best buy. Or Amamzon sells the adapter which is real nice too. The 32 gig memory is good enough for me as well as &#34;MY CLOUD &#34; file storage supported by ASUS. The only drawback is the camera is really only good outdoors (no flash). Got my tablet overnight via Fed Ex .
JUST RECEIVED THE 3 SATCO BULBS. NONE OF THE SPECS SHOWED THE DIAMETER OF THE GLOBE TOP. THESE ARE 5".  THE BULBS I HAVE PURCHASED IN THE PAST ARE 4.5" THE 5" ARE TOO BIG TO FIT IN THE TOOL I HAVE BEEN USEING TO INSERT THIS TYPE OF BULB.MY CEILINGS ARE 12ft HIGH, AND I AM TO OLD TO USE A 10 FOOT LADDER .
much quieter than a Hyundia that I purchased from amazon several years ago, a big mistake.reaches pressure quickly. I only use to blow out, so can't speak for how it works with tools .
I have used the NB811 shoes for years. it is now discontinued. I read the review of the new 812, and decided to change.Since I use a custom insert  in both the left and right shoe, i took a gamble that this would work. The stride is more lively then the 811, the support is as good, but my feet feel warmer( i live in Florida) when I am just sitting around. They are Not made in the U.S.A. I think once I get used to the difference that they will be fine for the live of the shoe .
This book guides you through the six weeks, give you choices so you are not eating the same thing everyday .
My UAG phone case is even better than I expected looks nice and protects my phone. I've dropped it several times and not evena ding. I highly recommend this product .
the Jolie Pleasures Plug is not that good of a product for a few reasons, first of all it is very soft and is very flexible which you may think is a good thing untill you try and leave it there without using the finger hold, i almost lost it inside myself on a few occasions that is why iv stopped using it, but if your looking for something that you don't just want to keep in place then i would recomend it just dont ever let go of the finger hold .
I ordered size for 2T but the pant didn't fit at all although he is 14 months !!! I live in jordan and was very annoyed .
Didn't like it at all .. It doesnt stick well i put it for one day then i removed it disnt like it at all .
love it but it isn't a boot its like a socks shaped like a boot .. but its a good one with the band .
Didn't like it , i ordered size 18-24 MN but it fits a 3 year old and the white cotton not beautiful .
This Mud Pie Set is really amazing and don't look up to the size chart i bought the 12/18 months for my 11 months babyhe looked amazingg .
It's not the exact one for my planer.  But I can make it work.  I believe the issue is with Stanley and their marking / nomenclature .
Since Army Basic Training I have tried to stay with Asics running shoes.  In Afghanistan the PX only carries Brooks and some other brand.  I was forced to buy the Brooks which hurt my feet and fell apart.  I found the Asics GEL-Extreme 33 on Amazon for a great price and bought them.  My feet are thanking me and I'm back to running.  I just completed 500 miles, and am heading to 1,000 miles.  Asics never let me down .
This keyboard protector is a simplistic covering keeping the keys clean, but the right hand side does not sit properly over the keys. This causes the right side to lift; it seems a few millimeters too wide to fit correctly .
All episodes except two were the same as season two. also it wouldn't play on My main dvd player.Played on computer and one dvd player that I don't use very much .
Great book,  Good story from beginning to end. can't wait to start part two . Can't wait to see if both of black ice son's meet and what will happen .
The game is awesome but it asks you for an update and then you can't play till Yuri get the update, but there is no update .
This should be everybody's go to when trying to lose weight. If you have to kick your metabolism in to gear I swear this is the only thing out there that actually works. Dr. Ian did it with this diet plan. I actually didn't lose much weight on it because I could not follow it myself. Its actually not hard to follow but in my home I live with the pickiest eaters in the world. My hubby and kids refused to eat the dinners I made so then I couldn't follow the plan and I was not making 2 different meals at dinner , that's a waste of time. Also I had trouble eating breakfast everyday I don't have time to cook eggs and the other stuff. But I tried to stick to it as much as possible and it does work because I had tons of energy. One day when my kids are older I pull the book out an try it again. It just doesn't fit into my lifestyle right now. But if you don't have the problems I have , it will work for you .
Fits all my pot lids perfect. I hang it on the wall because it wouldn't fit in any of my cupboards. I ended up painting is silver to match the stainless steel appliances.I wish it came in different colours. But it does the job .
I chose 3 stars because it was hard to mount on the wall. It was crooked when I received it. But I made it work. Plus wish it came with the bottles that fit in because the ones I have are too small and topple over. I mean you can fit any spice bottles in it but the bottle are sold separately which I don't feel like paying $30 for spice bottles .
This aquarium is sweet. I love the lights it makes your room glow. My only problem was the filter it came with is not very good. It doesn't keep the tank very clean. I would suggest getting something different if you want more than 5 fish. I found I was taking the water out and cleaning the entire tank every 2 weeks because of the build up algae and fish flakes the fish didn't eat. That's actually bad because your fish will be stressed from changing they're environment all the time. Most of the fish actually died Also do not put those claw frogs in there either, the tank won't be able to keep up with the mess they leave at all. I tried even putting a different pump in there but it just will not work because of the shape of the tank. I think if you want to buy this tank it has to be for looks only. To be able to maintain the aquarium and keep the fish healthy I suggest only having 3 very small fish .
Lights up the room with crazy colours. I bought it as a night light for my daughter. Has 8 different lighting options which is cool. But the lights change really fast which is kind of defeating the purpose of a night light. I thought the colour would change slower to be more soothing so it could help her fall asleep not be like a night club with flashing lights. It is very bright. Doesn't matter though she loves it and thinks its pretty. Its just a plus for me because saves me on hydro so she doesn't have her lamps on all night. It also come with batteries. Delivery arrived on time as well .
Honestly , this product didn't live up to what I thought it was. I purchased the Aquarius Aq360-6g Gloview 6-Gallon Aquarium Kit and this fish ordainment does not glow like I thought it. Its just a blue plant .
This package is awesome. The workouts are great you really feel the burn! If your out of shape these workout will kill until you get use to them. I was working out to the &#34;Lean Legs&#34; and I couldn't walk right for 4 days. Its worth it though. One thing about these DVD's, the trainer , I had a hard time not laughing at her. Maybe it just me but she wears the most hideous lip stick and its hard not to laugh at her faces she makes , so I breakdown laughing throughout the workout. But all laughing aside, you get great workouts .
It was delivered on time which was surprising which was great. Usually I buy bigger sizes just in case because you never want it to be too small. I ordered a medium and it is usually too small but the medium was a little big actually. But other then that great product .
It easy to sign paper because I don't have to trun on my computer and open my e-mail it take a long time.  I just to my tablet and download app and sign papers and send to someone .
I received a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review*I&#8217;ll start off by saying thank to the author for allowing me to be one of the lucky people who received an ARC copy of this book. In case I somehow fail to make the point in my review the most important thing to know about this book is that it is really good and if you have not read it yet, you should.One of the things I noticed and liked about the book was the pacing. Normally an author will go slow and set up the story and each character so that you get to know them properly before the conflict of the book starts. While that is a good thing for books that are longer, it also means that for me at least since the good part is hardly in the beginning I am able to put the book down and come back to it later. This one however jumps right into the storyline without feeling rushed.I loved Jenna&#8217;s character. It&#8217;s been a while since I read a book with strong heroine who doesn&#8217;t lose her mind and opinion just because of a guy. Jenna was an independent and strong woman who did not back down to others despite them trying to intimidate her. I mean to go back to the small town where your mom got caught sleeping with the mayor and led you to being a victim of the vicious rumor mill takes some serious lady balls. Another thing I loved about Jenna was her loyalty. Without revealing spoilers, I will say that Jenna&#8217;s attitude towards some people was very admirable despite what was happening. Like I said earlier, she was a strong character who did base her actions on a guy.The relationship between her and Josh I really liked how he did not judge her despite of the rumors. I loved how protective he was of her and although sometimes his actions were misguided at times, I never doubted his feelings for her. Josh frustrated me with how he reacted to some things but it wasn&#8217;t until the end that it all made more sense although I could still not justify what he had done. However his redeeming quality was that he was just caught in a difficult situation and he was trying to do his best to deal with it.My one complain about the book is the length. Now I&#8217;m not sure if it&#8217;s because I'm used to reading 250+ page books that anything under that just seems like too little or that it was actually a little short. But yeah while the story was not rushed at all I would have liked for it to be a little longer and see some interaction between Jenna and other people who weren&#8217;t Josh.As far as the ending is concerned I have to say that I have had my fair share of experience with books where I do not like the ending. Then after a couple of days of thinking about it I will sometimes realize that the author had a good point in ending the book the way that they did (except for you John Green, your endings kill me). This book was no exception, I had mixed feelings about it at first but now I am glad that the author chose to end it that way because it was true to the type of person that Jenna was .
I bought one and after using for two weeks the push button of the pulse fell off and I could not find it .
This case was perfect for my daughters 3ds and she loved it. It fit perfect now I know she won't damage her game system .
Had problems pretty much from the start. Customer service was great helped me resolve the first issue froze up. Then it started acting up again a few weeks later and I just gave up on it. Nothing against the seller but this tablet is crap. It is slow even with added memory and now won't even boot up just says updating.....and never stops updating...no matter how many times you reset it .
I heartily recommend this book to health care providers working with the chronically ill, as well as faculty preparing providers to work with people living with chronic illness. In a world with myriad definitions of "health" and "healing", chronic illness cannot be fixed with medicine or surgery. Using a mix of personal stories and simple truths, Ms. Amsden's thoughtful and engaging book proposes a new way of looking at our lives, and our journeys. Medicine absolutely plays an important role, and it is most effective when people can approach it with a positive outlook. Share this book with your students. Share this book with each of your patients. Wherever life finds us, this elegant collection of stories prepares us for true healing .
I love these jeans!! They are a tad long but looks amazing around the waist and butt! When you walk in a room people can't help but to stare at these Jeans .
it said leather i thought it would be a better quality its ok just not as nice as i thought it would be .
I am never disappointed with Southern Living recipes.  This cookbook has great illustrations and directions for a avid cook or beginner .
Everything was shipped very fast. Loved the heat sink and fitted perfectly in my pc. Keeps my pc very cool and have nothing against it .
Liked the product worked great, but the thing I didn't like was that 3 of the 4 pins didn't actually bring 4 pins it brought 3 but even without it the fans worked great and ships very fast. Great product for good price .
This book really shows a person what it means to have Gods grace. When a person has Gods grace no matter what trial or tribulation that he or she might be going through with his grace you will know everything will be alright .
I remember reading this book as a kid. I saw it on kindle store and bought it. I was a little shocked when no one else in the house had heard it before. I read it to my grand daughter and she loved it and enjoyed the pictures very much .
I love it when an author can bring you into their made up world and make you feel like a friend, confidant, or family. Having a special child of my own I could relate to the teacher and her madcap class. I've also spent time in similar classrooms and enjoyed the uniqueness of each and every child. Her story drew me into their world and had me laughing so hard my family thought I had lost my mind, so I shared the passage so they could laugh with me. Read this book if you enjoy a book with strong women, you won't regret it .
It doesn't matter what name she uses, you are guaranteed an exceptional read.  The dynamic of the characters are hard to find, and she leaves you craving another peek into their world .
Loved the book just as the ones before it.  I started with the first one at school then my mom said there was a second book and she bought it and I couldn't stop figgiting for this book and it amazed me just as the ones before .
The first time I started reading this book, life interrupted. When I finally got back to it I had to restart it. It is a good book. One the will make it into my favorites. I appreciate that Jolie isn't led by her hormones as so many women in books are these days. She is also strong, but still needs her friends to center her without using them as a crutch .
I literally stayed up til 4:30 in the  morning reading this book. I got Bound by Blood yesterday. The lovely Mrs . Jackson has created a realistic storyline, that doesn't include sparkling vampires and I am hooked. My only real complaint  are the covers, if the man in book has long blond hair, then the cover should not have short dark hair!  Other than the cover this series is outstanding. Just what a person wants in a book ...... ..a bit of fantasy, comedy, romance, and mystery .
I was lucky enough to get Graveyard Speaks free and once I finished, I immediately went looking for this one. Haven't finished yet. A must read .
I really like this type of game. The storyline was predictable though. Gave five stars  mainly because it is a good time waster. It is not one of my favorites and may not play again. Had plenty of hunt and find but I felt some were pointless. They didn't need all they put in and the story would've flowed better without some of them but I think they wanted to make sure purchaser had more game time. Which I am all for. But maybe they  could've put in more mini puzzles n place of the pointless hunt and finds. This sounds bad and you may be wondering why I gave it five stars, the game played well with no glitches and it can't be easy to try to make a game to please everyone. G5 has never failed in making games I enjoy. They deserve the stars because I just may be too critical you should definitely try the game yourself. You will get your money worth of time spent playing .
In my opinion any game without PERMISSIONS is worth looking into. I happen to love word games and have some of this companies other word games. This game is very fun. Some of their groupings made me pause, but they did make sense, just remember they don't always go with  the most obvious answer. So far halloween is my favorite but Valentine's is easiest. Take a chance with this FAOTD, YOU will have fun .
I found this in the children's section of kindle books. This is not a children's book! This book is a soapbox for the author. And the poems are not "inspirational" at all. The author trying to label this a children's book is the most horrifying part of all. I understand her desire to teach children to find other supplements to replace what is found in meat, but there is nothing on God's green earth that would compel me to read this book to a child. I do have a question though, near the end of the book, she writes about a mouse that got inside her house. She does not say how she got it out of her house, why not .
I like games that aren't too easy. This one is definitely not too easy. It's also got a nice mix of games. My biggest problem with it is that it keeps wanting you to advertise for them in facebook. I don't go on Facebook and definitely don't want to let everyone know all my guilty pleasures. I wish that like sound effects there was a button so you could turn this off. Also, game lost the star because it asked me after every chapter to leave a review. If I like your game I won't need to be asked to review it. This should b knocked back to every fourth or fifth level. I didn't hit the don't ask again because I intended to leave one....so fix your game so it stops pestering people .
As a parent I try out the apps before giving to the kids. The app quit 3times with my first picture choice so I selected another. Using a stylus and my finger the app didn't respond well. No matter what I did I couldn't do the fine detail some of the pics required. I would not recommend this app. I have already deleted it .
I have played a lot of mahjong games over the years, this one isn't the worst I have played. The graphics are nice and the fact that I can turn the music and noises off is a big bonus. But the game is glitch. In the middle of play it will stop n boot me. That doesn't endear this version enough to buy the full version. If that gets fixed it will be one to buy .
I don't leave a lot of reviews but this app has been out a while an d deserves a review. When you get a free app it is hit or miss.  This is a great story. Read in a clear voice. Interactive part is basic, touch the animal and it swims away, giving the child the chance to count each before it zooms off the page. The only reason I didn't give five stars is because the page after the interactive animals it simply says &quot;2 Seahorses!&quot; for example but there are no seahorses.. I would have liked to have seen the animals too. Teaching your child anything involves a lot of repetition. Giving them another chance to count would've reinforced the number counted better.  But all in all, most free books are not always this well done. Thank you for giving us a great book .
Kids have clumsy finger. Please fix the size of images n number dots. Loves the amount of images. Don't recommend til updated with larger images .
I play this game to help me unwind while also working my brain.  I don't like the ads and constant pop ups .
This book was great. I got it for the kids but as I was previewing the book I started laughing. You can't help yourself! As you read you say to yourself this is what  this friend does and that one is done well by that friend. My husband likes to rate burps, but I really think Tristan has given kids, and adults, a start at setting up a fart rating system. Will definitely be looking for book two .
I enjoyed reading the depot. If you enjoy reading books that end on a cliff hanger, like a soap opera, then you will enjoy this book also. I personally do not like soaps. They are a waste of time. When I get the time to sit down and read a book I don't want to be angry with the author at the end of it. I choose short stories because they allow me to enjoy a little down time  without wondering when I will get a chance to finish a book. Unlike other prequels I have read this one actually leaves you feeling like some one stole your brownie after the first bite. Before you read this make sure she has published THe Library first .
I loved this book. After reading it I couldn't believe it was free. This book is very interactive. It gives you  a view from a telescope as well as a flashlight type effect so you can see in the dark surrounding main character. Also has a couple mini games. They  don't have to be played during the reading of the book but I can see that they appeal to kids. My 4 yr old granddaughter enjoyed this book.  As for myself I both enjoyed the story and the layout. Thank you for this great free book. I highly recommend .
Finding short stories that are great is getting harder to do. The story never felt rushed and felt like something you would hear sitting around a campfire with your friends. I will definitely put this in my favorites list and look for more by this author .
Amazing story! I would recommend this book to everyone.  I couldn't put it down.  I am impatient for book 2!  The characters are given with enough detail to draw you into their lives and have you rooting for them, or hating them. Gave 4stars because of all the errors, when you have to try to decipher what is being said it slows the pace and flow of the story .
I got this book as a freebie, and I am glad I did. If you want a great, quick read, this book is for you. I didn't find it scary or suspenseful but I had to know what happened next. The author doesn't fill the book with unnecessary information to draw out the story, just gives you a great story. I hadn't heard of this author before and now I am wondering why. As soon as I finished this book I went looking for Sinister Entity and when I finish it I will definitely go looking for his other books. Thank you Hunter Shea .
Sat down with my 4 yr old granddaughter thinking we would have a fun few minutes. Did not happen. A lot of the differences are miniscule. She quickly grew bored. I challenged others to spot the differences and no-one I asked could find all the differences. If u want a challenge then this is for you .
I loved reading this book. I hope the author writes more books about these interesting characters. Was a quick read but nothing was rushed. Characters had detail and kept you coming back to  find out what happens next. Plot had a twist I didn't see coming. Get this book and find a quiet corner! Enjoy .
It is a fun game. Putting picture together myself to get answer would've been better. Not sure I trust an app that pays for ratings within first ten pics .
Couldn't beat the price so I thought I'd give it a try. It's faster paced than some of the other games out there, which I like. Works well on my kindle. So far. Wonderful for relaxing .
So i picked out a few of the free puzzles, one of them was the sea shells pack. I was down to the last two pieces. I looked at the last two pieces, then went back and swiped my finger over the puzzle to see if I had messed up. Nope, the last two pieces didn't fit the two spaces I had left. I realize I am using a free puzzle but this doesn't induce to buy the app. Otherwise I love the game and enjoy playing. Except when I have left over pieces that don't fit puzzle .
I am looking forward to trying some of these recipes out. Unfortunately one of the best sounding recipes does not have ingredient list...the Bavarian mint...would love to try it. I didn't find many recipes I won't try in this book...except maybe the one recipe with no coffee added. I do recommend this book for anyone that likes coffee with a little spice. I will come back and update this review once I have tried a few .
Because of the pics on the cover and the description I thought this book would be good for younger kids. This book is not. This book would be enhanced with descriptive pics so a kid would know where in the body the author is describing. Facts are fine but they are not going to keep a child's attention long enough to learn them .
This is a really nice book. Haven't made any of the flowers yet but when I do I think I will combine some of the flowers to give a more realistic /3D effect. It will be fun to play with these patterns and see what I come up with. My only problem with this book was that some of the flowers looked rushed and sloppy. Thank you for the book. I love that this book  has sparked my and my daughter's imagination. The finished photo of the flowers were great, I've got other books where the photo of finished project was not included and the pattern itself wasn't clear. This book also jumps right into the patterns with the understanding that person reading the book has a basic understanding of  crochet. Most books out there start by teaching crochet. Which is nice, but most people looking for patterns are doing so because they know how to crochet and are looking for something to make .
I downloaded this app the last time it was offered for free because of the rave reviews. I didn't play it more than an hour before removing it from my kindle. It just didn't hold my interest. I wish I understood the reasoning behind offering it a second time. It's not that good an app .
I got this app as faotd. I listen to audiobooks and play this game to unwind before bed. Problem is if I don't set an alarm I lose track of time, which in my opinion is what makes a good app. It has enough settings to let you choose exactly how difficult  you want it. The animations are cute but eats the batteries .
I find it interesting that the investigator in this vampire game looks like Keanu Reeves. When he talks, with that British voice, it throws me a little. I wouldn't say fixing things in the boiler room are adventurous, but maybe that's why I don't get paid the big bucks. I'm not very far into the game but so far I have no idea where it's going. So far the games seem pointless. But try the game for yourself. It's not the worst game I've ever played but I'm not sure if it'll make it to my faves list either .
My mom  and sister started teaching me to cook atAge 11. In turn I started teaching my son's when they were 11. I taught them the same way I learned, a little of this and that. Worked great til it was my youngest son's turn to learn. He can only cook be recipe. It was so frustrating for both of us I stuck to box meals. They are all adults now but I think this book will help him. Everyone should know how to cook for themselves. It not only saves money but when they sit down to eat a good meal they cooked, it gives them a sense of pride and accomplishment..my youngest is now learning and just like her brother's, I enjoy watching her face after the first bite. The smile she gives herself is amazing .
I love bats. So in turn I have tried to teach my kids to love them. Most kids love to learn big words. At 2 to 3 yrs old they knew what echo location. I realize this book was meant as an overview but come on, telling someone that a bat sees with their ears and then not to tell them how they do it is just poor story telling .
Wasn't sure about this game at first, but I really enjoyed playing. The quilt pictures you are uncovering are beautiful. I recommend this app or others by GabySoft,  I haven't found one yet that didn't entertain me while I wasted time. The one thing I'd like to see included, and my reason for only four stars, is to give this app some type of penalty. You can just stumble along pushing buttons and still uncover the picture. I would also like to see an option of timing the puzzles, or something so that there is some way of showing you improvement in the game. But I would like these to be optional so that a kid can stumble along and uncover the pictures without penalty like the game is set up now .
This title was very misleading. I thought there would be patterns. Even one would have been nice. Title should have been Websites to help you learn to crochet for baby.....oh wait, you don't need a book after reading that title! This book started out like it was going to share a pattern, kinda, then it jumps to web sites that allow you to print patterns. Overall this book was confusing. If I could I wouldn't have given any stars .
I can appreciate wanting to try to help others by sharing your expertise. However, proofreading is really mandatory if English is not your first language. I read the reviews before getting this but thought it couldn't be that bad. I'm sorry, but it's worse. Ms. Martin please make the effort to have this edited. You've got me curious now as to exactly what square hooks and Japan hooks are, not to mention what some of the other information refers to.  I am always hungry to know more, and if you fix this I guarantee I will update my review .
Picture on cover is what you are being taught in this book. If you are looking to learn how to crochet, this is not the book for you. Actually, I learned by watching videos on YouTube. Then I looked at books, magazines and tv shows. This book has information. It has one pattern followed by more info. It's not a bad book but title is misleading. I suggest you get this book while it's free, but use it as a guide and one of your tools to help you learn to crochet. But be aware that it won't teach you in your first steps of crochet .
I was amazed by a lot of the information I found in this book. I will actually reference this book in the future, which is not something I can say about a lot of books I have looked at over the years when looking for natural and preventative foods. I didn't give five stars because after only a couple pages I could tell the author is not a native English speaker. Some of the wording set the information of balance and I had to reread to try to figure out what author was trying to say. Not because of spelling errors either. I think Mrs Cooper did an amazing job. The book is full of great information, just please have the book proofread by an English speaking person. I would happily come back and update my review and give five stars .
If you buy the tulip kit this book probably covers what's in each kit.  I found this book to be sparse. I expected to see a pic at end of each project. Especially since some were done in different colors from beginning pic. Gave four stars because it is what it says. Unfortunately what isn't said is that it is one long tulip tie dye commercial .
I heard her on the radio and I must of bought the wrong CD cause the songs I head are not on it. Very bummed .
This back pack is your standard Jansport bag, but the quality is perfect. I can see myself using this for me entire college career. The straps are comfy, the bag itself is not too bulky or large but like a tardis, it's bigger on the inside than it appears .
I got this for my boyfriend as a Christmas gift because he's been wanting to get a big tattoo but he doesn't have the funds for it. Naturally, I saw this as a very fitting gift for him. It's bigger than I had expected, which is good because then it can hold more change. All in all, it's a cute and funny lil' bank and it did make me crack up when I took it out .
My boyfriend bought this for me as a Christmas present after seeing it on my wishlist and I adore it. The pattern is really cute and it fits my Macbook Pro 13&#34; perfectly. Some people say that it's either too big/too small for their laptops but I also have a transparent case on my Macbook which makes it a tad bigger in size so it fits nice and snugly in this case. As for the smell, to me it smells like a brand new pair of shoes, which I love, so it's not bothersome at all. Even if that scent is bothersome to some, the scent does ware of. Overall, I feel very comfortable putting my laptop in the case and keeping it in an overnight bag or duffel bag. I also have some room to store my charger and a pair of head phones so it's perfect for traveling with all my computer needs .
Purchased 12 of these units for conducting roadside work.  They work well for their purpose, but with wear and tear, the top cap falls off and becomes unusable (until duct tape is applied).  Aside from that, a good purchase based on price, but needs to be handled with care.  Not designed to be used as miniature lightsabres, but can withstand this type of abuse .
This screen was a perfect fit for my sony xperia play.  I have been using the replacement part for a few months now and it is operating with no issues.Screen allows for a easy repair job and can be done in approximately 10 minutes.  Well worth the money for the part versus a new phone or paying someone else to fix .
The doll did not come with the stylus pen and when doing with hands its not as cool to the child .. Thumbs down .
Great book!!Couldn't put it down once I started reading it!What a great love story! Shows you can over come a lot when you have that kind of attraction and love .
Love this book!  I can not wait for the next one! If any one is interested in a good series, the White House Chef is the one to read.  The recipes are great too .
Speakers are loud and clear. They work great! Ive had no problens with this product. A great buy.  Sooo..... yeah .
size was not stated in ad so I assumed they were the size from the eye doctor.  They were quite a bit smaller which limits what they can be used for .
i did not get my memory saver i still want it icant buy any thing from you till i get my tool STILL WAITING .
I think it has very valuable contents, very useful for medicine students who want to learn antimicrobials.I don't like the one page format, because if you want to study a table, you need to see the left column and the upper crow of the table. With the actual format you can't see both, because the tables are divided in two parts. Also you can't read it in a iphone, if you want to see it in the hospital, for example .
This is the funniest book I can remember reading, I laughed out loud through the whole thing, have read Marian Keyes before and this is her best so far. Can't wait to read about the rest of the Walsh sisters .
Great read, not my favourite Lesley Pearse but still good! Interesting plot, didn't want to put it down! Yes I would recommend it .
This book has me anticipating its next volumes! I literally could not put it down and spent the entire second half of the book gasping or with my mouth agape! My emotions ebbed and flowed along with the characters.  I am left with an appreciation for men of integrity and feeling completely empowered as a woman .
A very bad quality it is very expensive and it is diferent in the picture. Idon't like at all. Sorry .
I personally loved both movie's. So, I won't to say I just doubled my pleasure. I would recommend if you like this kind of show .
They are comfy is why I chose them. I have no other comments to say about this pair of houseshoes .
Hope to never need it but when it come to electronics you can never be prepared enough, but better to have and not need it to need it and not have it .
Who can have any type of play station or x box and not have Madden football????? Get it and go touchdown's .
If you have iphone 5 do not purchase it is not compatible and does not work!!! Don't waste your money on this. IT DOES NOT WORK .
My husband has been resisting his urologist's recommendation of surgery for over a year because of all the horror stories he had heard about the after effects of surgery.  His problem was a a very enlarged prostate.  The doctor said the medications were not working as each visit showed no reduction in the size of his prostate. He bought a bottle of this and used it for about 3 weeks (along with his prescribed medication) prior to his next urologist visit.  The doctor said that he no longer needs surgery.  Although, the doctor thought it probably had nothing to do with the Life Extensions, we know differently.  He ran out of it and his problems with flow, speed returned almost immediately.  (He had tried other OTC saw palmetto in the past and had no results.)  This has made my husband extremely happy because surgery is no longer in the picture .
This is a beautiful leather case.  I thought I had ordered brown, but apparently not as I received a black one.  Exceptional quality .
The left earbud broke as soon as I took it out of the package. Cheap quality. Don't recommend them at all .
This very basic travel bag is much larger than I expected. It comes with a flat bottom insert that makes it easy for packing. Shoes can go in either of zippered sides. I put my phone charger in the front zippered compartment. I believe that it is not airline quality but for road trips it is perfect. It could be more attractive but for the price you can't beat it .
one cover is broken when I receive it!!! why? I can't believe..I wait more than 2 months. how shall I do .
I am an avid maker of rubber band figures and bracelets, etc.  I came across these Rainbow Braid bands and decided to give them a try.  So many bands made by other companies did not hold up to the rigors of looming them, let alone keep from breaking or lasting very long once made.  All I can say is the Rainbow Braid bands are awesome.  I made several action figures for the neighbor children and the bands held up to all the stretching and pulling making action figures require.  I would definitely buy these again and I recommend them to everyone.  Thanks Rainbow Braids for making an awesome product .
I like the color and durable quality of the cover's fabric.  It's not fancy but serves a practical purpose to keep a household applicance clean and secure .
Wallet has the capacity to hold what I need -- various cards, paper money, coins and keys.  Its appearance is acceptable, and I like the window that shows my driver's license without having to take it out of the wallet.  However, the wallet's coin purse is not durable.  The fabric inside the leather cover has frayed, and the snap is coming loose.  I've had to use tape to hold the cover together .
Its easy to install and hopefully will last longer than the three years the first one did.  It seems sometimes my two dogs both want to enter/exit at the same time and that was the cause of failure of separtation of one of the segments.  Nowhere in the instructions does it tell me how to teach my dogs, ladies first to avoid this problem .
These jeans fit perfect. This is the second time I've bought them. They're the exact color that is shown and are delivered fast. I hate shopping in the store. I get what I want and I don't have to leave my house .
does not tell tool size or ring size .
The case does it all for me. Its one of the best all around cases out there. It functions as a stand that works in every position. You read reviews about the tablets slipping out of the grooves and falling. I have never had that problem with this case. It stands up very sturdy and to a great amount of poking and pressure. It also has a great slim profile that makes it easy to take anywhere. Its an awesome case .
The characters are unpredictable & Norma somehow believes everything's okay with her sultry adolescent demeanor and ways. Love it! You never know what will conspire next. Next season, I'll wait to purchase the whole season because it drives me crazy waiting for the next episode .
This cost me $1.29 and it works better that any charger I have ever bought.  This even has a safety release so It will not come undone during travel. Great price and works perfectly .
Was easily applied and seemed thick and works great and arrived very fast. I have dropped it since i applied it and not a scratch .
I am very particuliar about the wallets I purchase.  It must have several card slots and at least 2 zipper compartments.  This wallet has that and more! It is so soft and the zipper work great.  the front compartment is perfect for change. I got the Espresso color and I love it.  It holds my checkbook and I still have room for extra things if needed.  I would usually never pay this much for a wallet, but I got tired of the cheapies breaking on me.  This is very well made and I should have this for years to come.  I would highly recommend this to everyone .
These sandals are VERY cute, don't get me wrong, I just didn't expect them to be so cheaply made. They definitely can't be used for every day walking, but if you just want them to look cute, they're great. They were alright for how much I paid for them though so I can't complain too much .
WOW! I received a Pilot Acroball Pure White pen from Influenster for testing purposes and it was AMAZING! I used it to write an entire research paper and GUESS WHAT... Unlike most pens, it wrote smoothly and didn't smudge at all! It was so much cuter than a regular pen and felt better while I was holding it, but I didn't expect it to write so much better too. I would definitely recommend this pen to everyone .
The fabric is very soft. Appears to be well made. For this low price you can not go wrong. I like that it is reversible .
I have to say that not only is this book amazing but also it answers everything I could have ever asked. I have read both of this authors books and they are just perfect! I love this book and I refer back to it very often. I find it hard to get help in the area I live as I work so much and theres not anywhere to go to be taught. This book has already taught me a great deal. It not only covers how to throw but also the position you should be in and common errors. I am also going back to the author's website (pottery-on-the-wheel.com) and reading the blogs posted there as well as they can be very informational and helpfull too. I cannot wait for this author to produce a third book.SincerelyKatrina from Florida .
I was researching MSM pills for my hair, but stumbled across info about the cream for skin. After reading the reviews, I ordered a jar. I am now on my 3rd jar and LOVING IT! I was the queen of acne/oil face crap, and now only use this!! My prescription face cream can't even compare to this!! I have my sister and mom both using it now. I had super oily and acne prone skin, and now since using this after washing my face, it has disappeared! I hope they never stop making this stuff .
i love my new island. I had to have a contractor put it together for me, but it was well worth it. The only thing is one of the cabinet doors were a tad off, but no biggy! Also, the corners stick out further, so watch it when you're standing up close and go to walk away... I stub my toes on them all the time .
These are ok I guess. I bought them for P3 of the HCG Diet since there are no sugar, syrup, etc.I probably would not buy them again, but I will finish them no problem. There just really isn't much of a flavor at all .
I am the HCG Queen, so anything even remotely related to it, I am going to check it out. This was the worst dressing I have ever tasted in my life. It is pure water with ZERO taste. For almost $16 a bottle, this is A JOKE! I also ordered the other flavor; same thing. I am extremely disappointed, and prefer my OACV and Lemon Juice dressing I make myself, for a fraction of the price. I cannot believe people are saying this is good .
This book is beyond perfect and the ensuing is just so adorable I feel like if you read looking for Alaska and then read this book you wouldn't be able too contain your feels it's a great book I promise you worth reading .
It is always good to read a wonderful story. No. Bad words no fighting. You are made to feel like your part of the family .
great book love Joyce she does not hold back .
this i mounted under my cabnet. i read other peoples coments. I put the screws going down the cabnet from the inside then cut just a small amout off the screw so it would not touch the light. worked great. instead of the screw sticking up into the cabnit .
love this game was on it a lot fun and intertaining.  keeps the mind working. no bordom when you play and time goes by fast .
I used it and it worked great  can't see the screen during the day . got me to my destination no problem .
have this in both cars so i am ready to go with my gps witch is very helpful so i don't get to lost .
so so...kind of over rated lol.  It didn't come out as clean as I wanted to at the end and alcohol scratched it up .
I don't use my phones internet due to all the other device I have so the mobile hotspot use battery power. This is a great solution to my power or having to be connected to an outlet problem. fits great and the silicon covers that you can get on amazon fits perfectly over the hard case .
I love this game I have found myself playing for hours in one sitting. Ads never get in the way I barely notice them. I love that you can play against the computer in solo games and that it does not force me to play on line with friends. I have never had a problem with the game. I highly recommend it .
I'm going to be honest. My love of this game stems mainly from my nostalgia towards it. I opened up this baby on Christmas '03 and from then on it defined my childhood. Let me also be the first to say that this is NOT a genre-defining revolutionary 3-D platformer such as Super Mario 64 or Banjo Kazooie/Tooie, the likes of which it very obviously emulates. It is, at heart, a gigantic fetch quest with only very basic gaming mechanics that anyone who's played the aforementioned games would recognize in a heart beat. All that sounds pretty underwhelming, so why do I like it so much. Well, it's not just nostalgia. The game comes with 13 huge levels to explore, all based directly off of areas from the show. The designers did a perfect job of matching the game world to what we know from the show. Every inch of this game oozes Spongebob, from the sky being decorated with flower clouds, to the absolutely amazing voice-acting. The writing in this game is off the wall hilarious! The music varies from place to place and isn't anything special, it does its job adequately, except for the boss music which is honestly some of the most epic video game tunes I've ever heard. Speaking of bosses, the three main ones are terrific and some of the best I've ever fought. The visuals are not technically the greatest but they fit the art style of the show and you immediately forget the fact that they've aged quite a bit in 9 years. The gameplay is your standard 3-D platforming fare, with added twists (like tongue-boarding) combined with the overall zaniness of each level that keeps things surprisingly interesting. The game itself is relatively easy to get through, but there are some missions that really stand out as very challenging. 100% completion will probably take about 15-20 hours on the first try, so it does have a very good length. But what stands out the most is the developers' love of the show, and it's obvious once you start playing. If you are a fan of the show, this game is a MUST-BUY! No questions asked! It is an interactive extension of the show that manages to pack every bit of joy from the cartoon into a tiny disc and actually do it right. It is NOT a sloppy licensed title by any means, and trust me, Nickelodeon has made TONS of those. This game is a joy to play and it defined my childhood. I hope you can enjoy it to .
I have a scion tc and I absolutely love this lanyard. It clip just right so nothing falls off the hook .
projector was okay if its all the right spots the only thing that sucks is that the marks it leaves after you applied a screen protector to your phone. it's not clear you can still see the marks and indents of where you try to put it on .
what this for my mother in law and it doesn't fit on right to the screen. The case won't snap on niw because the screen protector .
I bought this for my mother-in-law who just got this cell phone and Iy Didn't fit right. It hangs of the side .
These seat covers were everything I wanted they match my car and it has a leopard print but I put them on and they don't fit my seat right and was told they would and I have to fix them all the time never stay down. insides are falling out and I have only had them for a couple of months .
I got three pieces was spouse to be 12 inches they was and measure 36 inches cost way to much to ship back don't by big lie won't order from amazon again .
Unfortunately, Exposed did not work for my skin. In fact, it made it worse after using it for two months. It made my skin extremely oily and break out more than normal. I did return the product .
This fragrance is super cheap, yet smells great. My son loved it and so do I.  His first fragrance, and will buy again, plus it's name brand. If you haven't smelled, do give it a try. I doubt you'll be disappointed .
Received this on my porch on a Sunday. I was pleasantly surprised. Packaged well. I give three stars only because the 11 inches were very deceiving.  This is the smallest doll my daughter has. It's cute with its little creases and such, but I could have found something at Toys R Us for the same price, and bigger.  Not to say I won't order from them again, I will just have to get a bigger one. My daughter loves it all the same .
WAS ALL SET FOR A DISASTER , BUT... this tablet is awesome. Connects to WiFi with ease. Downloads all the latest games easily and quickly. Response is great. Movies with out lag. For the price, for pre-teen boys, this tablet cannot be beat. Wow, surpasses my expectations .
Got this for my 18 month old daughter.  It's simple and cute. Effective counting with praise for completion. Definite 'gotta get it'  for young children. No pop-ups .
Starts off really cute. Soft and colorful. But after one washing... fades a lot. After two washings even more. The sheets are now see through. Don't get me wrong it hasn't fallen apart or ripped, but the lack of color fastness is enough to make me wish I had bought a different set, and I had bought two. So if you're getting it for a bed that your not going to wash, go ahead. But you might want a little better quality if you have to wash behind toddler boys .
Fits good, no bulk. Loosens up a little, and will slide down. Sure I can fix it . Cute and worth the money .
I probably didn't read as much as I should have. You know, the fine print. I checked the ratings to see if it was appropriate for my kids. To my surprise , all I got was a very slow going story, comic book style. Then an opportunity to buy the full version. Looks to have potential, however without trying it, didn't buy it .
What's not to like . It's like Candy Crush but the graphics are more enticing and appealing. Simple consistent game play. Cute, cute, cute .
My 4 year old and myself love this. Lego games are often complicated. This is perfect for younger kids who love the Lego getup but are to young for the system games. Hope for upgrades or more of the same types of games. No ads .
I enjoyed this book, i literally couldn't put it down. However, it reminds me of a generic brand of 50 shades of grey. It is still a good book and i recommend it to anyone who liked 50 shades of grey .
I could not put it down! The book was good but the only thing I will say is I think Rene fell in love to fast .
Jordy PalloEsta novela es  muy interesante, en sus cap&iacute;tulos nos narra circunstancias que se viven en la actualidad, ademas Santiba&ntilde;ez es un excelente contador de historias, debido a estas caracter&iacute;sticas hace que el lector siga atrapado por el suspenso.Utiliza un lenguaje muy directo, no utiliza tantas figuras literarias lo que hace f&aacute;cil de entender la novela, usando oraciones claras.Pude leer esta obra literaria la pude leer en el taller de lenguaje II y definitivamente la puedo recomendar, ademas podemos entender mejor la literatura ecuatoriana .
I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to provide a safe & secure housing for cats.  it is all the description said it was.  I put it on my front porch.  We had very heavy rain that night.  I checked the inside of the house and it was not wet.  I also bought a self warming pad for the inside ot the house which makes it very warm for the cats .
But I was able to make it work. Sturdy plastic, decent lock. I do wish that the hinges were a bit stronger but no bad .
I received this product two weeks after ordering,what made it so bad was i tracked this item an it was.in my city to only end up in the next state the following day.i was not at all impressed an i would never order from them AGAIN .
I really love this product works perfect with my packge of nike Ipod and sensor 100%recommendable for people who don't get nike sho's .
Get what you pay for. The wires came outta one side and stopped working. not good for hot swapping. but it does the job. if you need something immediately buy this. if not don't bother. fast shipping though .
My daughter has thick hair and I hate the blowdrying process but with rhis product I don't mund and neither does she .
I luv the mommy wigs I have numerous  colors ,they run out of #1fast in the beauty shops.so I order this color online,this my second one from here ,,only reason it's not a 5 because of the way it shrinks when you wash it .
This is the best ever like I mentioned on another review I ordered 3 so far 2gueen&1full..easy and quick assembly my 16 mth old granddaughter helped ,,does not make noise ,,very strong,, but then noticed after I started to order by third one the price had went up tremendously..high in demand now ..I was gonna order more as gifts for others not affordable now..All- in- all still 5 .
This product did nothing ..waste of money,, along with the face cream..should have gotten a refund but didn't I know next time .
I like the tight fit ,my first waist cincher you can definitely see results the first time wearing it,the second day it was a lil looser,,I just ordered another one aswell,both in a large,..prompt delivery had the first one for a week now today 3-30-14 is my third day wearing it ,, the other one is scheduled to arrive 4-1-14 since it's by the same person it should be 4* too,the reason it's not 5* is because of the itchy feeling and marks it leave on you,,I keep it on for atleast 12hrs. as I go about my day .
This is a really great glove for the price. They are definitely not a weather glove, but for warmer weather above 55 degrees, they are perfect. Very comfortable, and I am able to feel the movements of the throttle well with them. Very durable material so far. Will see how they last thru the season .
Have not got a chance to ride long with these. But they were easy to install (used small amount of dish soap), and when I sat on the bike and just played with throttle, it was a lot more padding and felt comfortable. We will see how they hold up to this weekend after a few hours of riding .
The quality of this helmet is awesome, it is well over a $100 helmet at a $50 price. Visor doesn't fog up much or anything, fits well and is comfortable on long rides. Going to buy a tinted visor to go with it .
I bought this bag specifically for using on a motorcycle, will see how it holds up. There is no padding on the actual strap of the sling, but I can easy add some if needed. It will hold my water bottle and some small items and snacks while out for a ride .
I really LOVED this book. And there are several reasons:First, good reading. It s very interesting just to read this book - interesting to follow life and development of writer, to know about unique personal experience of Liu PingSecond, very educational. It shows China from completely different point of view. You see from inside all historical events took place in China thrue the eyes of real reagular people who lived them throe. We (westerners - as we are called in the book) don't have real picture of the country, its culture and people. And book of Liu Ping opens your eyes and make you think different. After this book I decided to read more about China - about it's history - so similar and at the same time so different from RussiaThird, very emotional. This book gives you so much positive enegry, fills you with optimism and desire to live your life and fight for your dreams. It motivates you to work hard and study more to improve your professional skills and make personal growth.So, I would stongly recommend this book to everyone who is interested in world history and looking for insperation. And for all who want to read about unique and motivating life story of success .
A highly known skylander in all of the skylander fans, Trigger Happy is back and better than ever in Series 2. You know, this tech-element skylander will never grow old around the world. He came in the Skylanders Spyro's Adventure starter pack ( along with Spyro and Gill Grunt). He still is rocking with his golden pistols and safes. His pistol and safe path are the same, but he has an awesome wow-pow power now. While using the golden machine gun, press the primary attack to fire out a mega blast.Even if you already have Series 1 Trigger Happy , you should buy this one to ( I'm not crazy people). Overall he is like the best one so far in the tech element ( my opinion). Leave comments or questions on Skylanders Giants .
Chill is a water skylander, which means she can swim in water (unless you can fly over it). Overall, she is very speedy in the game and has a good long range attack throwing a ice spear. Although, her figure is fragile and she dies easily if it is against a bark demon or a arkean sniper. Basic thing is, the spear does everything. If you don't get the spear path, you'd do 14 damage. But if you did, it would do over 20 damage. At first she looked well, bad, but when i found out her catch phrase was "Stay cool" , well that got me. So it might not be that bad if you bought her at least she isn't like drobot. Come one people lightcore is only 12.99 while normal is 9.99. I hope you like my review. Leave any comments or questions about Skylanders Giants. :- .
Is it a yeti or an ice man? No its the fierce yeti of the water element, Slam Bam. Despite not being a giant, Slam Bam is one power house with his four arms. He'll devastate anything in his way. This is one must have skylander in your collection. His upgrades paths; his brawler fighter path, and his ice prison path. Both are very good but when you get to his soul gem, you need to find it in Empire of Ice which in this single character pack, does not come with. So you have to buy another Slam Bam with his adventure pack. Overall, you would still be pleased with him throughout the game. I hoped you liked my review. Leave any comments or questions about Skylanders Giants. :- .
Drobot, the new lightcore character from the tech is not being sold a lot. Why? Well first you can't switch paths, you have to reset it. Anyways, he helps a lot whens its like four Arkeyan Defenders or Axecutioners. His attacks are pretty weak, but his soul gem makes his thrusters damage enemies. Activision really needs to think it again. You know, I thought Activision was going to take a step forward in Skylanders, but didn't. The blasters and bladegear paths don't really make a difference in the character and really I think you can expect more from the giant, Bouncer in this case. I wouldn't say that Drobot is the worst in my conclusion, but that drobot isn't like the rest of the Skylanders. Leave comments or questions on Skylanders Giants. :- .
Another new giant, Bouncer joins the tech element. He has finger pistols kinda like Trigger Happy. He can also fire off rockets from his shoulders. Later in the game, you,ll get an "I-beam" (basicly eye lasers). He is a good skylander for long range attacks and as well for button-masher people. He has a path about futher devoloping his rockets (which I choose) and one for his fingerguns and lasers. Overall , I think Activision needs to go back to the drawing table and make a change because you should expect more more from a giant than this ( please don't sue me Activision). Well there might be a reason why they did this.  Also see my Trigger Happy review for anyone who reads this or just likes to button mash a lot.Leave comments or questions on Skylanders Giants. :- .
I have love hair and with the rollers it really helped the straightener to glide down and perfectly straighten my hair. I like it.  I even use it on my daughters long hair and she doesn't complain one bit. We both would say go ahead any get it ...oh yeah and itcworks better then my other 2 pricier straighteners .
love this book!!! even 20 years later when i can read it to my daughter...the Bernstein bears never disappoint...highly recommend .
love this book...i highly recommend this book for a great exciting story that you do not want to end...onward to book 3 .
It didn't fit in my g&g cm16 raider long. don't buy it if u have a combat machine, or just don't buy it at all .
it is not working  always says error . i was thinking this item will make me happy to check my blood pressure but when i try to use it says error than i was thinking may be battery is weak so i buy another battery and use same error is came , i am give up to check and check again  so i am not try again .
Adapter does not work at all and the connector that goes to the laptop is loose. Also, capacity of adaptor is lower than that ordered .
Accurate, precise, and great weather alerts. Don't need to watchr listen to weather reports any more. Would like to see times and temps listed for a two or three day period instead of scrolling .
Easy to use as well as quick and accurate, this app is great. There are no bugs and it doesn't freeze. Fast to open and close .
This is a thinking person's movie. It is experiential as well as cerebral. I don't know if I'll ever understand all of it and thats ok. It might be intended to be that way.It is hard to imagine how the actors, writers and directors accomplished this.  All deserve high praise. Roger Ebert gave it 4 out of 4 stars and watched it three times, which is exactly what I'm going to do. If not 4 or 5 times .
Love this app. Sometimes the answer is obscure but overall it's a fun game. When you identify the bands, remember what they looked like then, not now .
If you live the life of a digital nomad, like myself, you will find this monitor amazing. I use it with my MacBookPro Retina computer (thunderbolt to displayport) and it works wonderfully. I've owned HP monitors before and never been real impressed with them. This monitor is closer to the DreamColor technology HP sells and is very high quality. I only wish it were just a tad bit lighter as 9lbs is still quite a bit but is not outside the range of easily portable in your suitcase :- .
This product did not work at all. The product looked & smelled like it was very old. The package was sealed when I received it but it looked like it had been sitting so long it started to leak. I will not purchase again .
Was not the movie that you would expect however he should have an oscar for this one, my friend that i got the movie for would rather see balls to the walls JCVD .
I did not know this item was fake until I compared it with my friend's newly purchased one at the mall. It is well copied if you don't care the detail , but you could obviously tell it is fake if you see real one. Material is low quality, voice muffled by case ,A built-in screen protector is bad quality and hard to see, etc.. Not even a well-made copy.  I regret not realizing this sooner .
Tool does exactly as advertized but crankshaft really doesn't need held the only way it can be turned or moved is by hand .
NYC will never be the same after JIM. Three squirrels and a goth chick can change your perspective, and you don't have to be afraid of getting too dark .
Recorded in 2010, you'll find a few familiar rants and toons from his popular web series on this comedy album, but notably this fills in the gaps for the storyline of Germaine's nervous breakdown. I'm glad that JIM keeps it fresh by including Pillz-e and Begley (as I began to miss the squirrel punk Brit ex-pat- think Sid Vicious), in his never-ending NYC cultural/social commentary. He's ballsy as ever telling it like it is whether it's Germaine's weight gain, the state of education, or people walking around zombified from a cocktail of trends and antidepressants. Don't be afraid to DL this if you want to mirthlessly grin... or do be afraid .
I am so excited about having ordered this book....got it, can't put it down! Prepare to have a life changing experience. You owe it to yourself!  Highly recommended. 5 out of 5 stars .
The watch I recieved It's nothIng like the picture, bad quality , very simple and looks very ugly. The material purse Is very cheap .
I received mines this morning. I placed it on my phone and it came off. The adhesive on the glass didn't even stick to my phone at all. It was a waste of my money. If I could get a replacement I would be more than happy. Other than that It was a big disappointment. I was really looking forward to having this on my phone because I heard it is the best protector there is. Also the glass came with scratches .
Definitely worth watching! The wife in this story is in need of some serious help. She doesn't have a clue about marriage and it's give and take. Where is her heart. Good for discussion at the round table .
You wouldn't want to put it down. The story is captivating and gives a true picture of live has so many twists and turns .
It wasn't too long ago when I found about baoding balls, so I was just buying random ones and trying them out.  These are pretty lightweight and come with a beautiful-sounding chime.  They're pretty easy to work with, even for a beginner like me (okay, the tiny ones I had were more difficult to work with than these).  It won't be long until I start working with heavier, or bigger ones.  But I got these, multiples, to work with over time.  The designs on these are really beautiful, and so far they haven't worn out or anything.  I definitely recommend these to the beginners who want to work with something light.  If you don't like listening to chimes, then I suggest you opt out of this one .
I'm the kind of girl who doesn't wear skirts too often, so when I wanted to get one, I wasn't sure what to get.  I'm glad I picked this as one of my first skirts.  A lot of skirts that I've seen around stores are super thin and look like they can break easy.  This one was made of a thicker material.  I guess you can compare it to felt, but I'm 100% sure it's not felt.  It just had that texture to it, and is more stiff than felt actually is.  The skirt is at a fair length on me, a couple inches above the knee.  Maybe for someone of my stature it would be nice to have some shorts under, but otherwise, I thought it was really cute.  I bought the black one, and I wouldn't be surprised if I bought another .
This skirt was very cute.  When I got it, it fit just fine and I didn't have to roll down the waist for good measure.  The material feels very smooth, and the color was a very deep black.  I would have gotten a different color, but I don't buy skirts, so I thought to get something in a more basic color.  The skirt runs a bit shorter than I thought it would, maybe more than a couple of inches above my knees.  I wouldn't wear it out unless I had some shorts underneath, but to dance or do some exercises in, this skirt would be perfect.  I'm definitely going to buy another .
I appreciate that the Stamper/Scraper worked very well.  However, I would appreciate it more if the bottom of the stamper was the translucent white that the picture of the product shows.  I got one with a dark, hot pink bottom.  If I were to use pink or a red-related stamping polish with this stamper, it would be hard for me to work with because it would be difficult to see.  Luckily, I used a white stamping polish with this.  It works really well, easy to get the hang of even if you're a beginner like me.  I think the seller should give us the choice to buy pink or white bottom separately, instead of having a picture different from the product.  That's the only reason why I gave this 4 stars.  Don't let this discourage you from getting it, it's still a well-working product .
I absolutely love this cute case!  Definitely a fan of Rilakkuma and what better way to show that than to have his mug plastered on the back of my iPod?The product itself is a very soft rubber, and it's quite durable.  Not too sure if i can say that for the ears, however, but I always take good care of it.  I use the little black pouch it came with as a screen cleaner just because.I have dropped my iPod in the couple weeks I have owned it, and not a single scratch.  Not even on the case itself.  The impact is completely absorbed in the bouncy case and it still looks amazing afterwards!  The iPod might slip out a little if you're not careful how you're moving it, but otherwise it fits perfectly.If I could get another one JUST TO HAVE I'd get this one again and all its colorful brothers and sisters.  I definitely recommend this .
One of the best books ever!! Slow beginning but sucks you in and then ou don't want to put it down! I ordered 10 for friends for Chistmas!All came from Amazon....great timimng and condition as stated!!Thankyou Amazon .
A really great story to follow the first Christmas Jars! A great read anytime not just at Christmas time!Thankyou .
Ok this really is the best creamy lotion I've  ever used!  Had a freind tell how much she liked it, so decided t find out!I will not use anything else....sweet smelling-one has to remember NOT to take a bite!! :-)Can you tell I really LOVE THIS LOTION ?:- .
Ive been diagnosed with Tarcel Tunnel (feet) and for the last 3 years Ive been wearing TEVAS! THey are the ONLY ANYTHING that works for me!!! I am usually an 8.5 but the arch fits better for me with a 9 (so I have a bit leftover at the toe~I don't mind at all)!! These were/are a GodSend for me when I found them!!!!Thank you very much TEVA~and keep'em coming!!!:- .
I hold Merrell to a high standard for comfort and quality.  I was not disappointed in these sandals.  Highly recommend them .
The quality is excellent, the service exceptional....what's not to like?  Received it sooner than I expected and it looks great .
I always believed in Heaven, but I loved Dr. Neal's story of what it was like and I've had signs that I felt had to be imagined and knowing that she had the same doubts makes me realize that it is possible.  I think she explained things in a 'down to earth' (no pun intended) way that made it hard to put the book down.  It is a book that I highly recommend .
I wanted a &#34;nicer&#34; jacket for winter and came across this one. The price was awesome so I gave it a try. Its a little snug but def not unbearable. Im pretty sure it fits the way its suppose to. It came on time looks great and is acually pretty warm .
I wanted to buy my boyfriend some warm clothes and I came across this sweatshirt. Considering the brand and price I thought it was an awesome deal. He likes it. It came on time, the only thing is there was a tiny hole in the stitching by the shoulder. Super easy fix so no complaints .
Paint chips off easily. Smells gross. I don't recommend them at all. Get a better cover, just not this .
I just got my cover and OHMY! IT'S ADORABLE!!!!!! I LOVE IT! Everything is good although I didn't get the cloth thing but it don't matter :D MUST GET .
Not only does this book give you insight into how hard and dedicated you need to be a SEAL, it also illustrates how selfless a person Adam was. It's made me realise how much more room there is for me to grow as a person .
I'm a software developer and hoped to get some business insight into the how and why the big 4 have developed a "platform". The term "platform" seems to be used quite loosely and there is little insight, interviews or research to back up claims made throughout the book. After reading the first two chapters I did not learn anything new and the rest of the book makes a lot of generalized claims that, as someone with an IT background, makes me cringe .
Wasn't expecting much due to the low reviews but it's a pretty decent movie and worth watching if you're a sci-fi junkie .
The picture in the product description is misleading. The product features a camera, a flashlight and a small bag for the camera, not a pair of binoculars as shown in the product image. Be aware of this before ordering .
LOVE this kit. Its literally just as easy to install as the youtube video. Makes your car look like a spaceship at night, especially if you have a convertible like me. The music function is more like a strobe function to me, but I don't use it anyways. Before I got the kit I wondered if you could change it to any color and pause it, and as a matter of fact you CAN! I was very happy with all of the different modes and options and is surprisingly bright. All of my friends LOVE it and want it in their cars too lol. Best $35 I've spent on my car. I think I'll get the wheel well kit next .
I have bought other cheaper HID kits before on amazon, but I never will again. The kensun HID kit is the clearest, easy to install kit I have ever bought. They have been working for 2 months now with no flickering, or any other issues. Looks like right out of the factory.  Its worth the extra money to buy a good brand like kensun, trust me .
I specifically ordered this firebowl because it was advertized as a 35 inch firebowl. After receiving it in the mail, the bowl only measured 22 inches. It was too late to swap it out because I was having a party that night and couldn't order another in time. That's false advertizing and it needs to be fixed immediately .
i like this case because it is flush to the screen and it does not make the phone noticeably larger .
This case totally lives up to the hype. It fits perfectly of course, and the display works great. There wasn't any interference with answering calls through the display.The only concern is that the back is left unprotected. I loved that the front display is protected if I accidentally drop the phone, but I am concerned about the back and corners. I love the features so I'm not going to switch it out. As a terrorist fix, I used a cheap eBay back protector on it until my flip mate case from spigen comes in. Until then I'm baby-ing my device.SPIGEN SGP Samsung Galaxy S4 Case Flip [Flip Mate] [Crystal Clear] S-View Cover Protector / Samsung Flip Cover Back Protector for Galaxy S IV Galaxy SIV i9500 .
It is everything that I was looking for it to be. It arrived sooner than I thought it would and there was nothing wrong with it what so ever. Not even a dent in the packaging. &#60;&#60;-- Real Person .
I loved this book! I recommend this book for ages 9-14 for young girls. I read other comments saying this book seemed long but actually is the shortest book in the series. i loved it and i can't wait to get the next books .
This flashlight would be great if you could actually recharge it. But the plug sits recessed in a cavity at the back of the light and none of my extension cord will fit into the cavity. Very odd design. Wish I had paid closer attention before purchasing. It is now a paperweight .
Pretty standard romantic comedy. Somewhat predictable plot. However, it's definitely not a bad movie by any means, and is good for an occasional chuckle .
this game rocks but do not change ur name after u have finished the game because it messes it up and u will have to start from the beginning! but I still think this game rocks .
its a great game but ones ur unstoppable it gets spittle boring.so if you haven't bought this game yet don't cause its a waste of money .
I was looking for a stylus that I could also use as a pen, if needed. This little stylus is PERFECT!. Was packaged well, and had no issues with shipping. I would recommend this to anyone!Great product .
I would recommend this product to anyone looking for an anti glare shield. Was packaged well, fit perfectly, and was easy to install. Still have one small bubble that is being persistent. But that's not a fault of the company.Thanks for a great product .
I really love my case. My wife made me a knitted &#34;stocking&#34; for my nook, and I was concerned that after I got this case, I wouldn't be able to use it. But this slim fit case fit perfectly.Really stylish, with the brown and black. Even my kids thought it looked really cool....:-).Great product .
I really love these! They were my first incense I had ever gotten and they were magnificent. I've had them for months and still haven't run out. c .
I really like this case it adds color and flavor. fits the phone nicely. Only down part is that it is hell to take off, so don't put it on unless you plan on leaving it on for a while .
It is to prevent dust from getting into your phone. But i use it for style, and because not too many people know about it so they always ask what it is that is on my phone. really nice product. I suggest it .
The sizes definitely run a bit small. I ordered my normal size small and it fits, but it's definitely tight! I won't return it and I love the shirt! I wear it often :-) but if I ordered another, I will order the next size up .
I love the shirt and wear it often! I always buy shirts in size small so naturally, that is the size I ordered for this shirt. It's a bit tight, in hind sight I would probably order a medium. I like my shirts fitted, but this is just a bit too tight (although not enough for me to return it or chose not to wear it .
This is totally not what I expected, it's better. Really fun if you are into RPGs. If you play LoL or WoW, you might like this. Or if you're just looking for some old-school fun. If you have money to spend, buy this .
It helps with drawing. It really does! My friend had this app and now she can't stop drawing. The only downer is the priced dragons are the best dragons .
Dose Leatherman make anything i that is not of good quality. This sheath is very nice, you can feel the quality. I use it to hold my skeletool. It is just slightly to big for that tool .
Not to happy, the clasp broke after two days. The wallet size is nice, but now I have to keep it closed with a rubber band .
This is a great case. This is my 4th iPhone. I have had the whole gambit of cases. Tough armor offers great protection with a small size. I carry my phone in my front pant pocket. No hang ups and is just slightly bigger that the actual phone .
The item is great but the one thing I didn't like from cable matters that they keep on getting on my nerf .
Ok...not as good as others ive read .
Great book. Couldn't put it down .
Great book... couldn't put it down .
it uses 3 clock bateries - too much. worked only few hours, throw in the trash next day. don't recomend .
product fails two weeks. sent for repair and fails again. would not recomend for anybody. product is no good .
I recommend this product because I have a dog that has very dry skin and she sheds quite excessively. After using this product, my dog's skin and fur was very soft and her shedding was reduced. The product does not lather up well and it's quite greasy, but it helps my dog's skin and fur stay soft .
This product (which is really 3) would cost at least $30 retail or more at a store.I now don't have to worry if I forgot to charge my phone. I have one in my car, at the office and at home .
For some reason the color on this is not true.  Mickey's face is pink as if he has a sunburn.  And it's not a computer monitor issue - the picture on the package looks like normal, but on the blanket itself, he's pink.  Have to return it, just glad I still have time before the birthday party!!The price was right, but the quality was wrong, so I would not recommend this to anyone .
Ratio of US to World favored US too much.  World maps did not always have the detail I would have liked.  Overall, the information basicly was more than adequate.  Good job on that part .
This film provides much information about the people who established the background for the ideals from which the Declaration of Independance and the Constitution of the United States were written.  It makes it clear that many U.S. Supreme Court rulings in the last fifty years are based on PERSONAL FEELINGS of the Supreme Court Judges, not on the precepts of the U. S. Constitution .
Not only is it so very cute but it actually protects my phone. I drop my phone so many times a day  and this help to protect it! And i get a least 10 compliments a day .
We love it!  We didn't received the extras that were promised to be in it, but we are enjoying watching the show.  We didn't recieve the postcard autographed by Jonathan Frid.  We received all the disks and the episode guide .
this book i started reading a week ago and loved the sample its like i couldn't put the book down i stayed up till 1 am just because i was so key on finishing it. this book is amazing for tweens in my opinion .
I gave this book a three because it wasn't very long and it was 4 dollars .I think it should be a novel .
I ordered 2 chargers among 9 other items from Amazon from different sellers, the charges were the last items that i recieved and there was no any way to track the shippment as this option was not available by the seller. then upon finally recieving the 2 chargers I found that one of them is faulty :(.. so disappointing indeed .
a disappointing product, although it looks beautiful in the picture but my first impression when i received it that it bulky. i didn't pay much attention to that and tried to get used to its size but the disaster that within 8 months the watch stopped working and it appeared that its mechanical parts are not working properly. this is a first time for me to face this with any watch not to mention a branded one .
I've had this toaster oven for about 6 mos. There's just two of us to cook for, so I use it quite often. I love the convection oven. Cooks things much faster and also browns them at the same time. Great for crispy potatoes. All four functions work well and love that you can remove the bottom pan to clean it. I've read in other reviews the complaints about the outside of the oven getting hot. I've never had a toaster oven that didn't get hot on the outside. And yes, the beeper is loud, but comes in handy if you're in another part of the house while something's cooking and you want to hear it when it's done. We've used the oven 4 or 5 times a week since we got it and haven't had any problems. We're very pleased with this product .
Most of it is very readable and interesting to readers that are not specialists in the field.  There are a few essays that is obviously only written for people who understand the relevant field of expertise.  Love the concept and layout .
Kind of a quick read but a great book. Love how the story line is going and I  cannot wait  for the next book .
I absolutely love this show and it seems to get better and better each season. I can't wait to see how things develop .
It does "Work" as stated, and I would have given it a 5 star rating, but the sling swivel kit needs to come with not just the long wood/plastic screw base mount, but needs to also include a shorter base mount wood/plastic screw.  I had to customize/shorten the long base screw that's used for wood/plastic stocks, so it would fit my pistol grip folding stock, but the sling kit mounts do give a strong anchor point for your sling , and they look good when installed, and it functions great with my condor brand name sling.JM .
Just received my Wright Pre-filled Syringe Carrying Case - Pack 2, and I must say it's a good idea, but the carrying case needs to be about a 1/8" longer to hold my syringe, which is filled with 50 units of insulin.  In the information, listed in fine print it does state that the case will hold up to 49 units, but the most insulin I could get into my syringe, and be able to fit inside the case was 48 units of insulin, again it's a good idea, but the case should be about an 1/8" longer to accommodate a full 50 unit syringe, again the information states that it fits my size syringe, and it does, but it will not accommodate the full length of my syringe when filled with insulin to it's full 50 units capacity, the case will only accommodate a syringe with up to 48 units of insulin.  I am thinking about drilling a small hole in the end of the carrying case, which then would allow me to fill my syringe to the full 50 units of insulin I need. I do recommend this Pre-filled Syringe Carrying Case, but it does need to be about 1/8" longer, so I can only give it a (3* Rating).Note: Update - I was using a BD 1/2 cc syringe which at full capacity holds 50 units of insulin, and it would not fit the case it was too long when full, so I upgraded to the next larger diameter syringe, a BD 1 cc capacity, and it holds my full 50 unites of insulin, and fit's the pen case without any problem. "Syringe fit Problem Solved .
The Seller did properly describe the trap set tool, as for it's intended use, but it is worthless when trying to set the strong heaver body grip traps like the Duke #280, #330 etc., this devise does work for smaller traps like the Duke #110, but you can set this trap with your hands, so the tool is not needed, in my opinion this tool is near being worthless to use on large body grip traps, for which it was advertised to set, again it does work to set the small, maybe to medium size traps, but again, I just don't trust it for setting larger traps like the Duke #280, or #330 sizes, my reason for thinking this is that the handles on this set tool are to short, and you can't get enough leverage to easily, or safely set the large traps (the tool only measures 20 inches long), and too, I don't trust the small pivot bolt that connects each half of the tools steel handles together, it does not appear to be made of case hardened steel, and under heavy pressure I think it might break, and may cause injury to the user, but it's just my opinion, and other peoples opinions may differ.  The price was right, but in my opinion the tool is almost worthless to set large traps, and again, just not sure about the safety aspect, or quality issues of this tool.  "You Will Have To Use Your Own Judgement", as too, if you should Purchase This Tool .
This knife sharpener will sharpen your knife, but you must be really careful as not to have an accident, and cut the hand (fingers) that hold the body of the knife sharpener, if not super careful it would be easy for the sharpener to slip in your fingers, and cause a painful cut to your hand, or fingers.  Again the knife sharpener will sharpen your knife, but just use caution as to finger placement while sharpening your knife.  Final Note:  &#34;This Knife Sharpener Will Sharpen Your Knife&#34 .
Just received my Recovery Strap, and happy to say that I'm pleased with it, the recover strap appears to be made of high quality materials, and even though I've not had an opertunity to use it yet, In a emergency I do believe it will do it's intended job well, so I give it a (5* Rating .
This propane hose for a Mr. Heater "Buddy portable Heater" is "A Must Have Item" for use in long term without heat emergencies, or several days use while camping in cold weather. "This Model # F273704 States That It Does Not Require A Fuel Filter", like other hoses do. I recommend This Hose Assembly" but not the "Seller/Shipper I purchased it from, "Very Slow Shipping .
For the money paid I guess this Cleaning kit is OK, but the wooden box it come with is not of high quality, (crooked rear mounted hinge, and smeared stain, or paint on the top lid, also the kit I received states 42 pieces, and not 35 pieces as the sellers ad stated, so I guess it depends on how they count the included items in this kit, again the gun cleaning kit is OK, but nothing special, not of high quality, but for the money I guess it's an OK kit .
"Pleasant surprise", the folding shovel blade is made using strong carbon steel materials, with strong welds, and not cheap rivets, The little shovel should be able to take a fair amount abuse, I think it should hold up well, I give this product, and the "Seller" a (5* rating .
Very pleased with this cell phone battery, can't beat the quality, nor the price, it's a (5* best buy for sure .
"It's Always Better To Be Safe, Than It Is To Be Sorry", So Don't Risk Your Life, Or The Lives Of Your Loved Ones, This "Portable Battery Operated Carbon Monoxide Digital Meter" Will Give You That Added Peace Of Mind, And safety On Those Cold Nights, Whether Your Heating With Wood Burning Products, Natural Gas, or LP Gas Sources.

Nice Sling, it seems to be heavy duty, and I would have given it 5 stars, but it may be to adjustable, meaning I don't know if the heavy duty plastic disconnect buckles are really a &#34;Plus&#34;, but again the sling does appear to be made of heavy duty materials.JM .
For the money this belt is probably a good buy, but certainly not anything special, but it does hold the 12 ga. shotgun shells tightly, and it will fit up to a 48&#34; inch waist size, so &#34;It's An OK Shotgun Belt&#34; that for the money that I would recommend !JM .
I already have this cell phone, and just purchased this one for a back-up because the monthly insurance fee for my cell phone was just too much, and by buying this phone as a back-up it will save me lot's of money in the long run.  &#34;I do recommend this cell phone&#34; if you need a solid performer that says &#34;Hello&#34;, and &#34;Yes&#34; it gives you all the other bells & whistles  too, but not the over priced price tag that you would pay at the cell phone service/provider company !JM .
Hi,I ordered this cell phone case to replace the one I had, which was of the same brand name, I accidently dropped my smart phone, and it hit the asphalt paving in a parking lot, but I was so very pleasantly surprised that all that was damaged/broken was the heavy plastic belt clip on the cell phone case, and nothing else, &#34;The Armor Heavy Rubber Case Saved My Cell Phone, Not A Scratch&#34;,  so that is why I am recommending this rugged case, &#34;It Really Does Protect Your Phone&#34;.  I give it a (5* Rating) !JM .
I like this emergency solar/hand crank charge latern, it's not big, but for it's size it gives out a good light source for emergency light situations, and your kids will love it for camping.  Good Buy For The Money $14.95 S/H Included .
Ordered at the end of Dec. and was to receive it by the 21st of Jan. and I never received it! Would like my money back and will never order from them again. I hope Amazon bans them from selling on there site. RIP-OFF .
Cannot beat this for the price! I use this all the time on my UDS and it work perfect. I set the temperature and forget it. Highly recommended .
It was not easy to read, it had a lot of scientific theory's and words that I was. Not familiar with and I think it would be better for people who have a background in science .
This book has some great points, the only thing I don't like is when books have you read only a chapter a day, somehow on books like this I get distracted half way through. I will continue to read it. One great thing I do like is that is has a scripture for each chapter .
Love this book! Changed my whole way of thinking about dieting and food.  It's easy to follow because it's not a diet, pretty much a great reminder to use common sense but sometimes we need that. Like a light bulb moment .
An interesting read. Definitely one and done for me. Leaf is the most messed up protagonist I had the pleasure of reading about, through his &#34;God's Eyes&#34;. So, it was comical at times, strange mostly, and to be honest, I bought this book because Satan Burger is something I would have come up with for the title. So I connected on that level. Many times it was just strange as hell and gave me weird feelings b.c it's just such a strange story. The images this book puts in your mind is pretty gross. Definitely funny and I won't ruin it for you, but personally the ending made my skin crawl and the very end was just oddly strange and left me feeling like man, I'm sorta uneasy right now. Weird, I know. Sorta left me wanting more, but it definitely ends... So, for that, this book offered an interesting experience b.c it makes you jump out of your skin. Nothing about this book is normal and based on that, I liked it .
1. Awesome Product for the price. Strong and perfect for those deep knots all athletes will have. Seriously, if you don't think this is strong and doesn't work out the knots around your body, you're either using it wrong, somehow, or you need to get yourself a PVC pipe. Enough Said.2. Unfortunately you may have one side sawed off.  I used a finishing spray on the end so that it doesn't degrade. Works pretty well and no stray foam is fallen off and I've used it a handful of times. So, pretty lame, but it's not falling apart at all.Big turn off, I have to say about it being cut. However, this is an excellent product for the price and works extremely well. Try finding another high density foam roller for this price. I actually did AT MY GROCERY STORE???. Idk how that happened, but i found it there days after I purchased this and it was 100% intact. I kicked myself in the ass for that one. But oh well. This is a Great product and I have zero complaints besides that.**You may read on here that it's not that hard, but trust me, I've been rolling for a year now, and this roller is the next best thing to a PVC pipe. It's a great price and is very strong. I weigh 165 - 170lbs, can stand on top of this roller and it gives very very slightly, obviously, it's foam, but it's not going to fail you and indent after heavy use .
Perfect for what I needed. Even if I was going to wear it, it would have been great. I actually needed it for a present to put on a stuffed animal, so I have zero complaints. Not sure how long the clear rubber wire would hold up if you're trying to wear this thing around, but it seems stretchy and for the price, you can't beat it. Good luck finding this around your neighborhood. You guys rock for having this .
Item delivered on time and well packaged, slip case a bit worn. Essential Diana Rigg episodes from 1965 in B&W. It's called '65 DVD Set 2 (in case you get as confused as I do with the chronology nomenclature). Volumes 3 & 4. Vol 3: The Murder Market, A Surfeit of H2O, The Hour That Never Was. Vol 4: Dial a Deadly Number, Man-eater of Surrey Green, Two's a Crowd, and bonus episode Too Many Christmas Trees .
Well packaged and arrived on time. While not my favorite Avengers episodes, the Cathy Gale series was necessary to complete my collection. It also helps to watch the progression the series made and confirm the pivotal role Macnee made his own so elegantly .
The delivery was on time, well packaged, and met the description parameters. However, I had hoped it would be a little more substantial. Very light and thin metal, and very cheap looking. It looks like something you would find in a Dollar Store. Definitely not worth the price and I do not recommend it .
Basically, nothing really great to point out, other than a heavy base so larger, heavier cans don't tip it. Other than that, a basic can opener that seems solid and durable (so far .
Light weight and easy to hang, these sconces are a welcome change from plain old pictures. I actually hung mine on either side of a framed picture and it completed the wall. Only drawback is the undersized candles they include that don't lie flat and centered in the glass holders. I am actually searching for replacement candles and/or glasses for it. It would be nice maybe if it was stained glass. Still, it was a good deal for the price and I am satisfied .
If you have ever owned a pen-lite like the ones we used to keep on our key chains, this is exactly what you get here. It may be a bit longer, but does not put out any more light than that. I purchased it to put over my laptop for a little additional keyboard illumination, and it was essentially useless. I hung it just a little over 12 inches above the keyboard and found that I might as well keep it off for all the good it does. Also, I had to scotch tape the light in its base otherwise it just falls out. This should be a novelty in a dollar store, nothing more. WAY over priced. I can not recommend this product at all. The fact that the batteries don't last very long either is a mute point since I don't bother to use it any more .
This is good ONLY for light jobs. Anything remotely tough, and it will fail. Not worth the price in that regard alone. Otherwise, for light jobs it is okay .
This unit performed well. No problem leaving it plugged in so far, although I unplug it when I leave the house because of the reviews I read, and indeed it even states in the instructions to unplug when not in use. The toast setting is sensitive, so it may be difficult to get very lightly toasted bread if that is what you like. I like my breads actually TOASTED, so setting it at the lightest it comes out perfect for me. Cleaning crumbs is easy with the pull out tray. All in all, it is more utilitarian than a standard toaster, as it bakes and broils foods as well. Except for the auto off for toasting cycles, there is no timer or auto off for baking or broiling. I just set my microwave timer .
I don't have personal experience with it, but received no complaints, and the person I gifted said she liked it. It does make a nice, quick, and thoughtful gift for teen girls when you need something .
There is nothing like a good &#34;who done it&#34; to while away a lazy afternoon. Of course there can be no comparison to one written by the estimable Agatha Christie and acted by the sublime David Suchet. Watching these mysteries in Blu-ray is icing for the little grey cells Mon Amie. Top that off with the beautiful art deco sets and period costumes, and all you want to do is kick back with a soothing cup of teasan and watch episode after episode. Highly recommended....enjoy .
I think a majority of the bad reviews I read about these cartridges not fitting may have to do with the model you are fitting them into. I noticed hardly any reviews included the model #. Well, here is mine: MFC-J825DW. I have installed only one black cartridge so far. I will update review to include any subsequent pertinent info. First, the package arrived with only one damaged leaking cartridge, a red one. Next, the plastic film covering the inkjet hole is very hard to remove easily without patience and a small sharp tool. Installation was easy enough, and after just one blank page, it printed well and normally. Bottom line, for the price of just one manufacturer approved replacement cartridge, you get 10. If only 2 of the cartridges work for you, you made your money back. I think the great price is due to these few obstacles. So....&#34;ya spin da wheel, an ya take ya chances&#34 .
Interface not so easy, and the load time is slow as molasses. Other than that, it works fine and the price was decent. Can't report on the 3D functionality since I don't have devices for that yet, but nice to know it has it when I am ready to go that route. Slim, light, looks good. Recommended .
This case was crap it was really lose and then. The pieces fell apart in the box Don't buy it. They forced me to give it a star.. smh .
I have never had an issue with screen protectors before, but these are pretty crappy. The first day I had one on my phone, it had scratches all over it. Progressively they got worse and it got to looking really ugly. My second one was impossible to get bubbles out of. I was very disappointed in these and I would suggest you look with another seller .
EVERYBODY WANTS ONE! EVEN IF THEY ARE NOT A STEELER FAN...IT'S THE PERFECT LEI FOR A LOCAL IN HAWAII NEI .
Not the size I was expecting, it is meant for a child not an adult, dimensions on the site would have been helpful .
Great insight on when Faith no more was the strongest and most entertaining.  The videos are vintage and show the band at different stages .
The best horror/mystery book I have ever read! I couldn't put it down! I suggest everyone read this if they're look for a good scare. Stephen King don't stand a chance now .
it sucked. I didn't get the case i ordered. instead I got two, extremely cheaply made cases. i do not recommend .
My husband has diabetes and a size 13 foot but the diabetic socks are so loose. He looks for socks that aren't too tight around the ankle. I had bought Hanes that were thicker in the foot but they also ended up tighter on the ankle.  He seems to like these just fine. I will most likely buy them again .
Used these for deep sea fishing in cabo Mexico found the lenses to be very flimsy but the glare was greatly reduced for the price they are great not worried about dropping them or anything like that .
This thing looks great large graphic not just a sticker on a price of metal the image is clear coated over for a shinny finish. The pin is large but it symbolizes trust and companionship that will come in handy for anyone who loves the movie and will understand the significance. The seller was great it came within days of purchase the item comes with a card that says the Ellie badge the highest honor I can bestow on the front and a picture of Ellie and mr fredrickson on the back great touches and adds to the presentation of the peice overall an amazing product with a lot of meaning and was shipped very fast. Very satisfied overall .
Although this is a very pretty little dress the quality is very poor!  After one ware the cheap fabric frayed, snagged and showed signs of distress.  I washed it on gentle cycle in a lingerie bag and dried on gentle cycle, and it fell apart.  Many parts of this outfit is glued and not sewn together.  As the glue melted in the drier it stuck to different parts of the dress leaving glue spots everywhere.  I would NOT recommend this product nor purchase from this company again .
LOVE Them! Have not worn yet......too cold in MT. Right now........but perfect fit! Exactly what I thought I was getting ! I reviewed sizing per previous customers......therefore I ordered an XL......I am 5'5&#34; and 154#. Hope that helps with your sizing choice .
Beware. Don't make the Fujistu mistake I did. I now own $2,500 worth of Fujistu-scanner-bricks.Fujitsu sells these expensive business-class scanners, then fails to update drivers for new versions of Windows.  When this happens, your scanner hardware will work fine, but your computer won't recognize it. I guess for a few hundred bucks I could live with this, but when prices get north of $1,000, I feel cheated.Buy this machine, and you may well be shopping for a new scanner before you've depreciated the first one .
I bought and liked two similar Fujitsu scanners, about $2,500 worth, and used them in my business. They worked fine. Then Windows updated from XP, and Fujitsu has not updated drivers for either of these devices for any newer system.I now own $2,500 worth of plastic Fujitsu bricks.So, buy a Fujistu scanner if you must--and be sure you get all your scanning in before MS comes out with a new version of Windows .

I can't wait to go to the next book. So many questions have been answered and so many more have been raised .
This was a good read and left  me with plenty to think about. I enjoyed the book but felt the sadistic treatment of the orphans and future pilot was not consistent with the story.  It seemed to be a little too  extreme and unbelievable .
It would have been nice to know it was a very short story. For the price of two dollars and ninety nine cents I could have bought a real book. Fifteen minutes of reading was not worth it .
DID NOT EVEN SEND A BUFFING PAD WITH POLISHER TOO USE?NOTHING???? SO WHEN YOU SELL THIS PRODUCT YOU SHOULD AT LEAT HAVE SOME KIND OF BUFFING ATTACHMENT SO YOU CAN AT LEAST TRY OUT THE POLISHER .
We loved the movie.  However, the sequel after the movie &#34;stuck&#34; so had to turn off.  We have not viewed all the other movies yet. Thanks .
DID NOT BUY THIS ITEAM MY HUSBAND JUST WANTED ALL BLACK BUT OTHER ONE WAS GREAT. HE LOVES IT!!! GREAT BUY .
saves you from having to replace lures, this retriever works so well it has paid for itself several times. it never leaves my tackle box and I take it every time I go fishing .
This is the movie I remember seeing for the first time in Chicago as a young man at the Saturday morning Matinee.Thanks for early Delivery...wasn't expecting it so soon but I'm SATISFIED .
This is a surprisingly well made and warm shoe.Never owned a pair of 574's til now,I'm sure I'll get another pair soon .
There is absolutely nothing foreseeably wrong with this product.I have been pleasantly pleased with the extra sense of security the Otterbox Defender provides.Speaker performance is in no way hindered,in fact..it seems to have added amplified sound to my phone....Thank you Otterbox Techs .
These are OK.  The way they are packaged causes some of them to not lay flat which sometimes makes them appear cheap looking, but this probably cannot be avoided without more costly packaging.  That is my only negative comment.  They are good for what they're used for - disposable .
The day after putting my phone inside this case i started having issues. The case causes the phone to overheat and causes permanent damage to the phone. My phone crashed once, I was not positive if it was the OtterBox so i put the phone back in the case after paying to have my phone fixed. My phone then crashed a second time. I returned to the cell phone repair center and they fixed it again. I did not put the phone back in the case this time and it has worked great ever since until about 20 minutes ago i placed my phone back in the case and within half an hour it has crashed a third time. The damage at this point i don't think is fixable and i will be forced to purchase a new phone soon. Never again will i purchase a product from OtterBox .
this comforter isn't a good match for a toddler because it isn't very long. but it is soft and warm .
Very cute but you can't put the lids on them AT ALL! Let alone with a drink inside of it. Unusable .
It wasn't very comfortable. It felt like it was cutting into my side at one point. Also it wouldn't stay in one place .
Apparently everyone who wrote a review received a different product, some got knock off xbox controllers, I myself recieved a very poor knock off of a PlayStation controller. You know its bad when its not even a knock off of the product you were trying to purchase. Terrible dead zones, weird drivers, etc. This was a poor and stupid purchase made at the last second. Don't make my mistake!Sending it back as soon as I can, I'll spend the extra money to get an official one .
I love this screen protector, i didn't think it would be so efficient, I thought it was going to be a temporary one but it is not and I am really satisfied with it, Thank you very much .
It's not what I remember as a kid. It actually creeps me out more now, but it's not a bad movie .
This book is wonderfully addicting even the second time around. I couldn't put down. I found myself wishing it wouldn't come to an end .
I loved this book. I couldn't stop reading it. It didn't really scare me, but I found it interesting. The author was a very good story teller, and his accounts were remarkable .
I loved Edwin's book True Haunting, so this wasn't much of a risk. The storie's were very clever. I enjoyed this book .
I could watch this movie again and again! It never gets old. I hope my children will love it as much as I did when I was younger..and still do .
Not much information .  Nothing I didn't already know .
Nothing I didn't already know. I didn't find it very scary or interesting. Glad I didn't waste much money .
they are not bad at all....they last a week and work wonderfully i would definitly recommend these to other people for use .
i have tried this gel before....it works wonderssss!!!! and i mean wonders but this time may be since the shipping company was different...it has not been working at all i still some roaches and now i have 4 tubes that won't work...i would recommend it to  any one but may be when buying it, try to getit  SHIPPED from another manufacturer not this one .
it works like a CHARM!!! love it all the raoches are gone and i only had 2 tubes to work with and still in a NYC apartment...NO roaches at all anywhere...i would recommend this to anyone for use .
i got my daughter a teething necklace that was suppose to be safe & for babies. she ended up fraying the string and getting tangled up in itaround her neck. it was difficult to cut of. (she is safe and okay) but i don't want that to happen to any other baby please pass on .
Can't believe the price.. Works great on our dog that has dermatitis. I have bought all kinds of shampoo nothing works better .
Writing quality is great, but I've been through two refills in just a few months, and I don't write that much .
Liked the design, but the stitching and sizing is horrible.. We will take it our tailor to try to make it work, but will not make a purchase again .
TOO big, horrible stitching, seem stitched up rear and front center crouch.. terrible for spandex.. Would never ever purchase from this dealer again ever.. looked nothing like the picture .
Horrible total disappointment, bad material, bad sewing, and just plan horrible will never never make another order from them again.  bad bad bad  hate it .
Skip over the first 30-50 pages. It really doesn't have much to do with the rest of the story. Start when she first gets to her new job. Tha't where it gets good .
This is one book that stays with you long after you finish reading it. I have never, and I mean NEVER cried so hard reading a book. I loved this book and recommend it to anyone who loves a love story .
Bec Botefuhr is an amazing author. I've read almost all of her books and haven't been disappointed yet. Three hearts One Soul is sweet, sexy and at times heart wrenching.I highly recommend this book if you like to laugh, cry and swoon while reading .
I really enjoyed this book. It was funny as hell and surprisingly sweet. I might've even shed a tear or two.It wasn't the same old kidnapping book, this one was special, because I liked it and the characters weren't boring or always trying to hide their feelings from each other. It was action-packed with death-threats and sexual tension. It doesn't get much better than that .
I loved the character development, you really get a feel for their emotions. This book takes you on quite a journey and I didn't want it to end. I laughed and I cried and along with the amazing storyline, this is a 5 star book. PLUS, ITS FREE .
So many good suggestions and the book is well organized. Have gotten some excellent skin care advice and feel as if my skin IS looking better. Like the fact that the suggestions don't cost an arm and a leg but really target what is useful. Plus great diet and exercise suggestions! Respect Dr. Oz and am thankful to all the women who worked hard to bring this book about. Thank YOU .
I truly recommend this CD to anyone!!! These two gentlemen rock on this CD. Just watch this and you will understand my point of view. I hope they make another one for me to buy!! Can't wait for it .
I truly believe that this tv show is just one of the best in tv. I can't wait to see the next few seasons. Thank you for putting this on the website .
I expected just a little bit more of this movie. I found it to much exaggeration. None the less, ok to watch. enjoy it .
I bought this item about a month ago because I was in desperate need of installing an easy access light switch going into my garage. So far this item works great and was fairly easy to install if your handy with a drill and screwdriver to mount the switch on a wall. For me this item is only intended to be temporarily until I can find an electrician to hardwire and install better lighting. I would highly recommend this product to anyone who is looking to easily install a wall switch for lights or other electronics. I would have given this 5 stars but I'm not sure of the battery or long term life of this product though .
For the money I think this is really good hardware for my intended purpose. I bought this hardware pack so I could setup a practice kit in my spare bedroom since all my other high end hardware is utilized on other kits. I have to admit it's quite basic and fairly lightweight, but it serves it's intended purpose well. Even the kick pedal has descent action after I got it dialed in and put a better beater on it. I wouldn't recommend this hardware to anyone who does a lot of gigging because I don't think it would hold up to all the rigors of constant setup and teardown. I would spend the extra bucks on something more high end for gigging drummers. If you're just looking for stands for a rehearsal or a beginner kit, than I highly recommend this hardware pack .
I originally bought 2 of these as Christmas gifts for my parents based on the most favorable reviews of any pillows I read. My parents totally loved them so I decided to purchase 2 more of them for myself. I have to admit that they these are not your typical idea of what you think a pillow would be. They are actually kind of heavy. After a few nights of getting used to them, I ended up really liking them. They are firm which I like in a pillow and they hold their shape really well. I find that I don't toss and turn nearly as much causing me to have a better nights sleep. In conclusion, I would recommend these pillows to anyone who is currently unhappy with their current pillows and willing to try something unconventional .
This is the best new cd I have bought in a long time. I don't buy new music very often because I rarely hear anything that captures my attention until this band came along. I discovered them by accident on YouTube. These guys are excellent song writers and have amazing vocal harmonies. I think anyone who is Beatles fan will truly appreciate what these guys do. I have no idea why they aren't more famous. I look forward to hearing more from them in the future. My only complaint of the cd is the lyrics aren't in it .
It is the real thing, not a toy like so many others of its kind.the price was very good as well .
I was so excited when this book was finally available. I had been reading about it's development and could hardly wait to get my hands on it. It did not disappoint. I could hardly stand to put it down. This book is Spirit lead and Spirit filled.I learned a lot that I did not yet know. Slowly I am getting braver about putting it into practice. Thank Praying Medic for the prayer, time, effort and love into this book. Can't wait for your next one. Katherine Beak .
I couldn't  get enough of this book. I learned so much that I really didn't know before. My eyes are opening wider all the time. I' m sure I will refer back to it often and recommend it to others .
I learned so very much from reading this book. I really did not understand all that speaking in tongues was about.I now have a way better understanding of the subject. I am putting into practice what I learned. Prune it all away Lord and fill me with agape love .
I can't get enough of Jason Uptons music. His music transports me to heaven. Love to listen and worship. Holyness .
It works perfectly.  In fact I would not be able to type this right now without it.  The 90 degree angle on the cord works well as the wall outlet is usually behind you .
Very poor quality. Arrived broken. Doesn't look solid at all. Would not order again. Even if it wasn't broken still looks cheap quality and feels cheap .
The book and dust cover arrived in perfect condition with no creases or tears. Mint condition, first edition, perfect!Many people didn't care for the Goblet of Fire, but I can't understand why that is. It's longer which is a plus for me as I love my Harry Potter fix. It delved into the everyday lives, struggles, and thought processes of the characters and studied them more which was very interesting, entertaining and fun. It also kept building up to a year's end which was epic in every way imaginable.J.K. Rowling is a master with twist endings and misleading her readers to think they know everything that's going on the school of Hogwarts, only to school them in just how powerful magic is and what can happen when that power is put in the wrong hands. If you're a fan of the first three books, keep reading. It only gets better from here on .
It wasn't stiff at all the first few rolls which is a problem with a lot of rollers. The paper fits absolutely perfectly, and it rolls my cigarettes to the perfect size (as thick as store-bought cigs, not thin like Misty's). It's very sturdy, and I've had no problems since my purchase. This is the roller to get my friend .
What can I say? It's an amazon gift card, and amazon is better than any physical store, so why get a gift card that's limited to a specific building when the possibilities are endless with a gift card for one of the largest (if not the largest) shops online .
I had my HTC Incredible 2 for a year now, and after it stopped charging or turning on I opened up the back to find corrosion where the stock battery and phone was connected! I cleaned up the corrosion and went looking for a new battery.This product fit all my needs for a good price, so I placed my order. Delivery was fast and arrived on the exact date it stated, the packaging was compact, the instruction manual was short and simple while telling me everything I needed to know, and it came with a warranty card should I want to activate it. I put the battery in, let my phone charge for about 10 minutes before turning it on, and it was at 85%, so I'm guessing it was pre-charged some. It didn't take long at all to get a full charge which I liked since my old battery even in it's newer days took a lot longer to get that 15%.Overall, great quality, exactly what I was looking for, amazing price, and speedy delivery. If you have a phone that needs this type of battery, get this one. You won't regret it .
Loved it,very clear and concise.I actually read it 20 years ago,but ,I didn't own a sextant then.It makes a lot more sense now.Thank you .
This game sucks. It's got a similar set up to Mario but the controls are awful. Half the time when u go to jump you'll just stop moving and fall straight down. Sometimes you can correct and other times you just die. Whoever likes this game obviously is delusional or hasn't actually played Mario or is making there review based on a very young child playing the game. I hate this game and my 6yr old won't even play it. It does work though but if your expectations are very high you won't like it at all .
So here's a REAL  REVIEW. This app does work, there are alot of people complaining about a good app.The Good:  So basically they've got Over a Dozen of there popular shows like Scandal, neighbors, Once. Plus several News programs, both Today shows, 20/20, what would U do &amp; More. For a total of 25 or 30 different programs, maybe more. There are the latest 5 episodes of each able to use watched.The shows clarity depends on your internet speed and your tablet or computer. So the people complaining about it are just cheap. It will stream as good as Netflix or YouTube.Commercials:  Yes you have to watch them but there is one at the beginning of the show and Maybe 2or3 throughout.  You pay $30-100 for cable and have to watch several commercials every 7 mins. This is FREE and there are like 20 less commercials to watch per show. When I was watching nightline there was only one at the beginning.THE  BAD:  I've watched five shows with no problem but one time it did freeze on me. Another time there was a short delay at the very first show I watched there was a 15 or 20 second delay before it startedMY CONCLUSION:  Great Free App , I would pay for it knowing it's this good. I would highly recommend getting. I have a kindle fire HD 7&quot;  I can't guarantee it works with all devices but it sure is worth a shot.  I have gotten other &quot;so-called&quot; tv apps and they didn't let you watch anything. This is different,  download it and you will be happy you did. Then like my comment for giving you such a great suggestion .
Great tool for taking temp readings while staying safe with motors running. I have used it on everything from radiators, AC units to engine parts. A bonus was it came with the battery so I didn't have to scrounge around for one or worse yet make a special trip to the store for it .
Adorable costume, I did taylor it for a custom fit.  The shoes pictured are not what it came with, it had the white overlay triangular piece.  But we didn't use them none the less .
I thought it was candy, didn't read the description I guess, It was plastic.  Must read it better next time .
Beautiful love story demonstrating the trouble with gender. Love knows no boundries. The ego divides and separates, but love unites and heals .
Can't complain at all since the case was entirely free. It is nice and slim and fits the phone great .
I can definitely recommend Fall For Me with all 5 stars!  The characters really got inside my head, and I found myself thinking about them constantly throughout the day. I couldn't wait for work to finish so I could keep reading. I had to sneak in pages between emails and meetings. The writing is very descriptive, and throughout the story I could picture each scene like I was right there with the characters.  And the twist! Wow, what a twist! If you like your angels and vampires, Fall For Me is a ripper book for readers of all ages. Please write the next one fast .
The cover broke as soon as I put it on. It was only a few dollars so I didn't lose much but it is the whole principle .
I wish that we had known about Autism and Aspergers back when I was growing up and I sure wish we had this book. Living Independently is well written and although an easy read Lynne in no way talks 'down' to anyone. I have re-read some parts of this book only because I wanted to commit them to memory. I am very much looking forward to Lynne's next endeavor .
I was really excited for the wire. It arrived on time but it did not work even with batteries.  I was pretty disappointed but the return process was easy .
These are so cute and arrived on time! Even earlier ! Only downside is that the one size fits all is not true. I'm pretty short and the cats face sits below my knees. Still so cute .
The Harbinger is a must read for anyone who loves America. It is the most amazing book besides the Bible that I have read. To see how God performs miracles in our life that we are not even aware of. All I can say is, To God Be The Glory .
I jus tried these baby's out n im not gunna lie its by far the best pick ive played! Id recomend this to all bass guitarist .
These corks work just as advertised.  Easy to put in and easy to remove.  They don't leak when the bottle is lying down .
Don't buy This product it is flimsy  and breakes before ya know it  invest in a better one not triangle world PRODUCTS EITHER THEY WONT EVEN ANSWER YA .DONT KNOW IF I'LL EVER BUY ANYTHING FROM AMAZON AGAIN  Ac Power Adapter for Acer Aspire One Liteon Pa-1300-04 Zg5 Ac Adapter Zg-5 .
I BOUGHT IT AND IT WAS DEFECTIVE AND THEY REPLACED IT THE FIRST TIME ,THEY WERE POLITE BUT THE NEXT ONE  I RECIEVED AS A REPLACEMENT THE CORD WAS BAD AND WAS SPARKING AT THE WALL MELTED MY PLUGIN  I WROTE THEM AND THEY DIDNT EVEN ANSWER  WONT BE SHOPPING FROM TRIANGLE WORLD ANYMORE AS WELL AS AMAZON. CUSTOMER SATISFACTION DOES'NT MATER TO THEM THEY WONT EVEN ANSWER YA BACK  WORST MONEY I'VE EVER SPENT. POOR CUSTOMER SATIFACTION .
They are too big they look like they are 14g  the balls are too big to screw onto a 16g post but they screw onto a  14 g  post  just fine. Very disappointed with this won't buy from them again cant even wear them unless you wanna gauge your piercing for them to fit .
They are really cool looking some are duplicates  great for the price really wanted the dark blue and black ones  but got mostly pink  which im not too fond of  but for the price its a good deal .
My case came super fast. It's super cute but not protective. Some of the glitter is coming off but I can't tell by looking at it. I like it .
This was a non stop read for me a 25 year old small business owner that started from nothing a little over a year ago to over a million a year in revenue. It can be done and Kevin's book and background give me the confidence to continue with new perspective .
already coming apart at brass-look center section. pole is not solid wood looks like it is made from some kind of composition material. Not a very well made quality product .
The 1st day accu-weather worked. The second and subsequent days, it didn't. The icon indicates that wifi is on and other actions indicate wifi is on but accu-weather will not download because it says wifi is not on .
It does not feel enough like a real game. The game does too much for the player. I probably should have expected that .
What caught my attention to this book is the fact that the author knows diet alone is not the answer. Sure, you can follow the healthiest diet plan, but if you lead an inactive life, you won't get far. I now understand why the people of the mediterranean are so healthy! Delicious recipes as well .
the style and color is great. But one thing I don't like is that there is no mic with the headphones .
I did not use it yet but the style and other things looks grate. I think you can buy it .
Not sure what was tearing up our yard but i decided to look for a repellant device and decided to go with this one. Electronics are good enough these days, to be inexpensive so I decided to give it 'a go'and bought two. It's pretty easy to use and it takes regular C-size batteries, and it seems to be doing the job! I gave the other one to a neighbor just in case they have the same problem. I used the AC cable and the extension cord but haven't tried the battery yet. Pretty handy .
It never hurts to have a good dietary supplement. You will quickly discover how well pure green coffeebean work in a diet. It is a simple way to lose weight or can be daily supplement to help balance youdiet .
Good quality saddle for an excellent price. Did not have to spend much to update my fixie. Love it .
Chains came well packaged with styrofoam to protect the blue chains from scratching. It also came with the masterlink that connected the link, and was a perfect length for my bike. I didn't need to use a chain cutter because it came with 96 links. Quality is great for the price I paid. Haven't had any problems with it .
Frameset is made of steel, but for such an attractive price, I don't have any complaints. Im going to use their other parts to build together a complete bike. I really like their styles .
I love this case, it doesn't lift my screen protector like most cases have. It's cheap but really does it's job. Keep in mind it pops on and doesn't protect the front of the phone much, but it is exactly what I was looking for .
I like the style and stuff. When I was purchasing I was not sure what I will get but the product is really excellent. Thank you .
Pretty cute. Very sexy and fit. I wear it in our party, fits my legs. I don't have single complain. Really its nice .
What works about this product is that combination of things. Not only does it have Chorogenic acid tohelp you burn fat, but also present is GCA. These compounds should show that this item is an efficientway to lose weight .
I know this item may seem iffy, but it turns that this product is actually great for weight loss. This isprobably best product you will find that uses chlorogenic acid, which helps you burn fat. It is a simplesupplement to use and it shouldn't change your diet(if you so happen to be on one .
As you can tell just by looking at, this is not your average top. The design behind this top is inspiring, and it certainly looks great with a number of styles. I know this is one that I am going to wear for all occasions .
Like every parent (so I believe) I look for practical advice - based on the experience of other parents, preferably those with professional knowledge.From the beginning I liked the H.H (Happy - Healthy) boundaries - managing the situation in a way that will obey the H.H principles. This was the first place I had to look myself in the mirror and admit that I don't always act in such a way... what can I say? This realization disarmed me! Made me open and receptive and strengthen my understanding that I need to change something in the way I manage daily situations with my kids.In a nutshell, this book opened my eyes and equipped me with great ideas. As my title says, I've already solved two ongoing issues.I think this book is a must read for every parent .
Excellent book - short yet with 'meaty' information that makes you look at things in a different light. The CBS principle is on one hand common knowledge yet on the other helped me analyze a tough negotiation in a way I never did before - is one example to the added value this book has.A unique and inspiring voice in the 'negotiation' section .
Used a size 26mm on the straight handlebar from projekt and had no problems with installation. Brakes worked well. Great set of brakes for a great price .
Rear brakesets came with everything as packaged. There were no problems with this product. Used the size 23.8mm brake lever for my handlebar and the brake caliper reach was perfect for my wheels .
I don't know much about scientific facts. All I wanted was to have my body back after childbirth. So I started to take these pills. These pills are so effective and work very fast. I got my figure back in no time at all .
ARX Fast Weight Loss Pills seems to be a revolutionary new natural dieting and cholesterol pill that helps increase the body&#8217;s metabolic rate and burn off fat. Not only are there no negative side effects but it also helps get rid of depression and bad moods by helping the body to release serotonin! It is a breakthrough in natural dieting pills!This could be attributed to the fact that it contains Garcinia Cambogia and Green Coffee Bean Extract. Both of these natural remedies help to reduce appetite, burn fat and lower cholesterol. If Dr. Oz praises Garcinia Cambogia &#8211; well then it must be good .
I heard about these appetite suppressants but thought it was probably too good to be true. I try to avoid ingredients that aren't natural which usually means that I avoid products that work. Thankfully, that isn't the case here and the vegetarian ingredients really have helped me curb my eating .
This is the best cache cleaning up android software available. It is powerful and efficient.Don't delete useful info or applications as some other cleaning up apps do. Some other appsdelete even essential data of op-system. The result is a system crash. This one knows how tochoose real garbage. Totally reliable and extremely useful .
I wasn't sure how to use this thing at first. I used the manual and plugged it and connected it with my android tab. The result is pretty amazing and I got all real time data from car's ECU on my screen real fast. I was totally impressed. This scanner is fast, accurate and totally trustworthy .
I'm in love with a kindle book. This one. I fall in love easily, but not always with eBooks as there really is some rubbish out there. This one beats the odds and I'm so glad I took a chance on reading it. The story is so well written that you feel as though you live in Isobel's world. I read it over two days and apart from doing the stuff I really had to do, I didn't put it down. Normally that only happens for me with paper books. I think I'm converted .
At first when I heard about the Paleo diet, I was skeptical. But since trying it, I cannot get my hands on enough. So far, I've read a few of Michael's Books because they are good solid pieces of work. I have just tried a few recipes, but am happy with it so far .
I received Colgate Optic White Toothpaste complimentary from Influenster. I have never been a fan of home whitening products but this may have changed my mind. After using for a solid week I have noticed my teeth are a shade whiter. I also love the clean feeling that this toothpaste leaves .
unit will not stay adjusted. If I put my hand near the ear piece it will go very loud.  Moving the base unit or changing channels does not help .
When i bought this i must have missed in the description that this product was a miniature version of the full book. I was not impressed. But thank you for the speedy service .
Finally after so many years someone has written a book that captures the harsh reality of a Father, and a family who watched their son go off to war in Afghanistan. That person is Mark Nielsen a 34 year veteran of the Chicago Fire Department, in his book, M Son: Boy. Man. Marine.The book is an honest unpretentious portrait of a father who modesty yet effectively recounts his son's joining the United States Marine Corps, and heading off to war. From the Marine Corps Recruiting Depot in San Diego California, to the long trip to Camp Dwyer in Afghanistan.Nielsen tells of his many long hours of praying with his church, family and friends. Always listening for the telephone to ring, and watching for that six-digit number from his son Scott. Scott informs his father of his last mission with the Thundering Third Battalion Marines, and if possible the next assignment, sometime weeks go by without a call, you can feel the tension.Nielsen gives an insightful firsthand account of the conditions that his son and many other US Marines now live, filthy conditions with no showers, and the afternoon temperatures that reach 110 degrees, as they push forward into the southernmost section of the Helmand Province.Throughout his book Nielsen tries to maintain his life back in Chicago, first with his wife, Scott's mom Margaret a nurse, his son Brett, daughter Jill, and Scott's girlfriend Michelle. Second, he tries to maintain his second family the Chicago Fire Department, as an Assistant Deputy Fire Commissioner, that responds to fires and all other incidents throughout the city of Chicago.The story moves forward with the day to day events that occur in the War, he checks the casualty lists and injury lists, and often wonders how he would be able to handle the worst news a father can get from the United States Marines.A gripping tale of a father and a family that lets his, SON: his BOY. Become a Man and a Marine, at times you might get choked up.... The book is a great read thank you for sharing your story .
I would recommend this product to all my friends.I do like it and cannot wait to take some classes with it .
Great Battery wish I thought of this before I replaced a cell phone that no longer charge. Money well spend cheaper than buying another cell phone .
Another great deal I bought crystal clear transparent hard case for all my devices. Love them drop them there are protected .
Received fast appear to be in great condition the only problem I don't need. I ordered the wrong part but I'm keeping it .
I have always loved Dooney & Bourke products but I must say I'm not impressed with the Leather Case. It is to small for the iPhone and almost phones, not room for money or any cards .
Not really happy with these hose, they  seem  small in the ankle and calf in comparison to other brands the same size, the foot is way to big and the first time wearing a hole came in them .
Not used it very much, but think I'm going to enjoy  using it,  It is a lot easier than a big bulky  hand mixer .
one hand set did not work. the box it was packed in looked like it was shipped out more than once .
This movie is incredibly well made. A mix of nightmares and harsh reality make this movie a real winner.If it wasn't for some steamy scenes I would recommend it to a younger audience. This movie has awaken our curiosity for more Bruce Lee movies and martial arts .
This was a CD Birthday present and I had it mailed to my sister born in 42.  I did not hear the music .
This was a Birthday present to myself. The music was OK.  It was sent quickly but given I ordered and payed for new the CD was not wrapped as new CD's are. The music played fine .
This is a CD I order for an upcoming Birthday for my sister born in 45. The CD was sent quickly to me. I ordered and pay for a new CD and it was not wrapped as a new CD should be. Given that I played it, it did played well I really liked the songs. I will keep it for myself and possibly order another for my sister when her Birthday comes up. Why wasn't this CD wrapped as all new CD,s are .
This was given as a present for my sister born in 51 I mailed  it to her. I did not hear it! The sender sent it to me rather than my sister. Perhaps I made an error when ordering .
If your using the old fashion razor this is great, I thought it would also sharpen todays safty razor; unless I'm useing it wrong it doesn't.  If you need a Barber Strop you will never find one as well made or priced as well as this one in a store. I do recommend it, it's well made .
The safty razor replaced the razor and strap.  It was an improvement over the razor.  Todays safty razors are an improvement over the original safty razor. I found I cut myself whenever I used it probably because I'm not use to useing it.  This butterfly razor is well made but the one side of the razor doesn't alow the blade to protrude (as needed) as much on one side as the other. I've gone back to using todays safty razor .
I was very disappointed when i got my journal. It clearly says The Twilight Journals (The Twilight Saga) to me that means you get the four books. I was hoping it would be that but it wasn't. I opened the package only to see it was just the one journal. If i would have known it wasnt all of them i wouldnt of ordered this. I had read the reviews nd all of them said they received 4 so I decided to order it but I only got one book .. I was very disappointed I wanted it to give has a gift ... Not happy with this product .
Very entertaining.very funny. DVD came on time . Had no problems. I am enjoying my purchases. I have more to watch .
I really liked this film . It is not one I had seen  before. Very quirky. But a nice old film .
What a fun book!  This was a pleasurable read; Chet was a terrific narrator and his perspective gives a whole new level of humor to the story.  I enjoyed it as an action mystery as well-- the plot wasn't obvious, which made it a real page-turner.  Definitely looking forward to reading more in the series .
this product its not original, you send me a cellphone with parts made in china, i bought a Samsung with original parts, and you send me a chinesse version .
I ordered this remote, not knowing if it would work with my Sansui tv, and specifically for the closed captioning ability.  First, it came 2 DAYS early (yay), was a breeze to set up, and the captioning works perfectly.  Very satisfied with this remote!!!  As an added note, this remote has the setup codes for hundreds of TVs and other devices .
Reading for my sailing interest but the history and interesting facts not generally known made it a great and factual read .
both codes weren't working also the game box was broken like somebody opened it many times and threw it away in the garbage, at least in arrived so soon .
im so happy with this bag !! great quality everything fits ! i will deff be buying more in different colors & i don't have that order people are talking about so thank god!!! oh and it shipped fast!! :) very happy .
I won't even use it . I font trust it to keep my phone safe. I'll stick with the name brands .
Great addition to the Nightshade novels! I really enjoyed this one and finished it quickly.The only thing that could have made it better is an extended &#34;ending.&#34; It just kind of stops...makes sense...but I didn't want it to end.Thanks Andrea .
These sheets are nice and not too bad for the price.They are soft but not as soft as I would like.Color is great .
Purchased for my boyfriend. I love this fragrance but I did not want to buy the regular size, plus it is way to expensive.Great size, price and fragrance! Thank you .
If you are a fan, i suggest getting the Blueray/DVD box set to relive all the amazing Eric magic! Don't forget about Lafayette...he is amazing .
Great wig! I will love taking pics with this one. The colors are complimentary as well as sexy! Plus it is not too long, so it is more functional .
Very pretty but took way to long to get here. It is a nice green color, sparkly etc. This piece is big but not too big. It looks great in a mess of curled hair .
Very cute and sexy corset. Size/fit and color are great. It did seem small but hey that's what a corset does...you loosen it then cinch it back up. Definitely great for a costume with the added flourishes. I am looking forward to playing with it.The added material at the bottom does not cover much so an additional garment will be necessary .
This hat exceeded my expectations! It does not look cheap and really fits my husband well. It is going to look great for our Gatsby party .
I love this costume. It is made well and does not seem &#34;cheap&#34;. The fit is perfect and it was great for Halloween .
what can I say about dunlop picks. they are great picks. you get what you ordered. the only thing i didn't like is the logo starts fading away the second you start playing .
you get what is advertized. it works. its good, not much to say really. if you need one, buy it .
cheap, yet great quality. fits perfectly. great fabric, i do not regret buying this. i am sure you won't either .
great case, good quality. tough as hell. it does what its supposed to do. nothing else is needed to be said .
The delivery of my order arrived way ahead of schedule BUT 4 out of 10 I ordered of the above item are BAD &#34;not working&#34;. I doubt if there was a quality control done before shipping out the order. Your response is highly appreciaited. Thanks, Willie .
the victoria secret zipper travel lingerie laundry bag works GREAT!!! It is everything I wanted for my lingerie. The other lingerie bags aren't as private .
Most "how to" or "do it yourself" books I have read through make me cringe with incorrect information or bad product advice. Mr Litchfield's book is NOT to be included in this category. Thoughtfully laid out with photos, easy to read descriptions and plans make this book a must have for anyone thinking of tackling their own project or hiring someone else. My Nephew has recently bought his first home and has asked for tools for Christmas. I can't think of a better tool than this book, (And it's far less dangerous than anything with a chord attached). I will also add a copy for each new employee I hire as required reading. Well done Mr. Litchfield .
I enjoyed this game, but would have liked to have more interaction with the ghosts.  They were mostly just a shadow and not having much impact on game play .
would like to order the es 3833, too, but can't seem to find one...this is a very good shaver and nice for gifts .
I hope these are the worst shoes I brought in my entire life. They really are a piece of garbage. I bought them to give to my mother and after two weeks of use synthetic upper broke on the edge where strike with the sole. They were unless.  Do not waste your money on this, quality is very bad.  I will never buy this brand shoes again .
These are the worst shoes I had in my entire life. Really are a piece of scrap. With few hours of use both tips were unsticked. I sticked them but one week later right shoe broke uppers material on the edge strike with the sole. They were unserviceable. Do not waste your money on this, they look beauty but quality is very poor. I will never buy this brand shoes .
I hate it, nothing like I expected. It is just poorly put together in every way. The picture makes it look way to good .
Works better than expected. Not much of a bass from the outside but hits hard inside of the car. It was a great buy in my opinion .
This came earlier than expected and everything was there. I love this double din. Fit perfectly in my car, didn't have to cut or drill anything extra. Fit right where it's suppose to be .
I have been using skinomi screen protectors for years on my phones so I went with this one for my iphone 5.  It is easy to put on and by 1-2 days it is completely clear with no bubbles or dust underneath.  Just follow the instructions and it should turn out great like every one I have done in the past.  It is a little scary using the liquid solution but as long as you soak up the excess solution it seems to be fine.  I trusted it on my brand new iphone so that says something .
The book was a good book.  l have always like Dolly and thought it would be interesting to read about her dreams.  The only thing I didn't like is the book read too quickly.  It was too short .
With the iPhone 4 you can not just replace a digitizer, you also need a LCD screen that you cannot take off your old digitizer. This is pointless to buy and people shouldn't sell just this part .
The reason why i choose this rating is it came with one charger, the remote should have a separate button to control each collar. I mean if i wanted to buzz one dog instead of both dogs you would be able to. This remote only has one small black button to buzz them so if you want to buzz one dog you wouldn't be able to .
I didn't like this product because it did not fit my furniture. I would recommand that you some how measure thefurniture before buying it .
This is a great life jacket for boating activities. Good fit and turned our daughter on her back as designed during quick test.  This is not designed for swimming in .
My kids and I loved this book! It's packed with lots of humor and a fun story line. We kept turning the pages, laughing much of the way. We want to buy the next few books in the series. Who doesn't want more joy and laughter in life?In addition to the humor, we appreciate how Beamer, Bash's cousin, grows from his cousin's influence; albeit he does protest the stretching like most of us do. One can't help feel sorry for the aunt's nervous tick developed I'm sure from this zany bunch.We highly recommend Bash and the Pirate Pig!Posted by Michelle and Patrick Welsh family .
did not do what was advertised, therefore would not work in the unit.  This unit would not keep the cab warm at all .
Books is in good condition. The 4 star rating isn't due to amazon but the book is overall boring and not intriguing .
The sandals are awesome looking and fit perfect. The are super cool and I can't wait to wear them while im on vacation in Aruba for xmas .
Awesome look and fits perfect. Not too loose or too tight. I love digital camo so this is perfect for me .
these board shorts are awesome and have a sweet design. The color is awesome and I can't wait to wear them .
The design is awesome and the fit is great. Can't wait to wear it while im in Aruba for xmas .
This book was very intense and exciting. I couldn't put it down. I just wish the ending was better. It's not clear enough for me .
This tea tastes so much better than the gunpowder green tea I have been buying.  I am also a bit of a history buff and even though this may not be from Japan, it is of the type used for the Japanese Tea Ceremony which I perform among a few friends every once in a while.  And when I'm not using it for the ceremony, it comes in single serving pouches so I can just sit down and enjoy a nice cup of tea!  This makes excellent iced tea as well!  Highly recommend this Matcha Tea .
This product actually does something as opposed to many I've tried.  Now, I didn't drop 100 pounds in a week or anything miraculous like that, but I do find that I am less hungry than I used to be.  I used to eat due to boredom and a host of other little things.  With this product, I find that sometimes I'm not even hungry when it's mealtime!  This product has at the very least proven itself to be a good start in a weightloss plan .
I can't prove that this product has made me lose weight (my husband got mad because I was doing better at losing weight than he was and destroyed our scale), but my clothing fits looser now.  And, this product has the added bonus of tasting fantastic!  It tastes to me like honey with just a tad bit of molasses!  Makes fantastic iced tea and ice cream and is an excellent replacement for most anything where your would use a sweet sauce.  I highly recommend this product .
Being an herbalist, I have done some research on these ingredients.  Mostly good things, and a few bad.  However, I can say that my husband and I have not been this &#34;close&#34; in years!  Give this product a try.  Nothing works on everyone (those little blue pills didn't do much for my husband), but I would certainly recommend giving this a shot .
I spent years at the beach when I was younger and using sunscreen was uncool.  Well, my skin suffered for it.  Using this product has already taken years off my complexion in just days!  I can't wait to see what it does after I use it for weeks!  And you need so little for it to help.  A few drops is all you need to rub into your skin and watch the years melt away!  Thank you, Natural Beauty .
This product is very well manufactured.  Most fish oil pills have oil on the outside of the pill, I assume from the manufacturing process, and taste like freezer burned fish.  Not these.  No fishy taste in the mouth when you take it or any later that I've noticed.  Excellent product and will buy again .
I can't believe my mother-in-law (widowed, sexually repressed and 84) loved it. People can surprise you! She must have a most exciting inner life .
Great documentary. Finally a documentary that covers the subject of melanin. Very factual. Each commentator is exact and on point with information. Learned so much I hadn't learned before. Dr. Booker T Coleman and KRS brought nothing but truth. I plan on buying another copy for my friends and family .
Poetic acceleration was a great surprise for me. Although my normal reading habits don't usually include books from this genre, i enjoyed the perspective the author has shared with me.  I am always interested in being challenged to understand the eternal perception of others in the world and i feel this book has expanded mine. Thank you .
Recently I was interested in playing a few classic Nintendo games and I saw this, andI love the look of the console itself, eeminds me of the famicom. Anyway, let me get into some pros and cons of the console.Pros:-Compatible wih almost the entire NES library (only a dozen or so games don't work)-Very cheap in comparison to the original NES & NES toploader-It looks good, not as good as an original Nintendo, but still good-The 2 packaged in controllers are nice, they aren't pretty, but they feel decent and have good features-You can use original NES controllers, because it has the standard NES port-The console feels sturdy, but is very lightCons:-The plastic feels cheap, but it's not horrible by any means-A few games aren't compatible-The console is really light and that bothers me, I like hefty videogame consoles, you feel like youre buying something with more qualityOverall the console is a nice alternative to buying a Nintendo. You'll save a bit of cash and if you get some official Nintendo controllers or some nice 3rd party controllers then the experience shouldn't be any different from playing an original NES.4/5 .
Everything I sent for, I received in excellent condition and promptly.  I have absolutely no complaints.  Recommend it to anyone.  A. B .
Love this makeup.  I love how it goes on and stays on and doesn't dry your skin, as do other products .
the phone is peice  of junk first of all the battery is no good  it will not hold a charge. The person who delever the phone was very un coot .I have a 6085h for 3years  never miss a beat which is anawsome phone which i thought  i was getting .this was a waist of time & good money not happy  with this purchase atall .
I am disappointed with the color of the pearls studs. they are yellowish, not a nice crisp white, this can happen if they  are not the last item on and first off they are very porus, and stain easy. hair spray and perfume are the most common offenders of this gem .
This is a piece of art, the way they describe France seems really accurate for those years. I have watched this film some times by now, but I could not finish it the first time. Be prepared for a really shocking movie! I have seen more movies than the average population but Irreversible is still a piece of art .
The mats are great, the only issue is that in the picture you can see two holes... in real they don't have them .
The design is great but the quality is not the best, I have used it maybe 20 times (2 months) by now and it seems like I have been using it for the double of time, I have other belt that actually look like new even within a year of use .
It is a nice coat and it is actually better than I thought. I am not sure how many uses it will last, but for me it already worths its price .
For me Asics is a nice brand and I normally like their products. This is not the exception, this short is comfortable and perfect for running .
I never expected to see a good movie, just one for sleeping, but definitely you always learn others points of view on every movie. I did like it .
I really enjoyed the characters and story lines in these books! Can't wait for the next book to come out .
I bought these with the hopes of only there rabies tags not knowing what I would get, with the good reviews I hoped for the best.They are perfect my three dogs now will be silent tonight for the first time in years.I would email seller asap to get your collars asap although she may email you before you can email her.Awesome seller awesome product .
100% SatisfiedLiked the product I recommendThe Product is Strong and DurableI recommend the large small ChildrenWhich May Not Have Parties do harm to children .
i apreciate the concern about how we feel about the items we purchase ! the only thing is that we CANT really judge how we feel if we haven't received the item first.  maybe there is a way to change the system where you guys get notified after the customer receives it .  thanks  again .
My sons birthday is coming up and as a lot of kids are, he is really into Mickey Mouse Clubhouse! This cake topper is perfect and is going to look so cute! Its good for the price and will make him party extra special! He is going to love his cake! I cannot wait for him to see it .
I started taking these a little over a month ago, and I already lost 16lbs! I cannot wait to see how much I can lose in another month! It is so easy to take and it is actually working for me! I would suggest buying these and giving them a try .
i got this game and i got to 7gb and it reset at 0.it won't even download when i get far it will reset on mei wont ever get a game download from amazon ever!!!I WANT MY MONEY BACK .
I finished 2 things this week:1.)  My sister's new book,  THE ART OF FLOATING.2.)  My brother-in-law's homemade Irish chutney that I brought back to NC following my travels to Maine and Massachusetts.I cozied up this past week in my favorite reading nook in my comfy overstuffed chair complete with an ottoman and a blanket....my nose buried in THE ART OF FLOATING.  Several nights I stayed up past my regimented bedtime simply because I could not put the book down.In my most unbiased opinion (well....maybe I'm a little biased.  I mean she is my sister and all.  Not to mention brilliant, artistic and worldly!) my sister produced a treasured story.  While the power of losing something is often indescribable, my sister puts into words what so many of us are unable to describe.  So vivid, so true and most importantly, so relatable.Just like my brother-in-law's famous chutney straight from his mom's SECRET Irish recipe book, THE ART OF FLOATING is full of mystery and intrigue...with a little bit of spice that make it all its own!  The book combines the power of loss and the glory of discovery AND the process of healing in the face of tragedy.This story is told with a sweetness so tender it will open your heart.  You did it, sis!  THE ART OF FLOATING is truly a work of art that the world should hear.  And as my dad (who typically sticks to books and articles related to history and politics) stated &#34;This isn't just a woman's book.  Everyone should read this!&#34;I love you, Kristin Bair O'Keeffe!!  Congratulations .
Did not work.  Called camco and they told me there were some that were wired wrong.  They sent me an e-mail showing how to rewire it correctly.  I rewired it and it still wouldn't get hot, not even warm.  Gave up and bought a hot water on demand for $240 more .
This whole book is not what I expected. He is writing stories about his life.And it is a big mistake from your side, I could not click to view to see what is the subject in this book.I would not by it.Is it possible to send it back?Thank you .
I must admit I was skeptical as the last time I purchased this product from another vendor I paid over 200.00. This product was not only unbelievably less expensive it works great. I would absolutely recommend this purchase and if I ever need it again this is my link .
This Mid-bass is simply awesome! It can handle enormous amounts of power for such a small speaker, and a mid bass at that. It has no problem handling highs and putting out a little thump. Even if this speaker is used for just a general component speaker it would perform amazing. no complaints .
It is who it is about!  And who wrote it.  It is in the cluod and not in the Kindle, which is where I wanted it to be&#62 .
An older movie that was good.  The musical score is also good.  And it tells a part of history that gets ignored.  We need to learn from that history so we don't repeat it .
I hopen they turn this saga into movie.....i can't wait till the third book comes out...great love story..action.....i read this book twice,then read dreamless twice .
This book picked up keep me on my toes....I could t get enough of Kate,Henry .I can't wait to read next book .
i really loved this saga.alot of action....the story of patch and nora i read all the hush hush saga this was another saga i read twice..iloved it so much it keep me on my toes i couldn't put the book down .
I love this book.  .....it keep me going the hole time....this book would be great as a movie I can't w ait for the next book .
I can't wait for vol 5,amy has done an amazing job on this book all of them.......I would love to see this on the big screen .
i  love the story  of hades. stephannie did a really good job on this book,plus her series chidren of khaos where all really good books..i read them all a couple of times.......can't get enuff .
They sent a bad code!!! ;(  I can't believe it man, I was super excited too! I just wasted 40 bucks .
Got these as a gift for my granddaughter...she totally loves them. Thanks bunches! Can't wait to purchase more for her .
I love this product! It is absolutely perfect for what i use it for. But there are some minor problems but are barely noticeable if you're like me.The only problems I've encountered is a buzz in the left earphone but when i'm playing COD there is a lot of action and is not noticeable until the action dies down or until i'm in the pre-game lobby.The only other problem is when i go at-least 15 feet away from the receiver it cuts in and out of connection but again barely noticeable if you're actually playing the game.But overall i give this headset a 4 because of its pros .
this was a text book for a university class so i needed it quickly and the book was in perfect condition and delivered extremely fast.one quality concern... a group of about 20-30 pages were not cut at the top properly so they were formed together almost as one thick page which i had to tear apart. i did not find it a big enough deal to complain or file anything as the seller was very exceptionalthank you .
I love this case!  It fit perfectly.  It fits very snug and securely, and is made of a very firm foam.  The foam is so firm that if you squeeze it between your fingers as hard as you can, you can feel it &#34;give&#34; only slightly.  The swival handle/kickstand  is stiff enough to stay where ever you set it.  The Lindle sets in the case in such a way that, even if you dropped it on it's face, it probably wouldn't damage the screen.  (honestly haven't tried that)  I think this is an excellent case at a fair price .
Liked the way the story developed. Good to see the nerd get the pretty girl. Show that you should not judge people at first sight .
This book was written by an author with a TON of experience on the subject. Lots of interesting tidbits of info on how air behaves as it passes through not only the engine, but through both the intake and exhaust systems. The book is a bit math heavy, so it's not written like a typical DIY engine book. It's more of a reference for those who are building engines on the professional level. If you skip most of the math (as I did), the book is pretty easy to read/understand .
Great show. Can't keep your eyes off. Kept me on my toes. Loved it. I watched it all in 2 days .
If you want hands free music and talk give this a go. Noise cancelled out on a bike forget it. i don't care the brand or the cost, at least thats been my experience. The cost of this was peanuts compared to most. So good for the most part, worth the price in any case .
Really like this showerhead. It looks great, has good pressure and a nice water spread. I don't use the jet feature, but it works if needed .
This stock wrench worked well; I was able to replace a broken collapsible stock with a new one with no problems .
It's just a well thought out peace no more looking for the crib board let alone the cards and those pesky pegs its just all there .
Words cannot describe how much I loved this product! It came much earlier than the expected date. I apply it after I shower and it does an amazing job detangling my hair :) Love this product .
So perfect! My cell is well protected and the quality is amazing. Not to mention the case is adorable! Loved it .
I ordered this item for my car. It sticks on the car window perfectly! It adds personality to my car and I don't think most people know what it represents either so all the better .
I ordered this product thinking it would come with the connection cord (silly me). But no, it comes individually! So don't expect to actually be able to USE this product upon arrival, my fellow Amazon shoppers! Because you can't. There's no cord. There's no installation CD. You'll have to order those seperately. I would comment on how well the actual product is, but I couldn't plug it into my computer so I have no idea.Had to return this item and recieved full refund, which I am thankful for.But the seller does not inform the buyer like he/she should .
I have a macbook air and there is no CD drive installed into the computer. So this is the perfect item to complete my mac. I emailed this seller to make sure the item came with both the connection cord and the installation CD (the last one I bought came individually and didn't explain that in the description [not this seller]). The seller responded quickly and ensured me that it does come with all it's supposed to come with. So I ordered it! It arrived very quickly and in superb condition!Very pleased with this purchase .
I wear a size 0g and I absolutely love these! They are perfectly flared on each end so that it doesn't slip out and they aren't impossible to get in. The amethyst design is beautiful and very good quality. I highly recommend these plugs; very unique .
This product smelled nice and manly. However, the scent didn't last very long. Most car freshners don't, so it isn't much different from the others .
These are simple black acrylic tapers; they came in time but not in the correct color. They actually came in clear. I didn't mind but just beware of inconsistency .
These tapers are a good deal and a good quality. I ordered three sizes at a time and they sent me one of the wrong size, so I had to return all three and re-order. It was an inconvenience, but they corrected it with no problem .
I love this style, but ended up having to return it because the hole in the middle was very tiny. I wear size 0g, but it still was not as big as the holes usually are. I just didn't like the look of the hole. I recommend buying this one when your gauges are a little bigger than just 0g; it makes your plugs look tiny .
This item came exactly as pictured but when I recieved the item, it seemed extremely cheap. I've never held in my hand such cheap quality. And trust me, I buy a lot of cheap jewelry. It's fine if cheap is what you're looking for, but ehh. Wouldn't recommend it .
I have ordered about five of these exact keychains because they keep breaking. They aren't the best quality keychains, however, they don't cost very much. So if you're looking for quality, this isn't the keychain for you. However, if you're looking for temporary style, this is the place to find it .
My grandson loves this truck he hasn't stopped playing with it.i recommend this truck it's definitely worth it a great buy .
the boots are light weight but they are not warm at all so the term blizzard is not correct I like the solid grip on them and the overall build is really nice .
this is a great item it adjust every way you need it too I will never not have a whisker biscuit again this item puts the drop away to shame you don't have to worry bout it working or not because it is not mechanical  I have shot over 1000 arrows with it and still like new .
when I first got this I liked it a lot but every time I got my bow out of my case the sight had moved you are not able to tighten it enough to stay in place so you bump it getting into your stand it moves .
This flag is missing a star...I didn't notice it for a day or so when I first took it out. Now that I have noticed it, I don't see anything else. I guess I shouldn't expect much more for 5 bucks .
I love Ellen's Show and I think she's one of the funniest women around. So I was looking forward to read her book... and got very disappointed. This book was just another way for her to make more money. It's funny at the beginning but it's getting old after the first few pages. She just takes random subjects and writes 2 or 3 pages about it; the chapters have no connection at all. You can tell that she just tried to "fill" as many pages possible. For example her chapter about Meditation: 4 blank pages!!! I wouldn't mind that much if her book had been 4$ or less... but paying the prize for a "real" book (where every page is written on) is just too much! DISAPPOINTING .
I feel like I was duped.  Fill a childs plastic trick or treating pail with water and that is exactly how cheap this is.  Smoking caldron?  It doesn't smoke outside of thr cauldron itself.  It is worth no more than thirty dollars.  I went by previous review s.  I am so disappointed .
Mabel and  Jack have moved from the comforts of home and family in 1920's Pennsylvania  to take up homesteading in Alaska.  Having given birth to a stillborn child  ten years earlier,  Mabel,  still childless, finds the noisy chatter of children and adult talk of parenthood at family gatherings  painful reminders of her own loss.  Lured by the hopes of a fresh start in the quiet solitude of the Alaskan wilderness, neither she nor Jack are prepared for the harsh realities of trying to survive and make a living there.Late on the eve of the first snowfall,  Mabel  ventures outside.  Jack follows her, and they build  a snow child in the image of a little girl.  They adorn her with scarf and mittens and go back inside. The next morning, Jack is puzzled when he sees the  fleeting figure of a young girl dart through the trees. He is even more perplexed when he notices that the snow child has crumbled and the scarf and mittens are gone.  And it is at this moment that the enchantment begins.In eloquent and vivid detail,  Eowyn Ivey seamlessly weaves together the physical and the ethereal in her updated version of an old Russian fairy tale. Graphic descriptions of the wilds of Alaska magically  transport the reader there, while the story's characters, including the spritely snow child Faina, seem to be as real as  one's next-door neighbors.  Ivey  delivers the story in such a way that the implausible seems plausible, that reality and fantasy are one,  and that anything is possible if you believe in it. If you're looking for a story that  will capture your imagination and touch your heart, don't miss this book .
Love this version of Scrabble! The computer is a decent opponent, using words that increase my Scrabble vocaulary in the bargain. Best parte? The computer wastes no time taking its turn .
This game is much more challenging than it appears to be at first. I love the use of tools to help get players from one level to another. The &#34;out-of-the-box&#34; thinking that is required is enjoyable and challenging. However, only one hint is provided at each level, and it is not always helpful. Since there is no other strategy guide, going online for help is a nuisance. It is also frustrating to have to begin each level from the start when you  repeatedly get burned or eaten, etc .
At the start, this game appears to be not much of a challenge. But having played other similar games that start out with easy solutions, I expect that it will become more challenging at the higher stages. What keeps the game enjoyable is the panel of choices the player has for how he might need to use the tools he collects. An unexpected and creative spin on the usual escape the room games .
This game is one of the most annoying games I've ever played. I like these types of games, but the correct puzzle solutions either have to be executed repeatedly before they work, or the tools do not move into their correct places. Had I known this game was so riddled with technical problems I would not have purchased it. Execution needs much work.  A hint guide would be a plus as well. Very disappointing .
this product is good i heard about it, from other womans, After I did my research when I had my miscarriage and I have pcos but, my doctor won't give me anything because they feel as if I got pregnant I'm fine. But once I bought this cream and can say my night sweats have gone and I stop it and notice it came back so yes it does work and I will contuie to buy this product .
the only reason I'm giving it less stars than it deserves is because of the writing errors. there wasn't a lot but there was definitely enough for you to notice. But... this series is still amazing. I didn't want to put them down. I would definitely recommend these books .
First thing that stood out was that the seller was fast to respond to questions and gave clear and concise answers. Very professional, nice to talk to.Having previously purchased a watch from Amazon, the second thing that stood out was the packaging. The watch box was packaged securely and presented no chance to damage from the shipping process.Then there's the watch itself which is absolutely stunning. Personally I'm not going to wear it every day because everything about it commands for a special occasion.Overall the watch arrived fast and I'm fully satisfied with the purchase. If you are thinking about buying it I would recommend that you do so now because it sells out fast and I've made the mistake of waiting the first time I saw it and had to wait for a while before it was back in stock again .
I can't praise this book enough! Perfect for anyone with religous concerns.I plan on ordering many more for our church .
This app sucks for my kindle fire i have my sound turnt up but i can't hear anything when i push it .
After using over 10 cases for my iPod, iPhone 4, and now the iPhone 5, I can say this is one of the best on the market. It's a huge improvement over the last generation of Candyshells, as it's slightly thinner, and doesn't have the droopy bottom problem on the iPod touch version. It's extremely solid, and the soft rubber part is much less rubbery than previously, and easier to slip in and out of a pocket. The port openings are fairly large, especially compared to other cases. I've heard of problems with the rubber disintegrating, but mine seems good so far - I will update if anything changes. Yes the back is very susceptible to scratching, but any shiny, glossy case will scratch, and that's what the case is there for .
Is helping me so much during my first pregnancy.  All my questions are answered, even ones I didn't know I had.  My husband has also found it very interesting and has read some of it.  It even covers what to do after baby comes.  If your expecting I suggest this book for sure .
This is very good deal and very attractive. its not cheap at all. DO NOT HESITATE TO BUY THIS TOP .
This shoe is so elegant and very classy. The only concern i have was it is a little snug in-front foe a 100% synthetic material, i had to exchange it for a size up. Other than that i had no problems and i'm planning to buy it in a different color .
Movie had a good performance. But the last 20 minutes of the movie could not be seen since it was freezing constantly. I bought it as used in very good condition .
This book takes another crazy turn!  Great storyline, great characters, overall I just couldn't put it down.  I had never read anything by this author before now, can't wait to see if all their books are this good .
The story was cute, semi-predictable.  The low rating is due to the ending. I honestly didn't see it coming, not in the twist of a story kind of way but that it just ended.  I felt like the ending came out of nowhere. I actually went back a page to make sure I didn't somehow skip to the end or something .
They always say the book is better than the movie and it holds true with this trilogy. A story so fantastic you won't be able to put it down .
Is there a second one if not there should be. You can't end a book about love and list and never find out if they end up together or not .
I absolutely did not want to put this book down, and I was disappointed when it was over. The author has a way of bringing out each personality and remaining consistent throughout the book. I could actually see the landscapes and picture in my mind where each place was when described. I never thought I would want to go to Alaska, but now I do .
This book was so very inspiring. It helps remove the feeling of being alone and the guilt asdociated with loss. Bad things not only happen to good people, but good people do not have to necessarily give up when bad things hit .
My grandkids are loving this book, asking for it to be read as their night time story book before bed. They are ages 3 and 7, and even if they don't get the concepts taught to them in school, they will learn them in an unforgettable way through this beautiful and funny book .
Anyone who enjoys delving into the possibilities of the physical and spiritual will surely enjoy this as much as I did! It kept me coming back for more and hating to put it down when I had to. The author did a great job of describing this fantasy world and the nature of the demons who can get hold of our own world, using deceit to make us into whatever they want. Can't wait to see what happens in the next book and if our heroine can defeat what evil has taken hold of her .
This is very good quality for a costume. I love how bright and durable the fabric is. My only complaint is that the measurements--as said in previous comments--are geared more toward men or women with longer torsos. I have longer legs and a short torso, and I'll likely need to either have it adjusted or tie it around my waist in a Portal 2 style rather than wearing it normally. It fits perfectly otherwise, or else I would return it and size down. All in all a very good product, but it's a risk if you're not sure on what size you might need .
Great value. Upgrade to steel drive shafts, plastic ones broke after 3 batteries. Not even running lipo. 2wd slash is fast and powerful. ESC is not waterproof and has no mounting pegs. Overall great combo .
I ordered these, expecting them to be cheap, but they were very nice. The color was identical to my Leg Avenue Classic Cinderella costume, and they are very smooth & sturdy. It really added that extra touch to my costume, and I'm really glad I got them. Now, however, I have relatively long/narrow fingers, so it may not fit as well if you think you have thicker fingers. But for me, they fit like a glove *ba dum tsss .
There was nothing about this costume I didn't like. It was extremely comfortable, cute, warm, and everyone loved it! I wore it to a Halloween party and it was perfect for the outdoor bonfire. Even better, I've also worn it as pajamas for the cold Minnesota winter nights. I would recommend it to anyone who wants a fun and functional costume .
When I ordered this, I had a 34DD chest and 38&#34; hip. I had gotten a large. But it hugged my hips and butt really tight and unflattering, and strapped my boobs down, thus making them look saggy. I loved the color and material, and if you  are more petite, this would be great for you! But for curvier girls, like myself, I would not recommend .
When I first got it, I loved it! I loved the color, the material, etc. However, I was wearing push-up a bra when I first tried it on. I am quite busty (34DDD), I had got a Large, and it was still way too baggy in the chest! When I tried to wear it with a push-up bra, it went really low and I had cleavage for days. When I didn't wear a push-up bra, it was really baggy. If you have time and money to get it tailored, or if you like extra cleavage, this is definitely the costume for you! It was comfortable and all, it was just hard to constantly be pulling up the front .
Oh my goodness this is an awesome product! I have never used it before but I ordered it and was not disappointed! It was awesome! Compliments the perfume so well! Will order more in the future .
I have been wearing this perfume for over 15 years...I LOVE it! It is my signature scent! :) I love purchasing it here because it ALWAYS arrives quickly and the price is AWESOME! I can't get a better price anywhere else .
Cute stylish affordable. It is cheap and wonderful. I've dropped my phone several times and This case doesn't disappoint. GOOD PURCHASE .
I love this show. I watch it all the time whenever I want. i can't wait until Sean proposes. this is my first season watching the show .
Best choice for learning and daily practice not only for beginners but also for advanced drummers that like sometimes to&#34;go back to the roots&#34 .
It was all bent out of shape it works but not that well... Wow word requriments really im not too happy .
I say 1 star because I was looking for a western game. BUT NOT WITH SUPERNATURAL FOES TAKE THAT OUT AND I WILL GET IT AGAIN I GET SCARED EASILY .
when I played my heli got stuck in the same position going left don't waste time or mbthis is the worst game ever .
IF YOU CURRENTLY HAVE MINECRAFT PE FOR ANY TABLET OR PHONE GET THIS. YOU CAN ADD ANYTHING THAT YOU WANT INTO YOUR INVENTORY IN SURVIVAL . NOW I DONT HAVE TO GO MINING ANYMORE I ALREADY HAVE 255 DIAMONDS .
it Sufis because if you have less than 10 coins you can't go nonlinear and you need to buy stuff to move on in campaighn .
This is really good for an app that was not made by mojang officially I used Honeydews skin and it worked perfectly the only downfall is that; honeydew maybe the only skin I have yet to find any others overall its good XD .
this game is one of the very best games ive played. the pictures can't descripe the real graphics in the game.  my only wish is that they made all the zombies normal and not like left for dead where there are different kinds.some of the new zombies look pretty disgusting lol .
So I'm aloud to get any app I want and I don't wanna spend. 6.99 on ANYTHING. Pleease lower the price to. 99 so I can buy it .
Not fit for real comic book superhero fans,lets face it,not even is it just borinig but now they need all these permissions..... lol ya right don't get this app I agree with Robert also .
its graphics are stellar,gameplay sucks....they need to make this more like spiderman so u can free roam and it needs controls too not tappinv around .
I downloaded this and was having the greatest time playing it but I was getting low on gold so I decided to re install,low and behold I can't reinstall it,even after resetting of it says I still have it installed and I can only open it which doesn't work....sloppy job amazon sloppy job .
not only was this book an easy read, but it really makes you think about your faith! I recommend this book to anyone young or old, believer or non believer because it is going to force you to look at your current belief system and reevaluate things with faith in mind. Good bless the Burpo family for sharing their story .
DO NOT BUY!!!!!! From the get go the unit was horrible. The exhaust fan hose fell out of the window housing, the unit filled with water within one day, leaked all over the hardwood floors and warped them. And the unit has a light that is supposed to warn you when the unit is full of water, did not come on. The air blows sideways out of the unit with no way to fix it. It now constantly drips water even when it is not turned on. I also heard they do not make replacement parts for this unit anymore. STAY AWAY .
The cas&eacute; is great for me because not only is it durable but it looks good to. People often ask if I have an iPhone.... It makes me laugh a bit. But the case is beautiful and well made. I love it. And i got fast from amazon in just 3 days. I would order again from amazon.com .
This item was received very quickly. The text looks brand new, has no marks, or bends on the pages or anything. The text itself is a great book, it has several different articles of educational research to help pre-service and in service teachers analyze .
My 3 year old daughter loves this book! We borrowed it from our library, but she did not want to return it! I had to buy her a copy for herself, since she enjoys reading and she LOVES the CARS movies. Before the book came in the mail,  I convinced her to let the borrowed one go by explaining how other children would not be able to enjoy the pleasure of reading the book if she kept it. The next day, hers showed up in the mail! Awesome .
The men in the movie are not hot and the story was lame.  I would not suggest this movie to anyone .
This story is different from Hamiltons' other books with Anita Blake.  It just shows where she stands with the police, not anything real exciting like her other books.  I enjoyed it but it really didn't have a purpose .
Sunshine takes you on a personal journey to Jamaica where she encounters many situations that are never spoken about.  Sunshine visits the beautiful country looking for love and is encountered by the many underlying issues and scams. This book was a great read, sexy, exhilarating and very informative .
Clearly,  a retyped knock off brand.  The front cover isn't even consistent with the front cover they show on their page.  After one month of use most of the pages started falling out of the binding.  It also caused me to turn in several incorrect homework assignments, because the section problems didn't align with the section problems in the legitimate 8th edition version.  When I reported this complaint the seller didn't even get back to me.  Don't buy this book from this seller .
Be careful when opening and closing the door.  If you accidentally shut it to hard batteries move around and turn off its electronic key pad function.  So make sure you keep the key in a safe place that isn't in the safe.  Overall for what you spend it is a wonderful safe .
Came with everything stated in the description.  Sleek look with protective cover. Couldn't of asked for anything more for the low price .
So far in the first few weeks of use no sign of breaking down. Seems durable and is extremely comfortable even for hiking .
I was more than happy to receive a special travel package that included a tube of Euphoria lotion at no extra cost .
It's not the color that looks like on amazon.... It's to tight on the phone!!!  The reception is bad once the cover is on the phone .
Formal dress at a decent price, nothing exciting about it - VERY lightweight. Would be great for an outdoor summer wedding. I am tall so it was a little shorter than I had hoped but for the price you can't be too picky. The color was DEAD on and exactly the shade I needed. In the picture it looks more fitted around the middle than it was, but overall, a nice dress and again, can't complain about the price. It arrived in a soft bag like package, not a box - dress was folded in a loose clear plastic bag inside .
Love t this stuff ! I am diabetic and I have tried many sweeteners. My search is over YACON, is the answer!  It does not have the nasty taste like other sweeteners do. I have also found I have more energy since using Yacon. I love this stuff, thank you Yacon .
I buy one of these items every couple of months. It gets the job done. However, I wish it was a little better. but based on the price, I cannot complain .
I had a hard time installing this item. ended up returning it. I am not giving it a 1 star because I never really ended up using it. But I did have a hard time installing it .
I wasn't sure if I would liked this item at the time of ordering it. However, when I received it and installed it, It was a perfect match.I recommend it .
This item broke in 1 day. I didn't bother returning. I hate to give 1 star feedbacks. But I would not recommend this product .
we remodeled our daughter's bedroom. This light was a perfect match for the room. My daughter was very excited about many things in her room and the light was one of them. It isn't too flashy. It blends in very nicely .
good product. good price. love the service. I needed a simple thermostat nothing fancy. This item got the job done .
Item worked for about 2 weeks. cheap quality item. I am giving it a 3 star because while it worked, it was a nice item. too bad it didn't last too long .
As a teacher, it's always shocking how little resources exist for teaching about the colonies. However, this book does an excellent job of showing how delicate the relationship was between the Natives and the Americans. It also clearly illustrates the struggles early settlements like Jamestown had in dealing with hunger, disease, and the threat of attack. It's not overly graphic, but death plays a major role throughout the book .
As a teacher, I am constantly looking for books that highlight the struggles our forefathers had in forging this great nation. There are plenty of books that do that job extremely well. &#34;Dear America: The Winter of Red Snow&#34; is an excellent historical fiction book that contains some great details of the hardships of Valley Forge. Rush Limbaugh's book, however, is not a good example.I have no personal bias toward Mr. Limbaugh. Like most pundits, he seems to be spot on at times and wildly irrational at others. There's no denying he's an exceptionally gifted orator, but that doesn't mean he'll smoothly transition into a historical fiction writer. But even if you have never heard of Mr. Limbaugh you wouldn't be able to read this book without wondering if he had a background in politics. Rush's own political views appear frequently throughout the book. This is fine if you are aligned with his views, but if you are trying to teach history from the standpoint of those that actually lived it, then this book will definitely be misleading. It's also a bit inaccurate at times on the roles of key leaders.It also doesn't help the credibility of his book that the image on the cover is the same image used to sell Rush's tea products. (An image that's a bit narcissistic at best). If this is designed to teach, as Limbaugh repeatedly claims, then it shouldn't be an advertisement.If you love Rush, then I ask that you approach the book with caution and understand what it is, a slightly biased, slightly egotistical, slightly stereotypical (at least against the Natives), and slightly inaccurate retelling of the events of the arrival of the Pilgrims. Just as you wouldn't want your hair dresser installing your catheter or your dentist landing a 747, perhaps Rush should stick at the job his excels at and not venture into a world best left to true children's historical writers .
If you are looking for a deep strategy game, look somewhere else. But if you want a simple to learn and fun to play game, then this dice game is worth the price.In Zooloretto Dice Game you are responsible for populating your zoo with various animals. These animals show up on the special dice you get with the game. The rules are simple. Roll the dice and then decide which dice go onto which trucks. Then, select which truck delivers animals to your zoo. Score points for animals you bring in, or tickets you sell, but don't overpopulate your zoo. That can lead to losing points.My 7 year old daughter loves this game. It's an excellent way to teach children a bit of strategy and planning .
delivery is so fast, good!!!I went road trip with this!!!but no protect film for lenses and screen...i thought the film was in package .
When I received this cross  the first thing I noticed was the detail, it is beautiful! The size and weight are perfect. One of the reviews I read noted that the back of the cross was &#34;hollow&#34;, I would say it was designed that way so the cross would not be to heavy and it would not be able to be showcased on the delicate yet sturdy chain that it came on. The cross is a nice solid piece...I love it .
Ordered these shorts in one size but, they did not have them in stock when they were filling my order...which happens sometimes, so they sent me an email, they were honest about the facts, offered me 3 or 4 different alternatives, we had some extremely prompt back and forth email dialog about the shorts in a different size and my order was filled. Honesty and Integrity in today's business world...What a breath of fresh air!! AND the best part Mike, the owner, is an Infantry Veteran who has taken his discipline and values from the military and brought them to this business he is supporting is family with...Just so everyone is clear...I DO NOT know Mike but, ELITE HERO is now in my book in more ways than one!!! KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK .
I expected to get what I paid for but, I got So much more, this skirt, as well as the two other items I ordered, were very generous in the sizing and I was truly amazed by the quality! One of the items I ordered, I didn't know how to enter the size but, I got an email early the next morning asking what size I needed and my order was shipped and received prior to the estimated delivery Amazon gave me...Thank you all, I am a 47 year old Mom of 3 (almost grown) girls, who's getting her sexy back and your site is now on my short list of must visits .
This dress is very cute on, runs long and the high side slits make it very sexy...not just for your pool side .
it took some tries but the old hard drive was eventually seen by the system, no fault of the C2G unit .
the item is working in my Laptop no problems so far, I hope this one lasts longer than the first one that came with the unit .
This is the second book of the Confectionatley Yours series that I have read, and I am quite pleased. Teaches on how to never give up, even at the hardest times, and takes the life of Hayley Hicks and turns it into something that girls want to read. It definitely fulfilled my expectations and I am looking forward to reading another Confectionatley Yours book .
I was very impressed by the results, K&N has manufactured a product that will not only save me money in fuel but also in replacement cost for air filters .
When I first bought my house in 2007. I hated the two colored gray and blue tiles in the bathroom due to plumbing repair prior to me buying the house not to mention the folding shower door. Yes apparently they made folding shower doors almost 60 years ago. So, I took down the shower door but I did not rip out the old tiles as they were in good shape. They don't make stuff like they used to and a bathroom renovation was not in my budget. I can only examine the cost of demolition of an old bathroom. My brother put this on the tiles which were about four feet or more up the walls of the entire bathroom and higher around the tub. It looks like a new bathroom.  The only difficult part was getting a smooth finish and coverage. He used a small roller at first that didn't give a smooth finish, but I had to buy another and there person at the home improvement store suggested covers that produce a smooth finish. I probably will order another kit, because as it dries you will see areas that don't have enough coverage and the touch kit is too small to cover those areas. Beware of the odor. It is very strong even after application for days. I had this done when my five year old was staying with Granny for winter break .
The mat is really cute but it is very then. I did not send it to preschool with my son because it is so thin. It is about as thick as a quilt and I think my mom makes her's very thick. I was expecting the actual mat inside with a cover. I just use it on his bed. It is not worth the price .
I used this piece to change out an old 40+ year old blank toggle cover. They do not sell this type of cover any more with the screws in the normal place of the toggle cover screws. It was easy to put in except the holes where the screws would go for the new toggle cover were not pre drilled. I had to screw the screws in the make room and the toggle cover doesn't fit as snuggly as a I like. The room looks better especially with matching toggle and outlet covers .
The bra is pretty but it offers little support due to the elastic shoulder straps. The cut of the bra does not give full coverage which causes a potential spill over effect .
I've used this product before and had excellent results. However, it does not kill the adult fleas the bite and if there's an infestion, you'll have to use several applications and other products to finally get rid of all the fleas .
I've used the product before with excellent results. This time it is taking longer than normal. Maybe I don't have enough roaches and am not putting enough out. It worked wonderfully when I used it at my father's apartment before he passed away. He was so sick that he couldn't clean his apartment and the roaches were out of control. When I came into town the first weekend and used the product, It killed about 75% of the roaches. Of course we cleaned the apartment which also helped. The next weekend about 90% of the roaches were gone. My mom loves the product and my second mom love the product. (I have to get it for everyone .
I had stray cats crawling under my house and fleas came inside the house. I had to use several different products inside and outside of the house for weeks to finally get them out of the house. Plus I had a neigher block off the entry points with chicken wire. I haven't had a problem since. I also check the crawl space under my house to see if they're squeezing through the blockade. I only used this product in the house, so I'm not sure how well it works alone and I had to use products almost daily for  a few days to break the flea cycle .
I love these furniture legs. I ordered the 7&#34; legs twice and the 8&#34; once. I bought this set for a new couch I bought for my father (elderly gentlemen with knee problems) I gave him my 8&#34; legs instead. He did not get a chance to enjoy the furniture legs, but my second mom now has the furniture in her house and she loves the extra height from the furniture legs. She's an overweight senior citizen with health and joint problems. It is much easier for her now to sit down and stand up from the furniture.  I have the furniture legs on my sofa in the living room and den as well as on the love set in my living room. All of my friends and family love the extra height of my furniture. (Of course, they're all big, tall or both usually both.). The only problem with the legs is to make sure the current furniture has the opening to screw the the legs in .
I ordered the download card when I first purchased a Leap Pad 2 for my son. The card was easy to use but you usually do not get as much savings using the download cards as opposed to downloading the apps from the Leap Frog site directly. Once you set up the tablets, you'll receive emails with discount codes. I wait to get a discount on the apps before I buy them. You can save 15% - 30%+ waiting for a sale that normally occurs at least once a month .
I bought this after my four year old broke this piece. I tried super glueing the piece back together, but it would break at the joint every time he pulled on the piece and not the door. It was a good fit. It seemed a little expensive for a plastic replacement part but it got the job done .
I am normally happy with Swiss Miss hot chocolate when it comes in the normal packets. However, the Keurig seems to water down the hot chocolate or they do not put enough mix in the cup. I would suggest brewing it on the smaller cup setting to get stronger hot chocolate .
My five year old son loves it. I bought this for Christmas a year ago. Unfortunately he broke the screen about the four months later and I had to buy another one. He plays with the tablet almost daily. I would suggest getting the rechargeable batteries and downloading th apps instead of the cartridges. I don't have to worry about him dropping the cartridges and breaking them. Plus it's easy to switch the downloaded apps to a new learning tablet .
Wonderful, thoughtful, and inspiring. A book you will not want to put down, and you will want to read more .
A great read!  Once you start this book, you cannot put it down.  David's strength is developing his characters into real life people whom you can actually visualize and understand. You'll have your favorite character - I have mine.  You can see the countryside, the small town, the river, the people and you can smell the smells, taste the food and get into the very thick of the plot .
This was a good book, definitely worth reading. I just wish the author hadn't switched so much between the past a present, made things a little confusing but once you get past that it has a good plot and character substance .
I definitely enjoyed this book. It was a good quick read, I would recommend. I HATE that Amazon has a requirement on how many words I have to use for my review. That's not necessary!Sometimes less is more .
I like this story because it wasn't just your run of the mill plot line, the author keeps you guessing and entertained. Plus there are definitely some really HOTT scenes in this one. Recommend .
The book story line was good but the ending was cut way too short. It doesn't even seem to be a set up for a sequel. I just prefer to have more to the story .
This is not built for a spotting scope. May be good for a small camera but is to weak for a spotting scope. Is light weight and easy to carry in a back pack but not stable enough for a large scope .
i was so excited for this item to come in. it looks great and the protection it gives while still being able to fit in my pocket is awesome, but it never goes on right. it will randomly lock or unlock my phone, and it ALWAYS messes up my volume. during calls, while in doctors offices, i just do not get it. my defender series before this never had issues, except for the fact that it started falling apart within 3 months .
I love it! I looked everywhere for this exact helmet, and I finally found it. It is awesome. I will never need another helmet .
While I am not familiar with Phillipa Gregory's novels, I took a chance on this series because of my interest  in this moment in history. I was hoping for something along the lines of &#34;Vikings&#34;----- a balanced mix of drama & action. But this is more like Downton Abbey in tights, heavy on the romance while all the action (the battles, anyway) takes place off-camera. This is definitely aimed at a female audience The political situation at the end of the Wars of the Roses was extremely complicated , but it seemed to be over-simplified, at least as it was presented in the first episode. I may or may not  take a chance on the second episode, to see if the aura of Romance sets the tone of the entire series .
Performs exactly as advertised. Smooth and responsive. I use it with my ASUS TF700 Transformer Pad tablet. No problems at all .
Looks nice and does a good job of protecting the tablet when I carry it around in a bag or rest it down on a hard surface. Quality seems good so far.The only issue I have is that the tablet does not fit snugly in the case so when I hold it upright in landscape orientation it slides down in the case and the bottom edge of the screen becomes blocked by the case which means the back, home symbols etc. are partially blocked and hard to press. Would suggest Velcro to secure the tab at the bottom as it slides out under the weight of the tablet allowing the tablet to move down .
This is my first tablet and it does not disappoint. Very smooth and quite fast. No stuttering except for a few apps I downloaded.Like the screen; sharp and bright except in bright daylight, but that's no surprise as this is the case with all tablets .
This tablet cannot handle heavy games regardless of GB. I'm returning it. Fake copy of nexus 7. Cheap alternatives of tablets are never good .
I am never disappointed with Reiker shoes.  They are best for people with severe feet issues. I am using an orthodic with this shoe but it provides some comfort even without my orthodic so that is generally the test for my money.  It is very comfortable and as the company boasts it has the Anti-stress abilities that other so-called comfortable shoes don't possess.I also love the classy styling.  It's hard to find attractive shoes when you have foot and walking problems.Thank you Rieker .
This Jambu sandal is a good option for those who need support or have difficulty with backless sandals. The base cups your heel so no slipage and the straps keep you from pronating also.The toe box is a little cramped if you need to add orhtodics.  Without orthodicts it is sufficient .
I have special issues so for me it's just ok.  With an orthodic insert it is working better.  The shoe has a flat sole (bottom) which is not good for my walking issue .
The fit was too narrow for size.  Sole was not very supportive. Overall also did not like the look of the shoe .
This shoe its and looks great.  Great for a little more dressed up look and very comfortable because I can't wear hi-heels .
I love how this show feels in the footbed and the impact cushion of the sole construction, but the shoe was way too big in my usual size and is very fashionable. Unfortunately their are none left to order in a smaller size .
Very comfortable, and good for those really hot days because it's a very strappy sandal but with good support. This sandal compares to the Teva with the same strap design only this is a little more dress up not just for outdoor recreation .
This is a great unit.  I only wish it had been about 5 inches taller.  Although nothing replaces a &#34;real&#34; fire.  This is pretty cute and the heat can be well controlled with the remote. The wood color is beautiful (as pictured .
I try two or three time , but it still puff up after over night it look does not air tight .
Enjoyed watching Jennifer and Rutger in their youth. Like the wardrobe, timeplace and scenery. Will not recomend for people under 17 yrs of age. Violent for its time .
It kept me watching, decent action adventure, not many &#34;bad words&#34;.Would recomend for ages 13 and up.I like the special efects, and of course ewan macgregor is one of my favorite british actors .
Good laughs, but same old thing if you are into celebrity gossip. It's like she does not have any imagination for funny material, but then again that is her mo. The &#34;D&#34; list stuff. Not family material .
Very hard to believe, but oh well, is a nice quaint love story, cute. Adults viewers only. Teenagers will never get it .
Do not know what they where going for, but was not artistic! Ugly costumes, poor dialog. Do not waste your time, and forget Matt Dallas (Kyle XY), here is not that young man some actually liked. His performance tanked! Not for people under 17yrs. Not a family movie .
The story is lame, very little dancing, too much bla, bla, lost interest in the movie, only two guys are good looking (Mat B and Channing the rest very ugly!!! :( Adults only (DO NOT recomend .
This book talks about a half-blood (a child of a God and a mortal) Percy Jackson's adventures. I thought this was a great book! I now know a bunch of Greek Gods I diddn't know about.P.S. sorry for any spelling (if there are any .
An absolute must to save gas and add horsepower. You will feel the added power the minute you take off with this filter. It is that good. Fits exactly like the original and takes just a few minutes to install. No more power robbing paper filters that are over priced and they end up in a landfill in 10,000 miles .
Quality is good and it looks exactly like the original except it fits a little loose. The clips are a bit different but not a big issue. It does come with the bulbs and sockets and the price is cheaper than a recycled part at a junk yard if you can even find one .
Exact replacement for the Kenmore filter that our refrigerator uses. You can't tell the difference from the OEM part and is a lot less money than the part sold by Sears. This is a no brainer. Save your money and buy these instead .
Good protection when comes to water and dropping the  phone. But can't talk with the case on the phone, so if you can't talk with the case on the phone,  what do you want it for?  I don't recommend it.Order it in a color, got something different .
I tried different types of Shea Butter, this is the Best of the Best! Don't doubt it, try it!  You will not regret it .
The only problem I have is that I preorded this and did not find the blimp code, it wasn't emailed or in the case. So if someone could fix that it'd be awesome .
I was missing pieces so I am not able to put it together. This was a christmas present to my boyfriend so i was upset .
The book Comforting Children in Crisis was written by Group Publishing Company to serve as a tool in helping every professional who interacts with kids to know what to do in any given situation where a kid is considered in a crisis situation. The sections are organized into a short anecdote and followed by differing tips, depending on the person that tip section is meant for. This method of organization is easy to understand, and makes most sections easy to find.This book has some issues, such as attempting to address everything conceivable that could happen to a kid, instead of focusing on principles. The attempt to deal with twelve different topics in under two-hundred pages makes the book seem more like a list of tips or to dos than a helpful resource. The tips themselves are good, if repetitive at times, but take up more space than anything that is likely to help a person understand the given situation and what they need to do about it, other than a short list of what to say and what not to say and one or two ways to help. Granted, this book is written for the general public, but the differing sections of tips for counselors and other professionals seems almost excessive. Also, it just tries to make things into a cookie-cutter list of actions instead of principles to employ, and is less flexible than would be desired for a usable tool.The negative side being dealt with, this book is an excellent quick-reference guide for anyone who has no clue what to do, and has some good ways to do triage on a kid to figure out who they need to talk to. The main use for this book would be to both remember some guidelines about what&#8217;s happening, and also to give the worker a refresher on each item being addressed. That is what I think of Comforting Children in Crisis .
Lip sync off-movie had to keep reloading-Not a good experience-Have found that the &#34;Free&#34; movies all have this issue.Not real happy with the Prime Video .
Movie would not load--Was finally able to watch beginning to end after a lot of frustration.  Not sure about the money I have paid for the Prime .
It's too see through, the top is perfect but the bottoms you can see your butt cheeks, would not recommend it .
I love my new gumdrop cases for my I pad and Iphone. It protects the equpment like nothing I have used before .
There good but just not for the thickness of my hair... I can still wear them but I just need ones that match my course hair .
Daria is just the icon of sardonic irony . Her ethically uncompromising ethos , wry wit and glorification of the intellectual is still novel as amusing today as it was when I was in high school.  Only a philistine wouldn't like this show .
Mozart in the Jungle hits all the right notes and plays me like a fool. Simply cannot wait for the second act .The only thing more beautiful than the music is the acting. BRAVO .
A very well structured book. It is not only a good book on Java Threading, it is also an example for all others to follow when writing about programming, or indeed any other subject. The examples are very short, but packed with wisdom. Buy this book .
Amazing!!! Love this series!! Must read, you won't be disappointed!! I love Layla, Blake and Axelle!!  So happy Jonah and Raven are back too .
My old one stopped sticking to windshield. This one works great and stays on my windshield and doesn't wobble around .
I have owned one of these before and really liked it. My previous one had fallen in toilet and got ruined. Great sound quality. I can hear callers perfectly and they can hear me. I love that I can hear the callers # thru my headset and voice call by the push of a button. only wish it would say my contacts name but it doesn't do it for android 2.3 or higher. Other than that it's great .
bough this cord along with kurio cord and they both are crappy. they won't keep a connection. have to keep jigling cord and even thn it wont charge fully .
I bought these to go with my Bluetooth headset in case the original one broke. Fortunately I haven't had to use them yet but it's good to have them on hand .
I haven't tried this for wine stains yet but it works the best on coffee and tea stains.  Even if you use cream in your coffee or tea, Carbona stain devils always get out the stain .
Very thin and not as long as the photos :( After waiting over a month to receive this week I was very disappointed with the quality and length .
Very thin and not as long as the photos :( After waiting over a month to receive this week I was very disappointed with the quality and length. I will never wear this wig .
I love this mousepad, it's not very comfortable on my wrist.. but still looks awesome .
This is a great quality wig, however it is a much lighter shade of red than in the photos.. also the ends are wavy with no curls .
I LOVE this bracelet, I received it promptly however I wore this for no more than 30 minutes and the lace detached from the bracket :( I had to stitch and super glue it back together. It was salvageable and for that I am grateful .
This is my absolute favorite wig! I have purchased maybe 20 in the last couple months and this was the best quality! The shade of red is beautiful! The photos honestly don't do it justice, the ends are more curly (which I love!) I plan to buy this same one again once I wear-out the one I recently received :P .
Stretch the material. These boots are high quality and did not rip even a single thread as I pulled and stretched them for my wife. I'm 6`1 270 and can pull relatively hard. I honestly would have expected any pair of boots to be destroyed by the stretching but they held up. I really wanted to see these on my wife, and it was worth the effort. Stretch `em before you return `em .
I ordered this for Christmas for my wife because she's wanted a shoe rack for quite a while now. When she opened it, she found that there were multiple large pressure fractures in the frame which would eventually lead to a very broken shoe rack. I arranged for Amazon to replace the item, which they did promptly. However, when the replacement arrived, I was quite upset to find that the same pressure fractures were present (and were actually worse than the first time).I do not recommend this as a purchase for someone that intends to give it away as a gift or for someone that has an immediate need. So far I've sent one back and am waiting for Amazon to pick up the second and replace it again. I'm sure I'll receive one that's worth keeping eventually, but so much for a Christmas gift for the wife...If I receive a third version that is cracked, damaged, or unusable, I will simply request a refund. I'm not going to continue wasting my time if there is no quality standard on this item.Stay away from this one .
Guardian in training Rose Hathaway had been on the run with her best friend, and moroi princess, Lissa Dragomir for 2 years when they are finally caught and returned to their school St. Vladimir's Academy.Upon arrival they are escorted to headmistress Kirova's office where is decided they will both continue their enrollment at said school.Rose must balance her life when others try and knock her down while struggling to learn to control her bond with Lissa.I LOVED the Vampire Academy series. All 6 books. They are by far my favorite books in all time followed closely by The Bloodlines series. I am not an english teacher and am quite rubbish at writing to be honest so I wouldn't be able to critique her writing style but I absolutely love these books .
Makes me wish I had a monkey. Not to blow up with a coconut, just have around. Also makes me wish I could've worked in more places instead of just the Gulf of Mexico .
i didn't really expect it to be like this rubber comes out easily, but it works great! for the price you pay .
I was going to buy the longines, but decided on this one at the last minute and love it.  Not too big and not too small.  Very well made and I just can't fault it.  I think anyone who buys it will be very happy .
dissappointed....... fragrance does not linger for long eventhough it states that it is perfume!!.... Don't think that I would purchase it again .
This item does not work and I cannot return it.  Do NOT buy this item!  Why are so many words required in the review when all is needed are: Do Not Buy This .
number very small, the glass brocken just with a littel hit even in not shap object. to change the date is very diffucult ect .
I bought this cologne for $13 at 3.4oz. Let me tell you, a great buy on my part. I get so many compliments from girls who I don't even know. Makes me wish I would have bought this cologne sooner .
If you liked the Halo series you're probably gonna like this one too. Personally, I didn't like the changes to the multiplayer. It's something new, which is good to have... but I think they should go back to the old Halo play style for future releases, because we all know Halo 4 isn't the last Halo. Microsoft wouldn't let that happen .
I LIKE IT BUT WONT USE IT CAUSE IT DONT HAVE THE FRONT TO IT,IT ONLY HAS THE BACK SO I GAVE IT TO A FRIEND .
Did not come with Power Cord.  Power cord is needed for constant projection to work. Set up is fairly easy with the instructions .
Works well to protect phone, but doesn't cover the face plate at all. Has good feel to it! Bright color you won't lose it .
I can't really write much of a review because I ended up with not enough money to buy a mic, I'm currently using a webcam mic with a pop filter -_-On the bright side, I still can hear a difference. I think it's a good buy for anyone with a real microphone .
Be VERY careful when buying this product. Please read the rest of my view if you&#8217;re considering of switching to a 4.A little about myself to understand clearly:I've been playing since 5th grade. Ive been section leader and 1st chair for 2 years. Currently a senior in high school.Review:These reeds are EXTREMELY hard to play at first. After my first practice, I was physically exhausted from trying to play. At the time, I could not even play a low D. Gradually I have been adapting to the reeds but they take A LOT of air.Pro:They play a lot louder. (It's probably because it's forcing you to push more air than usual, but still)Articulation is easierDynamics are easierCons:Physically exhausting the first couple of timesRequires a lot more air (This is actually a pro)Very hard to play lower notes (Still working on anything below a low C)A little more difficult to play quieter (Not very noticeable)Conclusion:Don't buy these reeds. If you&#8217;re still in high school, buy a 3 or maybe a 3.5 if you&#8217;re really wanting to switch. I love Vandoren but #4 reeds are a little overkill .
I hooked it up to my Asus vh236h and it transmitted Audio to my receiver. This is the thing people must know though,IMPORTANT!Toslink/Optical cables DO NOT carry true surround sound audio. They were made to carry Dolby Digital and DTS.Therefore, if your audio transmitting device (Such as: SoundCard, TV or DVD Player) does not support either of these formats, this cable will transmit in PCM 2.0. That means you will only get sound out of 2 of your speakers .

Right out of the box I could tell I would like this product. I came from a Logitech M100, a standard computer mouse with 1000 dpi. Right after I plugged it into the computer, the mouse flew across the screen and I was amazed. I now run at about 3300 dpi.Pro:More dpi than I would ever needSoftware is very nice. Alot of ways to program your mouseCan turn of LEDs if you want (Can also auto turn off when the screen shuts off)Amazing feel for palm gripCons:Packaging had almost no wear, but there was just a tad. Not a big deal, it's hardly noticeable and doesn&#8217;t effect the mouse at all .
There's not much to say, the case has done a good job. My iPad has no scratches or anything wrong with it .
Did not get to finish the book. Wish I had.Would like to read more of the mystery and suspense books again .
I found it to be very creepy and I don't think I would recommend it to anyone.  Too close to reality for me .
I was highly disappointed when I received this book.. What I ve being paid for the purchases of this book.. It's almost same price for new book jus $1 or $2 compared! But to my surprise, the book was so dirty, torn and worn.. It doesn't what amount being for .
I believe this is a pretty good crochet book.I have not tried any of the items to crochet but it looks fine .
Part of the Davao won't stay on the wall. I like it, but disappointed it won't stay on the wall .
I really love this book. It is sad and pulls at your heart easy. This book really caught my eye and I actually read it when i was pregnant. Now I'm against abortions and stuff like that but this book really touched touched me. I was so drawn into it I couldn't put it down .
First couple of pages I didn't think no would  get through this book but then I got so into it an  I didn't want to put it down. It made my heart swell and I just love  everything about  it. This  book is.  Keeper for sure for any girl that loves love stories. It's about commitment, denial, heart ache and of course love .
I choose 4 stars because I thought this was a good book. There was always something going on and the emotions in this book really stood out. Everything came together so it all made sense and makes it a easy choice to read the second book. So much goes on that it doesn't get boring, every chapter holds a different problem .
I bought the micro loop extensions and trust me when I say this is the ONLY brush you can use on them! If you try to use a regular brush, the first time you try it, it will snag and either rip it out or feel like its pulling it out!! This brush lets you brush right through the extensions without cause damage and it does not hurt. Buying this brush will be the best thing you spend money on when buy extensions. This is a must have .
we gave this to my son for his first birthday, the big one, and he seems to really like it. he is learning  that if he hits the  hands it will make noise an  he LOVES music. he dances with it and likes to hit it a lot. I think it's great for little kids. it has been dropped on tile a few times an stomped on by a 4year old and it still works fine. we haven't tried the rolling feature yet though .
I bought the conditioner and shampoo because on the bottle it says it works great on hair extensions. For me these did NOT do good for my extensions. I had real hair in and when I used these it dried them out and made them feel really terrible. it was really bad. lesson I learned, just because it says you can use extensions doesn't mean you can. If your looking for stuff more for extensions try Suave, its the best .
We just got a new matress and had to have something to cover it because lets admit nothing is more gross than sleeping on a disgusting looking matress at night and its not very romantic either... Well being the poor people we are we thought we would buy this cheap cover. Now we have a 1&1/2 year old boy that LOVES to spill everything and be messy like every other two year old. This matress cover keeps your matress clean BUT so can a tarp. You might as well put a tarp on your mattress because it would cost the same, feel the same, and sound the same. It is super noisy....(if you didn't get that by now) at first we were like oh its no problem but after 6 months of dealing with it well its getting pretty annoying. we tried putting 6 quilts between us and the matress and its just as loud as before. it is soooo bad. if you even shift in bed the other person gets woken up. if you get up at night the other person gets woken up. I can hear my husband roll around in bed when im watching tv in the other room (we live in a apartment) honestly just save more money and get the kind that isnt plastic .
I love this bag it is really cute, i don't really like the orange inside but i knew that is how it came and that is my personal opinion. I gave it 4 stars because i wish it came with more pockets. It has no pockets on the outside and the ones on the inside are really tiny. I ended up using this bag as my new diaper bag lol .
I put this on my LG phone and at first I thought it would be  another cheap phone case but it looks durable and nice. when I got it I snapped it on and I don't have any complaints. I can take it off without braking it. plus I have a one year old that loves to throw it, drop it, and eat it. it has protected my phone  an  the case hasn't come off from any of those things. very happy with this product .
Can I start by saying I LOVE these extensions. They are really cute!! I loved them so much I bought more sets of these and I do them in peoples hair at boutiques and events!! I have not had one single complaint about them at all. They work for all hair types, hair colors, and hair lengths. plus they are cute for all ages, not just teens. I have put them in toddler girls hair for pictures, teens hair, babys for pictures, even moms that just want a edgy young vibrant look (im one of them). I love these extensions and will ways be purchasing from these guys .
I was disappointed when we bought this. My husband bought it for me for Christmas and he bought it with my kindle fire hd so I could. Buy my Amazon Prime account and but when  we tried to it charged our account and we found out you can't use a gift card for that. When you order a gift card it says you can use it with any purchase .
I love this case. It is great and works well with protecting my kindle. It doesn't look cheap and the leather feels great in your hands. Now it won't let you close it and charge it and it sucks to read with it on because it's awkward but you figure out what works good for you .
I didn't like these at all. I spent an hour on one screen trying to get it on but no matter what there was bubbles in it. I spent hours trying to stick them on and bubbles, bubbles, bubbles. It was a waste of money and you can't even get your money back. Total waste of time. I'm VERY disappointed .
I think this book is defiantly worth reading. It is very wordy and you won't want to put it down .
When I bought my kindle  I downloaded this free manual an  it helped me  learn things. Like I would of never figured out how to take screen shots an  stuff without  it .
It is really good milk my baby like it a lot. No constipation at all only a lot of gas but other than that it is a pretty good milk .
First of all, I supposed to get 3 in 1 but I only get the fish eye and lens I never get the micro lens . So I rate this for 3/5 but it doesn't mean I didn't like it. I like/love but if I have the micro lens then ill be more happier. But thanks  though .
This tripod is complete junk. It is poorly made and did not work as needed. The tabs to push into ground bent in soft soil. Also the connection to the level broke off after 3 times of using the tripod. I would not recommend this item to anyone .
I am returning 3 of the 4 plaques I ordered.  The Plexi glass was broken on 3 of the 4 plaques that I bought.  DO NOT ORDER .
I did not finish reading the book. Would love to get another book from kindle library but can't till I submit a sixteen word opinion .
This Bible is absolutely AWESOME! Never before have I looked at scriptural characters from this deep of a perspective. This Bible was made for me. Thank you.Justin A. Tripon .
I liked this movie not sure why it got so many bad reviews i guess to each there own. I like twisted movies there creative different from the status quo, i guess you will love it or hate it .
uNu sent me a FREE case for review and believe me, I could not be any happier! I am glad I had the opportunity to participate in the UTry program.The uNu Dx protective case provides full convenience, allowing for an extra full charge of your iPhone, at the same time providing the durability and quality that protects the iPhone 5. The case itself comes in three different colors: white, black, and red. The finishing on the case is a nice a matte, that allows for a smooth and firm grip. It is form-fitted for the iPhone 5 and has cut-outs of all of the ports for easy access.The case provides a 2300 mAh battery, allowing for an extra 100-110% charge. One of the key features of this case is that while charging your phone, it charges the case at the same time. The case also enables syncing, alleviating the problem of taking off the case every time you need to sync onto itunes.In the box, it comes with the case, screen protector, and adaptable headphone jack. The adaptable headphone jack is required for even the use of apple earphones because of how deep the case protrudes from the headphone jack. After using the case for 3 days, I am VERY impressed on the quality of the product. I fulled used all of the battery on my iPhone, and the case still managed to charge it back to 100%. The case does add bulk, but I think this only makes the phone easier to hold. I would fully recommend this case to anyone wanting a quality battery case, that also protects the phone. The only problem that I came across when using the case was that their was NO protrusion from the iPhone screen and the case, so if you face the screen on a table, it would touch the surface. Overall, the case is built great and is a recommended buy!Pros:charges an extra 100-110%durable/protectivevariety of colorscase charges and sync without removal.Great matte finishCons:No protrusion of case to screenAdaptable headphone jack required .
I dig piano music. Working an a coffee shop like I do, I get to hear a lot of it. This song popped up on our music system, and I just HAD to have it! So I did a quick online search, and lo and behold; the only place to find an uncorrupted copy was Amazon.com .
I only download music I like, so of course I'm gonna give any song I have 5 stars. Wouldn't you .
I played the actual card game for a while and was hoping to reconstruct an old favorite deck to see how it would stand up in the ratings. However, this piece of crap app demands that you have a Facebook profile and that you &quot;become a fan&quot; to get more content (which I have discovered to be the card database).I don't have a Facebook account, nor do I want a Facebook account. If I could speak to the developer of this sh***y app, I'd tell him exactly what he can do with it.I'm very honest about my ratings; I don't say something is good when it isn't. Giving this app 1 star is actually giving it more than it's due. If you're reading this and have ANY common sense, take my advice: look somewhere else .
This is one of the dictionaries that is compatible with Office Suite Pro 6. It also happenes to be the most comprehensive of the offerings, with over 160,000 entries. If you get OSP6, then this is the perfect dictionary to have(you'll probably never see those annoying little red lines while typing again .
I downloaded the free version from here (which turned out to be an older version); after the program updated itself through the developers' site, I found that even though it's nowhere close to Microsoft Office (it won't even change fonts like the online user's guide shows, nor will it let me print anything for some reason) the interface is decent and there's not a lot of clutter on the screen. The main problem I found is that to have the truest professional version of this program you have to  BUY the Windows-compatible suite (at 50 or roughly $120!) Let's face it, shall we? If we wanted to spend that kind of money, we wouldn't be looking at freeware, now would we .
I'm a bit skeptical when it comes to the apps I purchase, and this app was no different. However, it did function as promised and &quot;immediately&quot; coverted a song I had that I couldn't listen to to a format that my Android tablet understood. I just wish it could have been a stand-alone on-tablet app instead of an upload/download kind of thing .
This is just the coolest little gadget!Very sleek and gets a lot of attention. I don't mind the attention since I love promoting products that I like. Helping me to lose weight and doubles as a watch (which is great so I don't have to pull my phone out to check the time when I am exercising). If I want to hide it, there is a magnetic feature where I can put it a non-obvious place. Im excited to have a product that helps me understand my sleep and activity levels. I love the topaz color and it looks great with the tan/leather watch band that I also purchased. Overall its very versatile and a great product. Would definitely recommend for someone who is trying to get back into shape or concerned with their health. Another thing I was really pleased with is that the customer support got back to me on a sunday night! (just had some questions .
It warms of the room real well, I would reccomend it. The only bad thing about it is that the fan speed one and two are the same it doesn't change but it is not really needed .
High quality, box just a little scratched from shipping. Great product though I really like them good color, wonderful. Id get them and I already did haha. I don't really know what else to say I just need more words for it to submit .
Bueno el Producto, solo que es dif&iacute;cil Rastrear el Producto, aunque me costo lo mismo el Envi&oacute; y el Producto Vale la Pena,  Claro el Producto no era para mi era para mi hija .
this little thing is amazing, connect easily, load voice and can work as a charger. u can't go wrong with the price .
Couldn't put it down, I will definitely be reading her other books! I have recommended this book to all of my friends .
A friend recommended this book to me and once I started it I could not put it down! The author has a way of making you feel like you are in the story. All my friends are now reading it and they love it just as much as I did! I hope the author will write more novels in the future, I will definitely read them .
So my old wedding ring was sterling silver and i haven't had it but a yr and a half but you would think i had it 30 yrs. So i decided to order this ring because its supposed to be highly durable. I ordered Fri Feb 21 and i got today Mon Feb 24 so not only is it here early but its true to size and its gorgeous i am in love. Im anxious to see if it holds quality after i shower clean etc. I will be getting back for an update. But my ring is just stunning. And a great price i will never buy sterling silver again .
This is an attractive keyboard cover that fits very well and protects the keys as well as expected.  The problem is that the top row of keys - the half-height function keys - are mislabeled.  I don't use those keys very often so it's not a huge problem for me but that seems to be a very significant flaw in a keyboard cover .
Dropped it a few times but still hasn't broken. Solid and sturdy .
Love this tube. It is good for starters and the ribbing is perfect, not too intense but not too light either. Great to get started with. Cleans easily and smells good. Highly recommended toy for personal fun .
I have been taking this for a month now and I have noticed a significant change in my appetite patterns after starting to take 2 pills daily. Also energy levels have increased. So far so good .
I'm happy with this purchase. The coconut oil is very light, and not very dense and greasy as other brands. Also the smell is very subtle. My problem with other coconut oils were the smell was too strong.So yea this is good for both cooking or personal use on the body .
I didn't think I would like the system and then I realized it was created just for me.  From start to finish I learned the steps and began to lose inches just by utilizing the introduction.  Frankly, I didn't think I could move at their pace but I hang in there with a fresh bottle of water and towels cause you will work up a good sweat .
If you are or are not confident in your job search Work with Recruiters Effectively is the book for you .
Like others have said - after about 2 months of use, the fabric has started to peel off. Not worth the money, I already need to buy a new case .
Grow light functions as advertised to date, and was delivered on time with no visible defects.  I would buy this light again if i need another .
The game will last you about 4 hours from start to finish;the story never really made since and the customization on cars was crap. If you want to good racing game get Test Drive Unlimited 2, although not perfect I loved every minute of it .
If you enjoy downton abbey or fictional historical stories you will relish this book which gives an insight into how the Great War affected families and society. A fantastic story you will not be able to put this book down .
I saw this movie in theaters, and when I saw this film I didn't know anything about this movie other then that James Franco is in it.Now I think that James Franco is a great actor, but this movie without a doubt knocked him down a peg in my opinion. The movie starts with a horrible story and 5 characters that you can't help but hate. They all complain and they are just irritating and are the kind of people that make me give up on people today. This movie constantly repeats the same thing through the movie. For example they will say something and they will immediately replay it over and over another 2 or 3 times for God knows why, but I know it's incredibly irritating. This movie constantly repeats James Franco's incredibly stupid saying Spring Break, Spring break, Spring break Forever. And this is said more times then the number of times you wish the movie would end. There are not enough words to describe how much I hate this movie. I just don't get how some people enjoyed this. And I'm not bashing it because I have high movie standards. I have seen many bad but enjoyable movies, however Spring Breakers is not enjoyable in any way. It is so bad I am stunned I didn't walk out of this movie. But I gave it the benefit of the doubt and sat through this what felt like a forever long movie and thought something would happen that would redeem it. But nothing happened the ending is just as bad as the rest of this damn movie. And it ends with them repeating the same thing they do throughout the entire movie. I believe it is my destiny to warn people about this movie and save them the 94 minutes of there life that I will sadly never get back. Giving this movie one star is being to generous and it sickens me to give it that .
I really enjoy the cake pan i like that it doesn't stick to the pan. The only negative thing about the pan that i didnt like was my cakes came out really big if you want a smaller round cake i suggest using a little battee in the pan .
I bought this for my wife for Christmas.It had been recommended to her,but it was difficult to obtain seconhand in U.K. She hasn't read it yet,but is looking forward so to doing.I was pleased with the rapid service and Quality of packing .
Made by weak materials (hook made by plastic), not resilient at all.My stong advice is to not use that thing to hold a laptop case .
Not only &#34;Barilla&#34; is a premium brand for italian products, also this flour is the one you need to use if you are preparing Italina recipes (or pizza .
I read that some people had problems with the headset when they first got it and so far I haven't had any, definitely better than my old turtle beach. I really like the way the cord is made, feels rugged and it has good length .
While I'm not a computer junkie take my review with a grain of salt, it does the job and has some nice features like the Guru that comes with the CD, haven't messed with it since I don't know a whole lot about it, but so far it runs  games amazingly .
I had been trying to find this book for ages! No where in town does anyone carry it, so I was very please not only to have found it for a great price but also for it to have been shipped on time! I really appreciate that :D .
I ordered these and they never grew...I did everything I was told...but nothing grew :( I had seriously looked forward to growing these in our garden but somethings just aren't meant to be i suppose .
I ordered it thinking it would be blue...but I suppose I just didn't read the whole description and it's black/dark-purple. So, that is really my only problem, and that is pretty much my fault...but if you guys either do have it in blue or get it in blue...cause I just like blue and black together...I'd like to order a new case from ya then. It holds up really well. It's a nice strong sturdy case and the price is pretty awesome too .
I love this, one because of the price and two how well it seems to work. My only problems is that the buttons aren't like those on BMW main manufacture key fobs. They tend to stick a little bit...but all in all I am happy with it .
I bought the case for a friend, as this was her first touch screen phone...and as she's like me in a few ways...she drops her phone quite often. It arrived either the day of the estimated delivery date...or the next day...either way it got there in less than a week, which is awesome, because I was told it would be a weeks time when I ordered a product and it didn't show for months. Over all we're very happy with the case :) We chose this one in particular because it came with a screen protector,,,now I just wish I could find one for me phone .
Was dissapointed with it,was expecting better results. Try different amount nothing seam to work any better so overall not satisified .
Moringa leaf capsules , I have been take them for 1 month and haven't seen any be difference in them so far,will continue to take see if gets better  performance .
Not spectacular enough to look through more than once or twice. High priced for what we got. Cute pictures though .
This could have been spectacular but there is no-one narrating through the entire 1 1/2 hrs.Therefore, we don't know what we're seeing in alot of cases.Especially hotels.How are we supposed to do research and stay there if we're not given information? Don't bother renting....specials on TV are better .
Between the young girl in this and Naomi Judds bad acting I couldn't watch more than a 1/2 hr. Andy Griffith did ok. Really bad and totally predictable .
I am thrilled I discovered these.There is no caomparison to the &#34;others&#34; that call themselves healthy bars.All flavors are wonderful .
I had never tried a Mally product before because everything is way to pricey.I bought this and itis no better than a $10 primer I have .
I wanted to try these and compare to the Kind bar.While the flavor is ok they are not as satisfying or a big.I would not buy these again .
While queen was a fabulous group and Paul Rodgers has a one of a kind voice, this cd is not great. The sound quality is garbled.. From beginning to end 3/4 of the music barely heard due to fans screaming, clapping etc. Without that background mess it would have been very cool .
We have ordered 3 inexpensive phone cases from Amazon. None of them have fit. Pay more and maybe you'll get a better quality .
I looked EVERYWHERE for a night light bulb that would give off a soft, beautiful glisten. I bought a box of 25. These are beyond perfect. They look orange but once plugged in give the nice color you'll love. Not too harsh .
I love unsulphered apricots.I have never found any better than the Trader Joes brand.I thought I'd try these and I hate everything about them.From flavor, thickness, not chewy enough........... Don't bother with these .
I bought the black one too. This buy was excellent.  Nothing  about it is cheap.Designer purses like this can run in the hundreds of dollars. This was an excellent buy .
One of the best CDs I've ever bought, just a pity I won't be seeing them playing live in Australia anytime soon .
Making every experience count, learning patience, accessing our incredible strengths and finding the humor in the daunting tasks of life are few of the lessons I am learning from Being My Mom's Mom. TRULY it is a guide book for those who find themselves on this journey of elder family care. There are books and seminars and classes and brochures, but NONE more human and heart-warming than Being My Mom's Mom. This is life and HOW we deal with our paths truly determines our destination.Loretta sits down with us, makes us cry, self-examine and laugh. Like the warmth of the most awesome cup of tea, she chronicles how she has chosen this path of dealing with Dementia all the while challenging us to see life's rolelrcoaster through a different lens and re-value the seemingly mundane.Read it once to cry and laugh, once to help remember the lessons in pain and once to highlight all of the wonderful gems of wisdom she shares. Expect to learn about and embrace....change .
I haven't yet been able to actually use the guide but I received it very promptly and am looking forward to using it on a upcoming trip.  I also like the fact that is is small, laminated, and can be put inside a pocket easily.  Looking forward to using it .
Like most people as they age, I have marionette lines around the mouth and nose area.  I have chosen not to use fillers or to have surgery so am always looking for products that will enhance my almost 71 years old skin.  This product is excellent!  It has greatly diminished the lines around my mouth and actually lifted and minimized those around my nose area.  It is expensive but well worth the price.  I'm on my third bottle now and, on my skin, it is nothing short of miraculous .
This cookbook is definitely a five star purchase, the recipes are super easy, using affordable and easy to find ingredients and the outcome is amazing tasting food.  I use this cookbook every other day and the Caramel Slice recipe is to die for, you will not regret purchasing Hungry Tums cook book .
Absolutely loved this. Dropped phone and didn't break . Yay!  Loved the prop on back. I have a two year old grandson who I let watch netflex on phone... so tough cover till he rung the prong off. :) he is a strong little fellor .
Love the protection with this. Having to get use to opening phone to text. GREAT that you can anwser phone and look at time when closed. Could be a little more economical.  Almost ordered wrong one cause video played for one with no cover so not sure whats up with that. Why show a video of one cover on link that is not the same cover .
I absolutely loved this when I put it on my phone. It was very neat. Looked very nice. Came in handy having a mirror. I live in tn and it was still winter when I got it. However I just got back from sunny florida  and while there I had to take it off my phone because in the bright sun I could not see my phone when on like when in tn. Hope they come up with one that works as well in bright sun .
Love the color and quality of this cover. I almost did not get it cause I read a review that it did not fit someones samsung galaxy 10.1. They must not have known what size thier tablet was cause it fits mine perfectly. Great price. I seen same  one at officemax only available in black $98.00 and at walmart only available in black $58.00. So I am very happy with mine .
Fit perfect on my HK, it was just right, not to tight or to loose. It only took a couple days to get it .
I got 2 of these one for my 308 and one 223, had no problems installing what so ever. The key is to push the roll pin out just enough to get your old latch out. I used an old o-ring pick to push the roll pin out just enough to get my old latch out .
Couldn't be happier. It meets my expectations and then some. It looks and sounds great. I like that it has 3 HDMI ports. I watch movies and play video games on it just fine. It's obviously not going to blow you away, but you would've spent several hundreds more if you wanted it to .
Fantastic book! Very well written, not a lot of cheesiness (IMO). In this genre, there seems to be a lot of one character being just OBSESSED with another - to a scary degree. This book didn't have that, which was a refreshing change. I recommend this entire series. You won't be disappointed .
Im not about the spoilers. K Bromberg's Driven Trilogy - just read it, you won't be sorry. Plot - check. Romance - check. Steaminess - check. Angst, Heat - check & check. Seriously. Read it .
This book - this series - I can't even put into words how much I enjoyed reading it. Throughout the entire trilogy, there was never a moment that I considered abandoning it. Never a moment where I rolled my eyes because it was 'cheesy' or obvious. The author did a great job keeping the story interesting and 'even' - the final book, Crashed, seemed to have the most activity, but it flowed with the previous two books flawlessly. Of all the series & trilogies I have read, I have to say the Driven Trilogy is my absolute favorite. Read it. Seriously. Five stars all the way .
It's a good choice for hot beverages but not too safe because the movements it spills out if its full .
I bought this for my boyfriend. First it arrived late in a cheap box with nothing but a very small plastic brush. It shows on the box that you can use it wet or dry. The first time he used it dry he got small pimples all over his neck and face. The second time he used it wet he got a huge rash on his face. He opened it to clean it out and all the pieces fell out. This is a horrible product and not worth the money I spent. I am so disappointed in this product. I wish I was able to return it and get my money back. I have now learned my lesson on buying these items online. I do not recommend this product to anyone. Very cheap product .
Private arrangement is my favorite Brenda Jackson book yet.  I read this book in a few hours because I could not put it down(maybe because I want to live the life I read about).  Great job and great ending .
I was always disappointed with the short cord that came with my phone.  I never realized the longer cords were out there.  This one matches the gel cover on my phone perfectly!  And - I can actually put the phone on the table while it charges, instead of under it .
Although it wasn't what I had thought I ordered but it went beyond my expectations. I love the fact that it is a sensory type of book .
Fabric was the exact print of what I was looking for. Although the description says it was cotton, it was more like a lcanvas n a rough material, so that was a little misleading. It was sufficient for the project I needed it for but had I been makin something else wouldn't have work since it was more like a canvas than cotton .
I am very happy with my purchase , delivered on time , despite of other reviewer I got the new one, not the used one, the mixie is definitely yes for the indian kitchen , I used many other blender, grinder which we get in USA but not useful for making chutni , batter etc, I will say don't waste money for other blender/magic bullet kindda stuff if u hold the indian kitchen , this is the best .
This brush is for dolls. Did not know it was small. Would not have bought them if I knew they were this small .
This book helped very little. Not everybody would like to build just Egyptian stuff. Why not try making a book with mixed amounts of every type of building that is free .
I love the book , just like the others ,I read them in a day...the was so good...can't wait for the next one to come out .
I didn't get to use it, because was broken when it got to me.....I guest it was to cheap .
I loved dirty laundry... I read it in hours, I couldn't stop til I was finish.... Can't for part 2 to come out .
I was very hesitant on starting this book since it was based of an marriage relationship gone wrong, since I am more of a mystery thrillers fan. But this book surprised me page after page. Gillian flynn's writing has an absolute new take on how a individual could think about their life partner, so much as that makes you feel a chill running down your spine. In the middle before i reached part two of the book, I didn't know if I should empathize or sympathize with the narrator. Since both the characters take turns on every chapter to have their very own personal view on marriage (which I loved), Gillian knew how to play with her words and form her own visions of dramatization.Since everyone had given their own personal synopsis on the story I wouldn't dwell on it much.It is a dark thriller which makes us question who do we really know in our lives?Can any of us be the true self and not a facade of personalities we try to pretend?Go for it if you like any sort of Dark mysteries .
I must confess every time Lothaire was mentioned in previous books i would wait desperately to see what becomes of him, for some reason always had a feeling he was much more than his brooding arrogant persona. And boy was I satisfied, could't have asked for a better story. This had much more depth than I had anticipated. KC has done a great job with this badass vampire king who had no feeling of what so ever until he met his bride. I can't wait for the Nix to find her calling. The friendship between Nix and lothaire was always so touching and tender, loved their confrontation. So far my second favorite book after Demon from the dark. Go for this book if you want a resistant bride unwilling to be a bound by the most evil and powerful vampire in the Lore .
Loved this book to the core. Maclaine is amazing  as a true demon/vampire and carrow's characterization is beyond expectation.The little Ruby has added to this book the much needed family love and tenderness. I couldn't put down this book. The ending was truly magnificent it had the punch in the right direction. All the powerful Lore characters from all the books coming under one roof to take down the Order, simply brilliant. Loved every aspect of Maclaine, and Carrow's ferocity. My favorite by far.Great job KC .
I was pleasantly astonished to find myself wanting to finish this book and also read the series. They do have the predictable story line but who doesn't want to end a book with a happily ever after.It has all the plus points of giving the reader exactly what they want to hear and feel.Making it worth a read. Melody Anne has definitely the kept me intrigued and wanting to finish the series .
The mat is OK, but is just a flimsy piece of paper, not real mat board, and certainly not worth the $10 plus $5 S&H I paid for it, but for some reason no stores in my area were carrying these types of mats at grad time, so I was stuck buying one on line .
Kept me ok on my toes the whole time. Sex scene not as hot ad I would have wanted the knob though. But the store was still full of spice .
I love it! I have lost 14 pounds in 2 months with taking these and watching what I eat. I don't have my cheat days but I still see the weight coming off.It gives me energy. I haven't had any cravings. I can see my stomach shrinking .
I found the book to be extremely entertaining.  There wasn't a moment that I found myself bored and wondering when we would get to the action.  I liked the heroine and the two love interests of hers are both very likable .
The product was better then I was expecting to receive, being a halloween costume. The tiara and skirt light up beautifully, the skirt wasn't shorter then shown. I also received the product on time and in perfect condition. I am very pleased with my purchase .
This Muffin pan is Very good. It arrived in time and all the muffins come out nicely. they did not stick at all .
i gave it 4 start because series is still very good but starting to get confusing. Also don't really like olivia with the dark hair looks like a wig .
Me and my 2 year old LOVE this book and mitts, I bought 2 one for us and I gave one to a friend for her baby shower! because every parent needs this (: this book creates the most beautiful sound throughout our home... laughter! uncontrollable deep belly laughter that takes his breath away! we read this book everyday sometimes more then once! he will bring it to me and ask me to be the tickle monster! and no matter what I am doing I stop and put on the gloves! (: probably our favorite book .
they do not stick to textured walls. they fell off our walls within hr or so of putting them up .
these do not work at all! the kids at my sons party were pretty bummed they couldn't make the whistles work .
they are good and nice and convenient but they don't seal well enough the paint will thicken and start to dry out after a while .
its alright, the tray to hold paint is to small for those nice no spill paint cups... and its very hard to find the paper roll size unless u get a very skinny one or buy directly for there website .
they fit well my son loved them and they did not rub any blisters on him! will buy more when summer come around again and he needs a bigger size .
I don't know if it is supposed to leak all over the place but i kinda of doubt it. writing with it is smooth but not only does ink come out at the point of the pen (the nib) but it comes out on the top of the silver part and then where the nib and black thing connects it leaks there to so when i try to write with it, it gets ink all over my fingers....and hopefully you write semi fast because the longer you hold the nib on the paper ink just pours out. it took me a while to write the review because i thought maybe that i was putting the ink in wrong or squeezing it to hard or something but i've even just put the ink in without squeezing it and the outcome is the same no matter what .
a little cheep and have had to put the binoculars back together a few times, flashlight isn't great but we just use it for pretending games, shadow puppets, and reading books in the dark so it works for us.. everything is basically ok, not good or great just kinda it will do.. it is def more for pretending and playing not so much for actual use of them .
they are wonderful my son was so excited! he LOVES Thomas. but they are pretty cheaply made. already coming apart at the seam when we opened them.. and the material seems like it will rip easy.. but they get my little one excited and ready for bed time so that's a big plus, but probably won't last very long. (however we have lots of Thomas clothes ((winter hats, gloves, and blankets)) and they all seem like they are cheaply made and come apart at the seems within days..) so I wasn't expecting much better quality, just sew it back myself and it stays together.. so that's why I still give it 4 starts cause I purchased only because Thomas was on them. they look better in person then in the picture and the blue one is nice and fuzzy and warm, the green one is thin so better for warmer nights .
fun! not much control of the car just go or stop.. but still tones of fun but the battery only last 8min so that is inconvenient cause u have to stop every 8min and recharge it .
This case does not fit the Droid.  I have to remove the case every time I want to charge my phone because the holes do not line up.  This was a total waste of money .
These earrings are great!  The price was good and they came rather quickly.  Also, they have a notch that helps secure the earring onto your ear so they don't fall out of your ears .
These fit my iPhone 5 S perfectly.  The price is great and I couldn't be more pleased!  I recommend this product .
This case looks exactly like it does online.  It's pretty and fits perfectly.  The only downside is that the case doesn't cover the screen .
These are not the real thing..sound is terrible compared to the real galaxy earbuds.. definitely get what you pay for!! In addition to the 3 weeks it takes to ship from china .
I found way bigger and cheaper dog pillows at Walmart!!!! &#128545; not happy with my purchase at all! Half price of what I payed .
I am 59 and primary cook "certified foodie" in the family. My wife has asked me to prepare special diets to keep weight down for both of us at times. My experience has been that while we have kept weight off with South Beach, long term shopping requirements were too intense and unsustainable. The meals were also not satisfying for the level of cooking I enjoy. We would go on South Beach and lose weight, go back to normal schedule and put weight back on and repeat process. The cauliflower "fake mashed potatoes" grew pretty weary as a Julia old school French cooking fan. Forget the no wine phase. Great glass of wine after a long day is well deserved. There are several pretty good meals on Doctor Oz such as the tofu tacos and shredded chicken BBQ that really surprised me and are normal weekday new additions worth a Google.About six months ago I started many of the recommendations mentioned in the book before even reading it. I get to keep my passion for trying new dishes with best fresh ingredients but just limited portions. In the past I would eat whatever portion the host or host put on the plate so as not to offend. Now I always tell the host or hostess I am on portion control but want to sample every thing they have prepared.Bottom line, I would rather have a small serving of great food than my previous life where the pounds would add up with no portion control. Add a reasonable level of exercise and I have dropped weight from 180 to 160 in six months and still look forward to dinner!A nice add on to this book might be the best dishes author has tasted in his travels. If I am going to have less, I want the best .
They should list what size bottles it does fit.  Buyer beware.  Cheap plastic, tube does not go all the way down to the bottom of the bottle either .
Not as fun and exciting as the first ones, the last two were more mundane.As much as I was looking forward to reading this book, I will think twice about getting another Stephanie Plum novel .
Sweater runs smaller than sizing chart advises. I am a size 14/16 and i would have bought an XL based on the sizing chart. However, they were out of that size, so I ordered a 2XL, thinking it would be kind of nice to have a roomier fit, since I planned to wear this over leggings. Not so much. The 2XL is VERY tight, although that sizing is suppose to fit an 18/20 .
shipping took a bit longer than expected though i bought a used one. I have never owned a Dyson or a similar in price vacuum, the reviews i read stated that this one has stronger suction. My parents bought a vacuum that needed a small loan to buy and I can tell this one is better. More importantly I don't feel like I'm going into battle carrying around all the attachments with this. Even the hose has a better and more controlled suction .
I'm convinced that I received a knockoff. This is my 4th time purchasing an OtterBox product and I have never had this problem before. my last OtterBox lasted almost 2 years and during that time only one of the clasps broke. But with this case only two of the inside clasps are left and it's only been 3 weeks of usage, every time I'd go to unclasp it one of the clasps would break. I would never order from this particular seller again due to the fact .
I could not stop watching it...... I didn't want to miss a second.. I literally was on the edge of my seat .
This item did not work. I tryed so many thing but they just wouldn't work. I would not recommend this item .
I wear these under my cargo mtb shorts and they are so comfortable. Long 30 mile rides in the woods are great with these things on. Makes the saddle seem like a big cushion without significant bulk. Awesome construction and price...Buy it .
These things are pretty good if you need a replacement cap. They do the job. Not sure how durable they are, but it's pretty hard to break lens caps anyways .
This case is way more than I expected. I love it. It's made with quality. It's my first Ibera product and definitely not my last. The case is perfect. It doesn't shake, it is sealed, you can use the touch screen with ease, and it is strong. The case looks rad too. Buy it! You won't be disappointed .
I love this stuff! i can't find it at any store so i have to order it online. im in the military so i have to have my hair in a tight (no fly-aways) bun Monday through Friday. Its a great hold and you can brush it out easily with a flake free mess. There is no damage to my hair and it seems to be growing faster than usual .
WAY TOO BIG! unless you want to pay more to get links removed from this watch, don't buy it. Yes, it is cute, and fairly cheap, but i am NOT going to pay more money to get it fixed .
I'm not too pleased because this item comes with clips to keep wires in place they were easily detached and lost and can't find replacements in white .
I really am enjoying this item it is so much better than I expected it makes my Nook expirience so much more pleasureable there is an opening for the speakers an elastic band to secure closure when not in use not to mention the stand to hold in an upright position I love it .
First off, I am a 20 year old male. This product is simply amazing. I have had it about a week, and used it every day so far. I bought this item in hope to clear up my acne/acne scars. I had little hope when purchasing this item due to the fact that I have tried so many different things to clear up my face. Nothing, and I mean NOTHING comes close to this. Like I said, I use it once a day mixing with water, and leave it on roughly 15 minutes. Your face feels so refreshed after you are done. I noticed results in just a couple days of use. Ladies, and gentlemen there is obviously no &#34;miracle&#34; product out there that will just clear up your acne instantly, but this is about as close as it comes. Well worth the money, and honestly I think it's a steal. I would of payed far more money if I knew how well this product worked. I even let my sister, and mom try it, and they too liked it a lot. So before you go waste your money on stuff like nuetrogena, or clearasil; try this Aztec stuff out. Trust me, it will give you much better results, won't irritate your skin, and it's also healthy for your skin unlike most other face products. Anyways, I am very pleased .
Unfortunately I have to have someone keep changing the settings for me.  For someone who is computer illiterate i wouldn't suggest it .
I HATED BECCAUSE IT DOESNT WORK it not good so if ya change for me it will be nice of ya thks .
I was introduced to Mokha Origin coffee two months ago, when the company's founder offered me a cup--with neither sugar nor cream. At first, I was hesitant to try this, or any, coffee black. But after that first sip, I understood why he had insisted I take it plain; this coffee was too good to have its perfect balance of rich aroma and delicate notes corrupted by saccharine or dairy additions. Mokha Origin is coffee to be enjoyed, not endured for the sake of caffeine delivery. It is an experience, and one that I look forward to indulging in again and again .
To be honest, I picked up the novel only after hearing about the upcoming movie. So I didn't really have high expectations. But boy was I wrong. The story and the whole idea was great all in itself; but the story-telling, character development and attention to detail were on a refreshingly high level. Give it a try! Watching the movie will never give you the same level of satisfaction as reading the novel. And that's presuming the movie turns out to be decent .
I can't express how happy I am to have found this app to read and re-read the graphic novels I had already bundled up on my laptop. It's a real joy! And it organizes all the books in shelf like GUI. That's a nice touch too .
This is a fun free app (although there is a paid version). It's not awe inspiring, does exactly what it promises. Recommended .
This was the perfect setup to watch two games simultaneously. I had one match running on tv and the other on my fire HDX through this app. Flawless playback, no delay or lags. 5 stars from me .
Its one of the best work of late Hans Zimmer. It was quite evident that he had the artistic independence to not to stick to any particular theme. I haven't liked an entire OST album since Bourne Supremacy. And &#34;Into the Red&#34; is right up there with &#34;Bim Bam Smash&#34 .
It was a brave attempt to take the angry birds franchise to a turn based RPG genre. And since the game doesn't take itself too seriously, it actually works! And a ton of fun to play .
Such a great read :) I heard you were writing another one, I can't wait for it .
this game doesn't make any sense and I thought it was going to be like wipeout or some thing once again this game sucks .
Its charging my phone the way its supposed to and I do not have to move the cord around to make it work .
This simple product should not cost more than 5$.I personally don't use it because the carrying case is good enough for my needs, and it's for sure better designed .
I got this for one reason, I own a car with leather seats in Arizona, bad business. I just wanted this to make my seats not hot and it does just that. My only complaint is sometimes it itches the back of my legs, but ohter than that its good .
I love this it works perfectly and actaully has a good sound quality to it and its super static like past one's I have bought. I gave this 4 stars though because the remote doesn't work but maybe that because I have a ipod, who knows .
These shoes are the best, no joke. Not only are they super cute (i get tons of compliments on them) but they are really comfy! I wear them all the time .
I thought this was going to be a average smaller purse but its not its small, its tiny. It's the size of a 5 year olds play purse .
I thought this book was like new but it's awesome. No marks or pencil on it. Fast shiping. High recommend .
I thought it was an amazing book, the ending kin  of threw me off though. It's still a GREAT read. I really enjoyed. Just glad my mom's not that way .
This app sucks. Do not buy it, it's not worth almost $3. It's constantly freezing. Also you can't return it. This sucks. Don't I repeat don't buy tho  stupid app. Ugh .
Just started game so, really don't have much to say yet but, so far I like it. I think it's a really cute game to play for all ages. :- .
I was only able to play for the first half hour, before they ask you to buy the game. I'm hooked so I'm definitely going to purchase this game. You won't be sorry if you are into these types of game. Definitely a five star .
I got a replacement for a new battery which would not last long for 2 hours. They gave me another one which lasts for 4 hours. It's not worth the cost .
Makes my skin feel great. Perfect for summer as it is not too heavy and keeps my skin super moisturized without any greasiness. I have combination/oily skin so this is no easy feat .
I don't love the chocolate one as much but the peanut butter is so good! Great way to cut calories in a smoothie .
This show is not Bravo's Best. The case really do not do anything interesting and the drama is very contrived. I wish they would focus more on Joey and Amanda's building a business .
I absolutely love my kindle fire HDX. It's quality is amazing, the screen resolution is great. The features are perfect. The only downside is that it doesn't have a huge selection of apps. But other than that it's perfect. The movies look amazing on this, and the speakers sound great. For the price, this is a steal. It's also super fast .
I've been playing this game for  while and absolutely love It. Until the new update. It says to download the new update and it takes me to the app store but doesn't give me an option to update it!! I'm very dissatisfied. I would appreciate it if you would fix this please. I loved this game .
I've been playing this game for about a month now and had no problems and as soon as the new update for Valentine's day comes in it stops working. It loads then pulls it up and goes right back to the loading screen over and over again. This problem really needs to be fixed. It was my favorite game .
I love this game so much, it's so addicting. It's way better than clash of clans. But I've been having a problem with searching guilds. I created a guild and I play on a kindle fire HDX, and my friend plays on an iPhone, but when my friend tries to search my guild it does not show up. It says still searching guild may not exist. That was the whole point in playing this game so that I could play with my friend. Please Fix this. I want to continue to play but this is making it difficult. Maybe it's because amazon doesn't get frequent updates like iPhone and Android do. But I'd really appreciate it if this could be fixed. Ill give it a five star if this gets fixed .
This is by far the best 7" tablet /e reader I have owned or used. It does so much and moves so fast and smooth it is a true pleasure to use. The screen is incredibly clear. The e reader is much easier to see than other tablet/readers. The text to speech function is a real plus.It is so nice when you have to set it down and it reads to you while you do other things around the house. I love that I can cook, do dishes, fold laundry etc, and still enjoy my book! As far as I know this is the only tablet that has this function and in this price range you can absolutely do no better. There are some tablets that are selling for considerably more and do not do as much or work as well as the Kindle fire. Save your money and jump on this tablet. You won't be sorry .
I really enjoyed this book, it kept my attention, I highly recommend both books, can't wait to read more books by Shan .
True love overcomes obstacles ... Personal and professional.  When family should be there for you, they cause pain instead.  Luckily, people close to them become their support network instead.  Can't wait to read the follow up book .
Since this isn't the first book in the series that I've read, I'm really disappointed that I'm reading them out of order!  I'm going to forge ahead and hope the next one and the last can equal the 3rd, which was amazing .
This is the first book I've ever read by Jay Bell.  It won't be my last.His command of language, his ability to write beautiful prose, is inspiring.  I found myself going back and retreading passages.  Committing lines to memory.  Highlighting phrases I want to revisit.If you love good writing or want to be inspired to write, read this book.  The characters are people you'll want to know better.The only regret I have, is that it's done .
The humor throughout is great.  The characters are fun to read about.  Just enough character development to make them interesting.  Wonderful storyline. Can't wait to read the rest in the series .
You might like this.  No character development.  No plot.  Just an orgy among strangers.  Definitely not any romance to sigh over .
Jay and Sam meet in a remote part of Montana but Sam's past takes them on a whirlwind, circuitous trip to Los Angeles... Where it does not live up to its' nickname... The City of Angels!  Nude sketches by a hippie artist, an inept FBI, bouncers and hit men guarantee a wild ride for two men holding onto each other while hoping for love .
Devin was holding out for Michael to turn gay, so accepting love from someone else was difficult.  Especially since his parents had convinced him he didn't deserve it.  Luckily their were others willing to convince him otherwise .
Two friends become lovers... But it's unclear how long they'll be together and whether or not they're just exploring a new kind of love .
Jase does his best to free Mark to love someone else, but even being half a world away, Mark never let's him go.  DADT is gone, and good riddance .
The plot was excellent.  The main characters admirable, loving, sexy hot, kind and true to their passion and love for each other.  All of the minor characters were 'fleshed out' so you knew their motives and they felt like important parts if the story.  An excellent book!  Thank you Kindle .
Angst never looked so sweet!  Throwing Kody in with his innocent comments and reactions ups the sensitivity level!  I'd love to know Cal's background .
It always seems that people take awhile to figure out what they need, whether it is their job, their friends or their special person.  Just don't give up until you find the perfect one for you, whomever they are.  Everyone has their own special 'perfectness!' .
I loved the story but now need to read the prequel and the next book!  I'm like Jude, I want to know more about their future relationship and whether or not Michael will salvage his relationship with his mom .
I'm not sure why!  It started out as a new book with a great plot but the sex scenes were almost word by word the same .
Educators and law enforcement officers have never looked so good.  Criminals never so evil.  Love never so true.  Mercy makes it all beautiful and true .
This is the first book I've read by Cardeno C. But definitely won't be the last.  The plot grabs your interest from the beginning, the characters are flawed but intriguing and lovable.  Since C.C. Has written several books, I'm looking forward to many hours of pleasure ahead .
it was boring, that's all.More words are required, so it was boring because each response was completely independent of the last, and most had nothing to do with what I said .
There are a lot of songs in this book for eleven bucks. I could not be happier with this purchase .
In the description it ses arc grips they are not good for atvs only dirtbikes and twist throttle they are mx grips they had me fooled thinking they are atv grips and I got them and the one side is for a twist throttle and they want me to pay the shipping cost and restocking fee to return them witch is five dollars less the the grips cost very unsatisfied and grips are no good for mud .
Love this, excellent concept and very well written, every parent wannabe must read this book before starting a family....Excellent book .
I am keeping this book as reference to keep up with the stress, frustrations, from every day work, and unexpected situations, I just grab this book whenever I feel down, and read some of my favorites chapter, and my spirit gets charged up .
Excellent product plus fast delivery, no one could beat that? Hope this eye pencil be available always, and the seller made it possible for me to get this eye pencil as fast as I needed it .
Good product, but I didn't like the way it holds the tablet, a little bit insecure about it, but other than one is a good product .
This Book Unwinds Itself Like No Other Book I've Ever Read... It At First Is A Little confusing but Then It Gets A Little Better To Understand.. It Ends Up Being A Really Good Book .
I Got This For My Daughter And Let Me Tell you... The Is No Doubtably Probably The Biggest Fan Ever... She Loves This Disc Along With The Seven Others And Her Ten Different Books .
She Loves Adventure Time So Much she Has To Be The Biggest Fan Ever... This Is Not Me Favoring Her Over Other Fans But Just Using Statistics... She Prints Off Updated Lists Of The Episodes Every Month... Getting To The Point She Loves Adventure Time And Sh Will Be Keeping This With Her Finn Backpack LOL .
Ok well this book has a great hook and really drags u into it so it's really great up until the end which isn't very good. But up until the end the book shows what true "equality" and "conformity" is .
When it got to my door I wasn't completely sure but yep, it most defiantly was a piece of metal .
The installation had an error and it will not run even to uninstall. Total loss of productivity and money. Autodesk's &#34;customer service&#34; is non-existant. Issues are handled via canned FAQs on website, e-mail chat groups which are impotent, or they want hundreds of dollar to talk to someone. I would recommend buying from a Chinese pirate before dealing with Autodesk .
Arrived on time and perfectly matched my wife breast pump. I was afraid it wasn't going to feet but it did. Includes 2 diaphragms each with two stems .
The product description says HP genuine displayport to vga adapter but the the adapter I received says Foxconn on the back and is made on China. It does not look like the product advertised in the picture. And the worst thing: does not work with my HP Envy X2 laptop. The conector is to big or wide to fit on the displayport socket. Sold by Compeve. I want to return this .
The product is neat and small. But it does not work with my HP Envy X2 screen because it doesn't have enough sensitivity. Besides that is a good product. The little jack plug works well .
I liked very much the presentation of this product. The protective film is not easy to install but the instructive video on youtube is very handy. When just aplyed it gives a kind of microgranular texture to the display but this dissapears in the next days. I do have, however, one negative oppinion. Since I ordered the full body protective skin, there are several films to aply but not enough instalation solution. Just one small cilinder spray is included. My advise: when buying the full skin please include at least 2 or 3 cilinders of installation solution .
I am very please with the usability y size of the keys. No problem at all what so ever. And works perfect with Midnight GBox MX2 box .
Unfortunately it does not fully protect the phone should it drop. It is flush with the phone instead of being higher all around .
The upper part of the shoe was too loose so that my foot was slipping and sliding as I walked. Not a good fit at all .
Thanks for the book and the awesome prize. I enjoying  reading. I recommend to buy e-books you didn't need Kindle to read a book at home. Thanks Amazon&#128521 .
This was a great purchase... I bought these for a trip to the bahamas and I can't wait to go with this luggage .
I don't have negative stuff to say bout this cause i like it :) i ordered it together with the in sax mini8 .
I'm a first timer here at amazon and i took the chance to order this camera cause i've ben wanting this and finally i have something to call my own.. im super in love with it.. well not just me but my boyfriend and the family :) i actually got super excited when i got them with the film.. I know film is kinda pricey but its worth it! I just use mines for special occasion or to take a picture for the kids, even them they liked.. i don't see any problem with it so far .
The plastic screen had a long scratch across the front. The rubber around the case is very flimsy but you get what you pay for. I probably would not buy this type of unit again. I did not return it because returning would cost more than the case .
I had never heard of the Piano Guys until I saw them perform on Katie Couric's show.  I went on the computer and heard more of their music. Then I was sold!The CD puts everything  in one spot.  They are quite talented .
I have enjoyed quite a broad range of vampire movies.  Some good, most bad.  This movie was not bad.  It was far from good though.  Some of the scenes were good and pulled you in.  However, Bill Paxton's character was putrid at best.  If your bored and alone, watch it.  If your with others, I would skip over this title .
I will start by saying that I have never replaced a garbage disposal before.  I was very unsure of what I was getting myself into.  I just knew that the 1/2hp Badger that was installed now had to go.  It was a 3 bolt style and I was looking at getting this and an adapter.  After reading some reviews, somebody had stated that everything that you need to install the Waste King L-2600 was in the box.  So I ordered the Waste King and some plumbers putty for good measure.  It arrived in 2 days in perfect condition.  I opened the box and looked at the contents.  I was instantly over whelmed.  I read the manual and realized that this was much easier than it looked.  I turned off the breaker for the disposal and started to remove it.  I disconnected the wiring from it and removed the pipe then turned it.  It came right out.  I removed an inner flange then pushed, the 3 bolt bracket was out.  I Cleaned up the sink, connected the E-Z connect flange for the Waste King, lifted the Waste King up and spun, it was in!!  I connected the drain pipe (had to cut an inch off it) easily.  Then I noticed the Waste King has a plug in power cord where as the old Badger was wired directly.  I went to Home Depot and got an easy connect plug for the wire and I was done.  I run the water and had no leaks.  Turned on the power and was amazed at how quite it was.  The one thing to note is the rubber guard that stops stuff from falling into the disposal on accident, also stops food.  This takes a bit of getting use to.Pros: Very easy to install and has everything you need.  Quiet and strong.Cons: Was not prepared for the plug in wire. (I know that is not really a con but I had nothing else bad to say .
I bought this and the disk was bad.  Had to get a refund and ended up getting the game via download.  I like it.  It is not GREAT but it is good.  Esp with the price drop .
Very short skirt!!  Use a Pettiskirt extension to help with the length.  It is polyester so it is not great quality but it is a very nice costume.  Make sure you get the matching wig .
The seller is in China, so it took 3 weeks to get to me.  They had it packaged in extreme bubble-wrap.  There was no way the screen was going to get damaged in shipping.  The price was a little more than I had hoped for but it was much cheaper than purchasing a new ipod.  Changing the screen was quite easy.  Took me less than 3 minutes to do.  There are youtube videos that should exactly how to do it .
I installed this very easily.  It is quiet and just works.  When I am playing a game or converting a family DVD, the cooler keeps my processor nice and cool.  Well worth the money.  The hardest part nobody mentions, is the routing of the thick hoses.  I am glad I made this purchase and would do it again .
I put off buying this for years.  I broke down and I have not regretted the decision. Installation was a little tricky with my full faced helmet due to a sun visor operator on the left side of my helmet.  I put this on the right which works out fine because I can do everything via voice commands.  They say there is a way to bang the units together to get them to connect to each other.  I have only gotten this to work once.  The web site stuff is pretty useless except for programming the headset.  This allows you to assign names (which it announces) and groups.  I do not think I will ever be able to ride without this again.  I absolutely love it and would buy it again .
Once again, Skrillex comes out of the studio like a boss.  A mix of dub step and reggae that should never be played with the volume turned down .
I did some searching as far as benchmarks.  This was one of the highest ranked AMD processors.  There were some higher ranged Intel ones so I looking into them first.  The prices were way more than what I was willing to spend.  I ordered this along with a Thermaltake Water 2.0 PRO/All In One Liquid Cooling System CLW0216.  Placed it on a AM3+ board, fired it up and nothing... Windows 7 would not boot.  I installed a new copy of Windows 7 and it worked perfectly.  I used Handbreak to compare my before and after.  My previous system, a 2500MHz AM2+ system, would do about 132 fps.  Now I get 315 fps.  For the effort/price, this was a great purchase .
I have a Nexus 5. I can lay it on here at almost any angle and it starts to charge.  The only thing I do not like is the blue LED that blinks to tell you it is charging is bright and very easy to see.  Kind of gets annoying at night, on the dresser, next to the bed, when you are trying to sleep.  A piece of black tape with a pin whole fixed it .
The case is thin and does not add too much bulk to the phone.  It does not cover the top nor the bottom of the phone.  There is no cover for the glass either.  It does provide a very nice holster.  When the phone is not in the holster, the holster is hardly noticeable. It does offer a kickstand that is not even apparent unless you are looking for it.  I have not used this feature but the design of it is very impressive .
I just bought this last week for use in my son's graduation for use on my X-T1.  I was able to sit about 5 ft from people and get a clear zoom on their faces without any shake.  For shots about 50 yards away, I was able to get full body shots.  The colors came out very clear.  The lens is heavy but after getting use to it, it was not an issue .
I have a Nexus 5 and a Bose Sound Dock Series II. I plug it in, attach the USB and the audio plug to the phone, and it works.  Now I can charge my phone while I listen using the Bose.  I was afraid when I replaced my old iPhone that I would no longer be able to use it.  Thanks to the dockBoss5, I can.  The only thing is I have not tested it with my vehicle and will update once I do.  Also, it is kinda a pain to have wires sticking out of the top and bottom of the phone but without replacing the Bose, this is the BEST option .
No matter what I did, I could not get this cover to go on correctly.  Luckily there is 3 in a pack!  That way I could mess up 3 times in a row.  This is a good deal, even though I failed .
It use this for my X-T1 and two lenses, cleaning kit, batteries, charger, and still have room for any miscellaneous items that get handed to me while we are out.  It is a little on the big side for me but I like it.  The material is canvas and feels very well made.  The straps on the front are buttons.  The strap is nice and wide so it does not dig into your shoulder.  I am very happy with this bag .
Thin, easy to hold, nice texture.  I still cannot believe there is a built in stand.  I use a stand very seldom but when I do, I no longer need to look around for it .
This magical mirro is very cool, and my baby girl loves it very much. I can't find it in Taiwan .
Simply written by persons with great practical experience, there is no direct substitute for those who lack scientific background.  My own family has used this text as a guide on the mission field.  Robert D. Patton, MD, former professor of internal medicine in Liberia, West Africa .
This textbook is several decades old, but remains very pertinent to the cause of missions.  We still use it as our textbook.  There are more recent texts, but they do not match this text in terms of readability and ease of comprehension .
Written in an exciting manner, Richardson takes you into the life of the Sawi and their thinking processes.  He is an exceptional writer.  Although I could not claim that redemptive analogies (God making a clear illustration of salvation within the culture) is true in EVERY society, while in Suriname for 26 years among the Bush Negro people, I did find one as well .
This is a helpful book which shows the contrast between the Isa the messiah of Islam and Jesus of Nazareth.  You may be surprised to see the similarities initially, but as the book progresses, you will see that they are two very different people who cannot be reconciled.  One is a man who never died and was not God the Son.  The other is God the Son, who died on the cross for our sins.  These are helpful concepts .
This book, now a classic, gives God great glory for His work in Bruce Olson's life.  As a missionary, I certainly would not recommend many of the things that Bruce did in the beginning, bur his appreciation of the culture and the people has been wonderful and the Lord has worked greatly in the lives of the people.  Read with discernment and see God at work.Robert Patton, MDMissionary to Suriname .
This book focuses primarily on the logical assumptions of evolution rather than on the data.  As the author points out, often both evolutionists and creationists agree on the facts but not on the interpretation because of difference of worldviews.  This book is helpful in understanding basic issues confronting the evolutionist/creationist controversy.Robert Patton, MD .
This book is extremely helpful in understanding in a compassionate way the Insider Movement, and yet revealing the fundamental flaws in the movement.  I appreciated the overall tone of the book, which is not blasting the attitude of the insider movement, but demonstrating that the movement is attractive but unbiblical and fails to lead to strong Christians among Muslims.  There is a basic fallacy in theology in the Insider Movement that is clearly demonstrated.  This spills over into translations which have been creating major problems in a number of Muslim countries .
The acting was OK, and the filming.  However, I was very disappointed that they alter a number of Biblical stories in details.  I had hoped to use this in one of my missions classes at the college level, but the alterations prevent that.  Sadly, by altering several items, they lose the true impact the Bible gives.  Man seems always to be trying to better the Bible, and it cannot be done .
I have read about 30 books on the Biblical translation issues, but the author approaches the issue as a professor of English rather than from theology or textual issues.  While I disagree with the author on his preference for the critical text (which he never discusses, but obviously prefers the English Standard Version), I appreciated his critique of the modern translations as inferior from the point of view of English literature .
The big difference in this book is the emphasis not only on loving the wife, but on respecting the husband.  Both are to be unconditional.  A mission agency pretty much requires their missionaries to read this book prior to going overseas.  After reading it, I concur .
This compact hub is neat and functions well.  I have been pleased with its performance.  It is immediately sensed; no problems with its use.Robert Patton .
I have been pleased thus far with this small unit.  I make broadcasts and podcasts, and am not involved in complicated setups, but this unit uses little space, gives an adequate boost to my microphone, and has virtually no humming or buzzing.  It is well worth the cost.Robert Patton .
This book is a classic on persecution and suffering.  Foxe wrote it at the time of suffering and not 300 plus years later.  The same sort of suffering is being experienced by many Christians today .
Reasonable price, comfortable, big enough to carry bills and passport, no problems with setting off alarms from metal.  You need to be aware that it will be picked up on a body scan, and I have had to remove it on airline trips .
This is very well done as a missionary story.  If you are a missionary as I am, you will enjoy it.  I particularly enjoyed seeing the family in action - reminded me of my daughter and son-in-law in Suriname, South America, where they have a ministry involving their nine children.  It is not a drama, however, if that is what you want .
I get one of these for my Dad each year. He is a trout fisherman but nothing like some eye candy in waders to make him think of taking me along with him to the mountains and do some fishing.This calendar has some really good photos of girls posing with fish. Nothing risque, just HOT .
Trying it on face but still has perfume added to it so it's a no go for me. It didn't do anything but make face sticky .
I'm not a fan of T-fal but this pizza nonstick pan works good, it lets air through and cooks pizzas from small to large well without putting them on a rack or stone. I prefer this over a stone .
I would suggest another brand. First thing is the plastic itself is not clear to begin with, poor design or Quality control.Used multiple times but still got either bubbles or not very good contact between the two pieces .
It's great for really cleaning your hair squeaky clean but has a strong odor smell that affects my allergies. I don't understand why nature or natural claiming anything would put dyes or perfumes in their products .
Best safety and sunglasses you do not have to worry about! Large 130mm  and slight silver reflective coating. The clarity is very good with these .
Got for my mother, at first it was fitting loose but after wearing it in she likes them, No wires and comfort strap works. Great price from Amazon for these as well. She says getting harder to find good bras in local stores anymore .
It's ok i guess, when spraying out it sometimes never comes out of can evenly. Also it is kinda strong smell at first, so might want to check your allergy to it first in a small test area. It does mask odors or etc for animals or just heavy traffic areas and will die down on odor strength after a few hours or a day. After  three days though its not even noticable but no odor .
Accurate little thermometer, have not tried it out in the freezer yet but no doubt it will work there as well .
Has little jaws that come in and grab jar lid once tightened down, then the leverage of the handle gives you grip to take lids off. Not sure how this will help elderly as they need both a stationary base and something to take top off but this works good .
Does what it says, good on the hair not too harsh and not too harsh of a smell also which is a plus to me who has allergies .
Nice big metal birdhouse. Good construction. Has three sections so you can fill up to three different types of feed. Big enough to where other birds don't scare off smaller birds if one or another is on an opposing side. lol I hung this using a metal rod style pole that grips to deck or porch, if this feeder filled makes the rod droop you can always put in vice and bend it to the right height you need it to stay. This feeder also is great and comes with post option mounting. Only thing is i wish the top was a little bigger than bottom as to better keep rain off or make more shade .
This works well if you cut the onion in half or quarters but will not work well with a whole veggie etc. It's plastic so i see this in the future breaking at some point when pushing down with force, but for now it works as advertised. Has two removable sized grids which I used by itself once on a potato.  Dishwasher safe! and comes with cleaning tool for top underside .
I'm not a fan of the command stickless stuff as in the past i've had things fall off of variety of walls. This one works well in the bathroom, i use it as a towel holder to the shower tub surface and it holds very good .
This light is way brighter than the old maglight 3 cell. Pop in some duracells and this baby will stay good in your vehicle for a long time. I would not waste time in finding a led bulb to place in old mag, i would buy this with the real led made for it .
Very good story from the Roots on into Queen. I'm not really a fan of Halle Berry but she was great in this movie. Lots of good actors played in this movie. Highly recommend it .
Have yet to find too many things that the Japanese don't make well. This thing does good at grinding coffee. Glass bottome and well built simple grinder .
Tried this for psoriasis and will work sometimes but did not for me even when taking the pills. This is not to be confused with oregano you cook with! this stuff is already mixed with olive oil but is not too potent .
Got for my nephew who likes transformers, he liked the somewhat confusing opening and manipulation of getting each picture to show. So far they haven't torn but are made of heavy paper design, same as we had as a kid type stuff. overall price was good .
This is a good bath brush. Soft bristles and once piece wood design with lanyard. Just a sort of soft to medium scrubbing feel from bristles and once piece wood so not to fall apart or decay as fast .
Dial white tea smells sooooo goood! and the foaming action makes it great for kids or adults to want to use when washing hands. Doesn't dry out hands or effect the skin .
Pretty good peanuts, not too salty and not too oily. Overall a somewhat hard crunchy peanut that has a unique flavor and roast to it .
It's a good halogen bulb that gives a bright white appearance almost matching HID. I've used these for years over the yellowish phillips bulbs that come default. These fit the fogs on a 2012 hyundai sonata with no issues .
Used on Glock and is ok but not padded inside and is kinda tough to get pistol in and out of even with laser light accessory on bottom. Good once you get used to it i guess but still for quick draws i prefer Mikes nylon or leather type .
Very good tire and rim cleaner. It cleans tires and rims with hardly any scrubbing, none if reasonably light dust. For years i used a dollar store cleaner made by quick stuff inc but that was discontinued as company went OOB. This is good if you can get Eagle One AtoZ at a good price, this is the only cleaner by eagle one I like or would use. Have used it on chrome and aluminum rims with no issues of acidity or tire markings .
Got it for my dad who like me has no padding in the back to keep up our pants, it works really well for him. 2 inch wide with sturdy gripping teeth on ends and adjusters with carhartt written on it. I think it will last a while .
I use this with my PC for TV using Charter provided cable box &#34;Motorola digital&#34; box not HD. Using blaster on front of cable box IR i can use my windows media player remote only. There is some lag from box but that is normal even with the charter remote to the box. lol  Works great! Windows 7 with Hauppauge tuner .
It did not bother my allergies at all! It works like a strong gel hold, but the only thing i found fault was i have dark hair and at the end of the day it dried into flakes if touched and made my hair look like dandruff. It holds as a gel but needs R&D on flaking apart .
It works ok, sometimes the spooling mechanism gets hung up and cord does not want to wind itself. But for the price you get what you pay for, overall a short good retractable cable for using any phone to aux usage .
It's good because it has oatmeal in it, and it has no smell which is plus! It does however leave my skin with a greasy sticky feeling that i don't care for, but it does help with my dry skin after showers and for general stuff. I do know oatmeal is a good natural moisturizer so it works. As far as Eczema, I would not know if it helps or not .
Worked very good this past summer at keeping mosquitoes off of us here in the South. Was new to Picaridin but seems more safer than DEET. Smells not too bad and had that skin so soft softly feeling .
Got for my elderly mom and she prefers wide version but over all the walking of shoe was nice she said and the sole was not slippery or wore uneven so far .
It's ok up to about 180lbs, after that it becomes stiff against your end. For a heavy guy id look into memory foams or cushions with filler because this did not cut it for me. I'm using this until i can find another that works for me .
Helps my mother get up and off toilet and she is on the heavy side. It is somewhat flimsy in some ways as the front doesn't mount down but it allows for moving up to clean! overall i found it good. I did however have to modify the seat as the plastic tabs on back stuck out further than probably most would .
Used it to fill a tahoe and a small car, both works well and the pump doesn't even drag at all. Nicely built pump compressor, recommend this over the cheaper plastic ones .
Haven't had time to fully try this out long enough but so far it doesn't bother my allergies and seems good for now. Will try to update this again later at its Anti Fungal properties .
Never was a fan of lana until the great gaxby soundtrack with beautiful, after that found this track and has a good beat and sound to it also .
First: MADE IN THE U.S.A!!!!  Finally something NOT made in CHINA!This can opener does not fail at opening steel cans or other cans. I use this when the automatics choke up and cannot open cans. The big handle makes it easier to get a grip and rotate .
Its ok, could have a little louder ring as my hard hearing mother could not quite hear the ring well. Although the clarity of the phone is really good. I love how when someone calls it tells you who is calling. overall worth the price from Amazon .
Works good for me, no irritation and smells good for two days even without a shower. Overall the dry solid is best choice as the clear gels are messy and seem to not last as good. Appears to have the same amount of metal as others in it but this brand works best out of using right guard, mens dove, axe, mitchum, or old spice .
It's recycled so that is great, the pens last a long time and really good to write with. Not sure if ink is recycled but its an overall good pen .
I've used Sandisk for years, never seems to fail me. I got this brand because it was one of the cheaper prices ones for a 32gb at the time. Overall have had no problems with it. Reasonable transfer speeds .
Keyboard works good for the price on Amazon. Three led light choices to choose from Blue, Red, and Purplish i think color. Large print is good for those who can't see characters well. Light function can be manually turned off above keypad by holding in the led light button .
Great size for making fondue etc. I used for melting chocolate for dipping peanut butter balls and found setting on low side about 3 to 4 dots up worked best. Use oil in bottom when melting chocolate morsels so not to scorch or etc. Stainless cleans up very good, i was sad to see it was not dishwasher safe and recommended hand washing but that was no big deal. Came with the 4 dipping spears with different colors on the end .
Very beautifully done piece of glass and detail is superb. When i got mine it was broken at the stem &#34;most likely caused by UPS slamming boxes around&#34; but i was able to glue it back. It was shipped very securely wrapped but not delivery driver proof .
Good little hit, did not know this was a religious type song. Has that good bad to the bone style beat .
It fits like a hard case on back and keeps it tight, the back is that gel rubber which i don't care for as it tends to be slippery especially with oily hands like me and leaves streaks. The sides are a rubberish grip but more hard like a plastic than real rubber. It's ok but the perfect one would be this with real rubber gripping bumper sides with a back the same .
Good god paul anderson, i am a long fan of resident evil and your lovely wife Milla but this film kinda sucked. It did take alot from the game some but some of the action scenes were cheesy, and i could tell some makeup on zombies was poor. The story line seems all messed up as well and was confusing from the start, milla falls in water wakes up in umbrella.....fights and kills the main guy from last movie but yet at ends fights on his side and now given the t-virus again?? I can see that this is leading up to going back to the hive to fight the &#34;changed appearance&#34; the &#34;red queen&#34;. Why could you not leave some things as they are. kudos on milla still pulling off her hotness but in the last film please paul get help .
Fits my note 2 good and does not slide off too easily and snugs it just right. Sometimes lint may stick to it &#34;but that is because it is rubber like&#34;. overall with the skin on it i can dock it in my desktop dock that has pen holder style with no issues. Also gives good gripping surface while using brodit. Overall a good cheap purchase that beats the crap out of a folder or hard plastic type case .
Can buy these at dollar store cheaper, came dryed out on some of the cherries so not sure if old or just shipping etc and temperature. Stick with original flavors as these taste just like them .
Not a real fan of Rihanna, but she does have a few hits or songs i like. This song with Mikky Ekko is really nice and has a good beat or rhythm to it. She sings very well on this .
Is ok and has good smell to it. Keeps skin somewhat hydrated, not sure yet on the sea minerals in it and its effects but will keep using and see how it goes. I like Dove for bodywash that or irish spring and dial gold .
It goes on easy enough and holds up easy enough, but the drawback i found was it holds grease and finger prints easily and does not wipe clean easily. Causes rainbow effect once dirty or greasy also .
Have had this for months in use even through the past cold winter misery we had in the south and still works. Takes good pictures and battery life is longer than that of some other brands. I wrote to moultrie because of worry of cold temps and operation range and the info they gave me said it would work and it did, the rayovac batteries i had in it didn't die as well! overall for low budget this worked good .
Was free, has good beats and good tone. Likable some not sure on the group as a whole yet. will see later .
Doesn't bother my allergies and smells good. Cleans hair fairly well and holds up all day, although you can tell its natural and not chemically fortified so you get what you get with natural shampoos .
I love CONTIGO products, over the years i've owned three. One stainless for coffee, one water bottle, and now this one. I like the locking mechanism on this and never leaks. The double wall is nice but will still sweat on hot days with a cold drink. I wish they had put insulation or styrofoam substance in between. Contigo makes good stuff .
It's a nice little stuffed bear but the picture looks slightly darker brown that what actually the bear is. Also the frame is not wood but vinyl. I noticed some loose bear hair at first picking it up and running my hands through. Overall still a good gift for the price .
This cable works very nicely and transfers with no issues, the long length is good for making runs or just to use at home .
This might be good for stadium but too large for a chair use, when mine arrived it had a terrible odor coming from it like plastics or spoiled water although checking it did not show signs of previous ownage or damages. I think it comes that way from factory. The memory foam in it &#34;if any&#34; is less than 1/8th of an inch the rest is stiff foam .
Wonderful to hang on the wall for those who can't see well and enough space to write reminders on the dates .
The wipes themselves are tough enough to do the job but don't tug too hard out of the container or else they will tear apart &#34;what makes them flushable indeed&#34;. The container is really nice but is kind of awkward in that the wipes come from the side instead of the top. The lid that comes down has a rubber ring to keep moisture in &#34;it promotes&#34; but yet the lid doesn't snap very well down. As far as on your bum, the paper is soft and ample size. I can see this paper type being way more flushable than some others out there .
This stuff says limited edition but has been on the market for at least a year or more, which is great to me! This stuff smells good and doesn't seem to affect my allergies too bad. As with most oils that plug in i say it lasts for a month or two .
This slot machine is really nice for the price. You manually pull lever and it spins, if you land on the right sequence money tokens will fall out! You can put real money in it if you want. It has a feature that when you put in the the money you can't access it unless you either win or hit the secret release. Overall a nice little gift for the person who never leaves vegas. lol .
It's ok i guess it seems to work more than Kaspersky at controlling your pc and life. I don't like how long it takes customer service to get back with you and some features on it doesn't make sense and other parts are lacking. More intrusive than kaspersky but again i think the Romanian side is more advanced than the russian side of AV .
Easy to connect and setup, it works well for a electronic doorbell. The range we have it is about 4 feet so long distances i'm not sure about. Has many tunes to choose from which would come in handy on holidays etc. For the price it's not too bad .
Its okay for budget scratchers but these are plain bamboo ones with a somewhat fast finish on it. They are not that thick also. but you pay for what you get .
It's ok if you weigh about 70lbs else you will flatten it out in one sit. Not firm and not for heavy people .
Why call this dermatologist or allergenic at all if it has perfume added. This stuff is nothing more than after shave for men! It doesn't even moisturize well, and the &#34;energy&#34; part i wonder about .
Nothing brings back memories of watching little house on the prairie and highway to heaven series. Like the waltons and other great tv series that taught good lessons in life &#34;sadly replaced by trash on tv today&#34 .
The quality of this ring is great for the price. Other jewelers ask $250 for almost the same thing and they claim it's on sale. My fiance works with cars and doesn't like anything too flashy, so this ring is absolutely perfect. It also arrived perfectly on time. Overall, great service .
This amp shipped quickly and it sounds better than any amp I've previously owned. It doesn't get hot when it's running either. I am completely satisfied with my new amp .
Will not charge with this case on it keeps plug from connecting good I like the case nice looking thanks .
These pens work very well.  They are a different way to enhance scrapbook pages.  Can't wait to try them on cards .
This cartridge is really cool.  The graphic designs can be adapted to many applications. I can't wait to go scrapbooking again .
These shoes are light weight and comfortable.  The heel is just right.  My feet don't hurt when I wear these .
THIS HAS BECOME MY GO TO SHOE.  I HAVE TO MAKE MYSELF WEAR OTHER SHOES SO I WON'T WEAR THIS ONE OUT .
It looks identical to the photo. It's a fairly large stone. There are no issues with the prongs and the stone is not loose. Unfortunately I bought the wrong size for my finacee and they don't make it in a 5.5 .
i liked the necklace only flaw is the chain but there isn't really anything we can do about it for the money it costs. Any code geass fan should get one .
it fitted perfectly on my psvita i recommend this product to any psvita owner, it doesn't attracts dust so you won't feel dust while playing, I can't really say anything of the lcd screen  protector because i didn't use it so I don't know what's its quality .
Don't download this app! It doesn't let me create a new account or log into my old account. Kik keeps saying that there's an error. Well I'll tell you what the error is! It's that this app was put on the market, but was never tested! &gt .
I love diamond dash .! &lt;3 But the only problem i have with it is that the app takes pretty much about 5 minutes to load ! And sometimes it won't even load and this app keeps freezing! This is an OUTRAGE ! But still a good app / game ! {-: ^O^&lt;3 .
I downloaded this app yesterday, thinking that it'd be a not so fun game. but it's a great app !  My kids love it and they just can't get enough of guessing all the movies that they've seen .
Great product, shipped on time, can't go wrong with these .
This bracket with an eliminator kit gives u the Clean look, tail end looks amazing, easy install, quality material and design perfect fit, excellent product u won't be disappointed .
Excellent quality, love the features and fits perfectly, no need to cut anything just plug and play,  this is definatly worth the investment cuz it gets rid of those turn signals giving u a much much better look .
Got it as a gift, I ride a Yamaha FTW! But my bud likes it so no complaints, buy it .
How can you not love Kristen hannah?  The story take so many unexpected twists and turns it is hard to guess what is coming up next.  Good read but a bit slow getting into .
This shirt runs very small.  It not only fades slightly on first wash, even in cold water but shrinks slightly as well..I purchased this as a work shirt so ordered an XL to be slightly large. After the first wash it is more like a generously sized medium.  This was a major disappointment .
Too small to use for much of anything.  Perhaps to use for pins when sewing but not for food or dining .
This is crap!  Slip proof is not exactly the truth.  Maybe if ya stand on it your feet won't slip but nothing else is stationary on it.  The cats couldnt keep theit footing.  Price is an add on item so not worth sending it back.  Good yard sale item .
This item is huge.  Discreet is not an option with this item  Decided to send it back and find something that is advertised as small .
I ended up cutting the hood off - just too much material.  Lounger is perfect for when you get out of the shower but not warm enough to lounge in on a cold winter day .
I bought 2 sweaters to give one as a Christmas gift and one to keep.  They really are pretty and the quality is OK.  Unfortunately I ordered XL but received Med.  These fit a size 2 but certainly no anything larger .
It was not for me, but i think that my girlfriend like it, and we didn't have to go walmart .
I like this gloves a lot but the padding its not what i was expecting, much harder than i thought .
This cover is nice but it didn't fit the phone it says its for ( Galaxy S2].  Very disappointment I'm not Anker to show it off .
I CANNOT believe that Amazon would carry such a USELESS piece of 'literature'!  What good does a summary of this book do to inform interested readers?  As far as summaries go, this is by far the WORST I have ever come across.  Amazon should do more for its customers and remove this piece of garbage ASAP.  VERY UNSATISFIED .
Bought this case for my wife and we were thoroughly impressed with it!  I couldn't believe it would be such a solid case for the price.  Definitely worth every penny .
I loved it. Already own and watched part 1 and was looking forward to part 2 and it didn't disappoint me. All great. Delivered in great condition and fast. All that like to laugh id advise looking to this movie .
I have watched this series before and loved it but sadly missed the end so I decided to buy the series to catch up on old memories. It didn't disappoint a bit. It came quite in one pack and was delivered real fast in real good shape. For all that like a kind of mystery show with a entertaining story and a good character play then I would advise you to buy these series. I find it remarkable how Johnny uses his abilitys to help others. Will Johnny though be able to save the future of many people? If you want to know I would buy the series now :D. I know that was mean of me but hes worth it .
This movie has a interesting story, it also came in a great condition, no scratches at all, I really enjoyed to watch this movie. I advice this movie for all in age of 15 .
ok I bought this dvd since it sounded real interesting. A woman raising wolf children. Of first I didn't know what I should think of it since I thought how can a women get wolf children. I was concerned that it would turn out to be a bad animal abusive movie since you hear of so many things of today and people get so many ideas of getting money these days. Well I made a choice to check it out for all of you. In fact after I watched it I had tears in my eyes for the story was not bad at all. It was so much feeling so much love so much well lets say its fantastic. I don't cry easy but this just brought me in different character rolls which I can't explain since I would ruin the movie for all of you. I just can say it was a sweet treat. I always enjoyed watching anime since 20 years and im 26 now and I think if we had more people that would let there children watch anime we would have less crime in our world more then letting them watch the children programs of today. Plus they would learn better things. Don't get me wrong, its great that we have these series but they changed over time, there more over being fun and not of showing our children what love and all the other real important feelings are about these days. But I think you should buy it and check out for yourselfs .
It was a watered down version of what I usually get! Very disappointed after paying $200!!I won't be buying this product again .
this item was too small than my expectations did not like at all. i needed something much much more bigge .
I inhaled this book! The plot was riveting and the ending was as it should be. Well done! I may be biased because I grew up in Spencerport as did the author, and loved the references to it and the surrounding Rochester area. That being said, this is the kind of book that you don't want to end, and immediately think &#34;this would make an awesome movie&#34; as soon as it's finished. Thank you David for writing such a riveting and thoroughly enjoyable book. I will be sharing it with my family .
Thought it was a great read, kept me interested the whole way though it, didn't expect the way it ended .
so easy to be installed, and works really really great.I highly recommend it.I didn't use it for long time but it seems that high quality .
very nice shoe and looks so pretty, I didn't buy it , but it looks nice, lol, funny face , happy face .
perfect fit for galaxy note,  but when heated from sun it became so loose and you can not adjust it to the angle you want .
This product is a genuine Dell product and is exactly as advertised.I would not hesitate purchasing this product again if needed .
I bought Nupro powder instead because I ran out of Glyvo-flex.I will never buy that again! I will  buy glyco Flex from now on.A big fan.Pills are so much easier than smelly powder .
I am soo delighted with this electric broom.It has great power. I like the swivel head , not too noisy. The dirt cup could be a little bigger so I empty it every time I use it.No big deal.Nice long cord.Don't hesitate too buy.It's definitely worth the price.Thanks Hoover I was worried I would have to spend a fortune for something with quality. Great buy .
I lost a palmtree necklace, tried to find a store to replace it to no avail.I wanted something  dainty and with good quality.I was hesitant but I  am so pleased! I get a ton of compliments.It's perfect. I wear it every day .
I was expecting a bit more weight to these sheets but the color was great.Over all for the price not bad.! I would buy them again .
After about a week it shorts out,this is the second one with the same problem.Do not waste your money or time .
I purchased this case for my wife's new evo 4 3d. I wanted to make sure the front glass and the two camera lenses on the back were protected, and what better way to do that than with an otter box:) not to big and bulky, and it does the job .
Nice product, love that they look so natural! Easy to put on and they last a long time.Great product, wouldn't use anything else .
its great!!! i purchased it for my 12 yr old girls...cause i didn't want to get anything to expensive...but i would purchase it for myself...the only thing i suggest u do is go thru it to make sure there was nothing that  was downloaded that might be inappropriate for kids...it also fits gud in the case witht the keyboard attached...other than.that..the touch screen slides bk n forward easy...color on screen ..wonderful..IT'S A GREAT PRODUCT .
tthis item was shipped in a timely manner..the 7"tablet a Zeepad fits great on the slots that holds the tablet...one thing to notice...is that...the lights don't come one at once...but after about 5 min they come on...it charges from the tablet...i purchased it for my 12 yr old girls..i am satisfied wit the purchase .
First, you were recommended by my best friend for 63 years so that was a good start.  I have received all of my security items and have found them to be sturdy, reliable, and perhaps most important, easy to install.  I had one glitch with my order that was taken care of the same day by a very nice young lady in customer service.  Online ordering of my system from a good choice of products was very easy.  I could track shipment via email that was sent to me and the package arrived in good shape on time.  Not a single item was damaged.  Instructions to set up system are outstandingly easy.  I have already recommended it to several of my other friends .
I originally had four of the under the counter lights but soon found out that they are so handy I purchased two more.  I have to admit that none of mine are "under the counter".  I have them just inside my closets and the utility room that is usually quite dark.  I have two that I place around the house by setting them on dressers, end tables, or anywhere I may need them when I get up very early in the morning or anytime at night.  I sometime use one as a very handy flashlight when I enter a dark room.  I have been very pleased with the ease of purchase, the ease of installation, customer service, and how long they last.  For a small light they put out a tremendous amount of bright light .
This is the best wallet/phone case I've used.My ID and credit card are easy to get to and do not fall out, plus I have a place for some cash...I don't have to carry a purse if I don't want to .
Liked the case but broke too easy when removing my phone. Not sure if I'd purchase this one again. Would have loved other than that .
To begin with, PS4 was very difficult to buy. Amazon received some stock from time to time but minutes later they were already gone. I bought mine in January and received it within 3 days.The console itself is great - the looks, the way it works, etc. One of the things I like the most is the ability to plug in your headphones directly to DS4.No 'blue light of death' so far :) (some people experienced this problem during the first couple of hours of using PS4) - I've been playing AC4 for about 40-50h now.Overall, I'm very satisfied with my purchase .
The book was new, not used at all. The price was excellent. I will recommend it to any student. I have rented before from other websites and paid so much and at the end you need to return the book. For an excellent price the book is not only new but you can keep it as it has very interesting topics for Teachers .
The cover is very nice and smooth in the hand. It prevents the phone from turning off whenever the phone is placed in hard surfaces. I dropped the phone once, and nothing happened to the phone. The price was good too .
I love this game! I thought at first that it would be much like it's sister game "Diner Dash", which I also like, but Wedding Dash not only has the character Flo from Diner Dash, and the similarities of having to bring guests their meals quickly, but also the bonuses of getting different guests with their own personalities and preferences. Though this adds its own extra challenges to the levels, which increase in difficulty as you go on, it also personally makes the game more interesting and enjoyable! I've spent many an hour attempting to not only reach the goals needed to pass each level, but also to pass the "expert" goal. The free trial gives free levels in one venue, while additional payments unlock different wedding venues. Very addicting and fun game .
Started out good, but the ending wasn't. It had a lot of twists and turns and I wasn't sure who was the good guy and then I figured it out. I felt like it wasn't really finished .
This is an excellent read.  It starts out fast and is fast-moving all the way through.  I couldn't put it down .
This is a most informative book.  It details how to prepare the fruits and vegetables. It explains how the body uses the produce.  There are so many recipes, you won't  make the same one twice in a month, unless you want to.  Very well done .
I like the song.  It has a catchy rhythm.  My granddaughter loves to dance to it. It does have one adult word. Not serious though .
My order arrived within the same week which was a big plus. I was alittle hasty keeping my fingers cross hoping I didn't get jipped.  The life of the ink seems to be lasting its expected time. Being that I'm using the cartridge for my work. Only problem is the quality of the ink is not very good. Its not as black as a brothers or hp cartridge its more of a faded to charcoal gray color, for me and my customer's its no biggie though. You can't beat the price .
I have been using this product for 2 months. It has supressed my appetite but have lost no weight AT ALL. I'm going to have to try another brand .
I decided to try these heads after reading many reviews, and knowing I wanted to give Evans another try but go clear this time(my last heads were Onyx and left me with mixed feelings) I've only spent a few minutes tuning and my toms already sound much better than before. Great sound, and a good price. Not sure how long they'll hold up but my next heads will definitely still be G2s .
This book has it all... suspense, thrill, history, and romance. I couldn't put it down! Looking forward to the next novel by Joseph Halsted .
One of the only toys my dog couldn't tear apart in minutes! A few weeks later and its still intact .
I don't typically read political fiction, but after reading Joseph Halsted's "Last Voyage First", I was enthralled by the author's style. This book is certainly a page-turner... I couldn't put it down! I recommend this book to all readers... very thought-provoking .
these aren't as soft as i expected. will probably soften in wash. doesn't have a normal hem like the ones i purchased in a store .
these are not real hematite but hematine and should be advertised as such. like them anyway .
very comfortable. was afraid the waistband would be tight but it isn't. not heavy weight .
the colors aren't the same as in the picture and they aren't as long .
I bought this for my son for Christmas and I'm glad I ordered it with enough time to return it and purchase a different one. I opened it and pulled it by the handles to get it out of the box and immediately noticed that under the handles the plastic is sharp. The squares that you would hold with your hands is very uncomfortable just being squared in shape but it's even worse when the plastic at the underside of it isn't finished and has rough edges. This is not well thought out. I returned it and purchased the blue whale that has yellow plastic round finished handles to spare my kids' fingers and hands .
Great read. Definitely worth the time. I didn't know much about the trial and so the details of it were fascinating .
I found that the metal piece that goes through the holes on the band is too small and does not stay in place. Unfortunately I will be returning my purchase and sad to say I will not order a replacement as I'm afraid they are all made this way .
The Kindle Fire was exactly what I wanted. Books, movies, TV, even check Facebook. I don't know why I waited so long to get one .
Torhment is my favorite now omg he is so caring once he lets go I was upset when autumn went away but was a so excited when she came back can't wait til next book to find out about my boys oh yeah. I believe my next tattoo will be Torhment across my back I just love him .
the wrench it's not a universal size it works but not great really left me feeling concerned with stripping out my barrel nut  and it isn't a tight fit for my stock nut either .
the bigger ones worked better but the small ones were very soft and bent easily  didn't work well with my dead blow hammer .
The item only fits on my original full size not my kimber or my rock island I had to make major modifications toget it to fit the gun I bought it for and I'm still not completely satisfied withhow it fits after working it over .
i bought this in hopes that it would be comparable to the original beauty blender (which i have purchased before) and i was extremely disappointed. it doesn't get soft when wet and it makes blending in concealer and foundation very hard and doesn't blend out evenly. I'm very irritated that i waited 3 weeks for this to get delivered and end up regretting it so much .
I really enjoyed reading this series. i can not wait to read more about snow white i give this 5 star rating .
Based on reviews I ordered a size up (I usually wear Small in outerwear), so it fits just perfect. The coat is lightweight and well made, very warm, I highly recommend it. I love that it's elegant and fitted and not too sporty. Looks great with any clothes .
After product started getting air pockets for no apparent reason, I contacted Spigen thinking by them being a &#34;High End Product&#34; that they would replace their expensive product with no problem.. Man was I wrong!! They wanted so much &#34;Proof Of Purchase&#34; and after I sent them pictures and Amazon purchase # they still wouldn't replace my EXPENSIVE screen protector!! So They Will Never Get My Money Again and I Have 3 Iphones and A Samsung Galaxy 3 that i'm always buying screen protectors for but NEVER FROM SPIGEN AGAIN!!!! Maybe they just treated me like that, I don't know, but it won't happen again!!! Signed, Lost Customer for good .
Quaker Brown Sugar Breakfast Bars are the perfect snack, quick breakfast or late night craving.  The bars are seasoned to perfection. Everyone in my family loves them.  I have noticed the Oatmeal to go bars disappearing from every major grocery store shelf. Every time I would change grocery stores they were being discontinued. It was so frustrating!  Thanks to Amazon and the ease of ordering, I will never have to worry about it again. Thanks Amazon! Another happy customer.A.MillerTexas .
Best massage ever!  I have fibromyalgia and could not get through the day without it.  I definately recommend this product .
This game is a HO game, and as such is not outstanding. Some of the objects were too little or camouflaged in the background. The atmosphere and sounds were appropriate to the story of this game which was a gloomy and spooky one.It has a decent length to it. I give it three stars because of the graphics that could be better .
This game is a unique one, has a well made storyline that is relevant(UFOs phenomenon) and is not as gloomy and scary as most HO games are nowadays. The game has movie clips with real actors, in which you need to notice which objects appeared in them. It has well created HO scenes as well, graphics are clear and crisp, sounds are good. It is a lengthy game, and has a replay value. The developers of this game did a good job! I recommend this game to all the ones that appreciate the HO genre .
This very short story did not have any imagination and creativity. Erotic should be more interesting than just a tryout in writing porn. The plot was nothing exciting or believable. It was well predicted and silly .
It didn't work with my At&t, samsung galaxy s5.  I returned it .
Bought this tablet for my 9 year old son as a gift. it worked for 1 month and now its inoperable. Powering it on to the android symbol on the screen is as far as it goes. Won't proceed booting after that. Ive searched high and low for troubleshooting advice and have come up with nothing. I am beyond disappointed and angry .
Fun game to play with friends. Will keep you laughing for hours. Content geared towards adults so I don't recommend playing with children around .
I like the fact that the graphics are great and playing is really addicting. What I don't like about it are the ads that constantly crops up which is pretty annoying and you also need a fast and stable connection to be able to play it continuously .
It can get frustrating at the start but will certainly make an addict out of you especially when you have someone to compete with. It is just annoying when you have a long zombie line with you and all of them fall down because you cannot control them anymore with one tap .
I'm giving this a 3-star, would have given it a 5-star but my kindle fire hd keeps hanging whenever I open the application and have to restart for it to function properly. Otherwise, the pictures are great and crisp, it jumps out on you and you would love to try it out for yourself .
I bought this hoslter for my Gamo p25 blowback pellet pistol. It's made of good heavy duty nylon and stiching. The extra magazine holder is a plus. Would easily serve as a good holster for a firearm. Heavy duty velcro hold it in place on your belt, can't go wrong whether buying for air pistol or real firearm .
What can you say, it's the best CO2 on the market in, my opinion. I use them in a Gamo p25 Blowback, and they just seem to last longer than the cheaper brands, even though a blowback pistol is going to go thru cartriges faster than a none blowback anyway. This is the only brand I buy .
This is one great scope, it's easy to zero, and after about 200 rounds, thru aGamo Silent Cat it's still on the money. The only fault I could find is that the mount that comes with it is too low, I had to remove the front and rear iron sights to get an unobstructed veiw. I'm thinking about ordering the Instapark high scope mount, with peep thru, so I can put the iron sights back on. This was the first time I had heard of the Hammers scopes, but I understand it's a common brand in Europe, especially Germany. I can't say enough good things about this scope, I plan on purchasing a Benjamin NP rifle in the near future, the Centerpoint that comes on it is trash bound, this is the scope that will be mounted on it. You can't go wrong purchasing this scope .
This is a really well made knife, for such a low price, you can't go wrong. It wears comfortably in my boot, has a well made leather sheath, with clip. It's perfect for what it's made for, self defense .
If you are into biker jewelry, you will love this ring. It is very well made, fit perfectly. The detail of the Maltese (IRON) Cross and the flames down each sides are flawless.  You can't beat the price for a ring of this quality .
not as much build up as I would have liked. things happened too quickly and are obvious. some tip comes in of imminent danger then instantly it's happening. book felt rushed .
This case is really perfrct for any Daryl Dixon fan with an iPhone 4. I have had this case since before Christmas and it has been through it's fair share of drops, but the case has always held firm. There is not a single crack or scratch to be seen and, although it's a thin case, it has protected my iphone wonderfully.The one semi-negative thing I have to say about the case is it is a tad duller in color than its picture, however, it still looks very nice and I have no real qualms about the coloring. I am definitely happy with my purchase .
I will be completely honest... chapter 1 really lost me. I was not into the idea of a teenage love story, so I put the book away and decided not to read it. A few days later I saw a YouTube video of Teri telling her story about writing the book and where the story is headed. (YouTube link here [...] The video made me very curious, so I picked the book back up and dove right into chapter 2. From there I read chapters 2-14 without hardly breathing, I was so excited! I absolutely loved where the book went, and I am ecstatic anticipating the next books! Good job Teri .
To many cliff hangers in a short peroid of time.The story didn't flow as smooth as the river and falls .
This oil is okay. The smell doesn't last long. Only one day on a cotton ball. But it does smell good in a diffuser .
Classic old movie, very funny and heart warming, nothing you can't watch with a 7 yr old. Great family movie. A .
Questions were rather simple, &#34;What is your favorite food?&#34; etc. Not very thought provoking, but not too bad for long car rides .
Not a bad movie, but not great like the first. Still better than the second. My 7yr old loved it .
it pops off repeatedly, did not fit phone well, won't stay on this word count stuff is really really stupid .
I loved it, reminds me of my family but we are not that rich.  A must read for all Danielle steel fans .
Every game different  not as. Easy as it. Sounds. Pick which level you wantedBecomes a cha you don't want to quit playing makes you. Forget everything else and it exercises the brain .
Once I start playing I can't stop. Trying to finish levels in order. Plenty of different patterns, no two levels alike .
The light is much too directional and only covers a field of view of about 10 degrees each side. The microphone is very loosely held on its mount; it flops around like a fish out of water. The zipper on the bag broke the second time I used it and it's not big enough to carry, well, anything. I'm giving this 2 stars because the stand/mount/carrier is very versatile and I'll be using it often with a different light/microphone .
The battery, though a higher mA rating than the one that came with the camcorder, doesn't last as long. The charger gets points for accepting 12v DC and 110v AC power sources. The large tripod is a terrible, terrible joke. Even the tiny Sony HDR camcorder was too much for it and the storage bag tore the first (and last) time I used it. The tiny tripod appears to be a child's toy; placing any weight on the supposedly positionable legs causes them to buckle, unevenly, meaning you cannot aim the camera in any direction reliably. The mounting device broke the first (and last) time I used it. The SD card is fine, as is the USB adapter for the card. The bag, however, is much too small to carry even half of these accessories along with a camera of any size, and both side zippers pop open with even the slightest pressure. I have to assume the bag was meant to be a method for storing tripods during their trip to the garbage. At least that's what I used it for .
I really like this pink case. It is cute and it goes great with my iPhone. At first it was kind of hard to figure out how to get the cover on the phone, but eventually it will snap on. Also, they give you a plastic shield to go on your phone, but it doesn't work. Overall its a really cute case .
More of a photographic overview then expected. Hoping for a little more coverage of the filming and genesis of the films. The book is full of images I hadn't seen before, but very light textually. Still, highly recommended .
The worms arrived quickly, however due to a slightly ambiguous email from seller I thought they would not be shipped until the following week so the day they arrived I didn't check the mail.  The next day when I checked it I thought my worms were going to be dead because it was well below freezing that night and when I opened the package some of the dirt was frozen.  I got worried but then I spread the dirt out and let it thaw and in an hour or so all of the worms were wriggling away happily.  All of them were alive not one had died.  When I put them in my worm bin all of them burrowed and none were left on the top .
This is the one cd by Bon Jovi i didn't have. I love it especially the ballafs. Who ever is a fan should buy this cd it is great .
I love it. It isn't too strong it smells awesome. I reccomend it highly and i am very picky. I also like the fact it isn't over powering .
I love it. Its awesome. I've already dropped my phone a good five times and no cracks or anything. Looking good .
They are really really far from skin colored. They look almost yellow. Did not hide my gauges at all. Would recommend going else where for these .
Overall it wasn't too bad but the tip is white. so it doesn't hide the fact that there is a piercing. It is completely useless for me .
It showed up cracked and it did not match the picture very much. Overall very disappointed. I would not recommend getting these. They look like dark glass. The cracks aren't even there really .
This thing is beefy, heavy duty, and is awesome for T-bar rows and weighted chin ups. I don't even have a cable machine and it is very useful .
got these for my wife on mothers day. they are beautiful not too big not to small. i might have no get the pendant as well .
I am stacking this with pes erase and i am having good gains.  Only drawback is it is a pain to have to weigh each dose of powder. make sure you invest in a accurate scale. This stuff really needs to be put into capsules as it DOES NOT dissolve. i take it sublingually with water and it tastes citrussy and not too terrible though. Still good value for price .
Its no Bull-Nox or Hemo Rage. It is a servicable, but not great pre-workout. i use it on days when i am doing lighter training so i don't get burned out on other better pre workouts .
Good book. Kept you interested. Did not get bored reading it and  was always anxious to get back to reading it .
This system keeps my bras looking nice longer. Easy to use. Glad I ordered it as it saves mea lot of money not having to buy bras so often because they get beat up in the wash .
The book holder was great. It would be perfect and do the job if it was wide enough at the top to fit my treadmill. I wanted something to set my kindle fire on when I was on the treadmill and ordered this holder but it is not wide enough at the top to fit over the lip of my treadmill. Nice holder though .
Cutsie movie. Fun to watch but not much of a plot. The actors did a pretty good job but the story line was lacking .
I chose this review because the game is kind of fun but is very simple and not much challenge to it .
I chose this rating because there isn't much action going on in the movie. If it wasn't for Chris Rock the show would have been a really big bomb. Not worth your time to watch .
this movie did not keep me to interested but it was ok. Not as good as I  thought it would be .
This game is ok. Do not like the graphics quite as much as alot of these types of games but it is fun to play. The graphics are good and ot works well .
my computer would not load it as it said there was too much risk to have it put on my machine .
If it wasn't for the mini games there really wouldn't be much to this game. The only good thing is that you get 100.00 bonuses every so often so you can keep playing .
This book was fast  to read. Nice simple story lines. Would read it again. Wasn't much of a surprise but a nice simple story .
This is an ok game but there are so many more out there that are more interesting that I probably would not down load it again on my kindle. These apps do not run quite as good on the kindle as they do on the computer but they are ok .
Wasn't sure about this book but am glad I read it as it is quite an entertaining book. Light read that keeps you entertained .
I chose this rating because it doesn't work quite as well on the kindle but still works pretty good and I really like having several fun games to play on one app. These games are a little better than a lot of the apps I have for the kindle .
Got the game for my kindle. Play it on my laptop all the time so thought I would download it to my kindle. It isn't quite as good as it is on the computer but it is still fun to play and I enjoy it a lot more than a lot of the games I have. I like that there are several different games in one .
By far the BEST flat iron I've ever spent money on! Unfortunately my husband ended up stepping on it & breaking it (it fell in the floor & he was in the dark) now I can't seem to find it anywhere! :- .
I only bought this flat iron bc my husband accidentally broke my K2 flat iron. Not as great as the K2 but I like that it's more sleek & thinner. It's still a good flat iron though .
The charging station works well with our remotes (Nintendo and generic). I like that it plugs into the usb port on the console. However the battery packs do not hold their charge very long (maybe an hour max). Still better than buying a ton of AA batteries .
The screen protect itself seems to be durable and will last awhile, but it did not fit correctly it was too long so I had to trim it to fit my zeki 10 .
I usually buy my Lanza shampoo at the beauty shop-but decided to try it on line and somethings wrong with this shampoo-it does not lather up and it won't even go in my hair when washing my hair-it's in the same bottle that i get from my beauty shop-but whatever is inside the bottle is not the same stuff.  I love Amazon and I order all the time-but not happy with this bottle that I received from Mrs Goodeal's shampoo .
The K & N system installation into my 2002 Tundra went very well with only one exception - the hole in the tube for the mass air sensor was not properly placed in relation to the threaded screw holes.  I had to use a half-round rasp to adjust the size of the hole in the tube to allow proper alignment for the screws that hold the mass air sensor in place.  Other than that, the installation went well and the performance is what I expected.  Very satisfied with the system .
great graphics.. loads fast. no problems until i unlocked the 4th level game. won't unlock even w wi-fi connection..  ??? otherwise, awesome game .
To my uncle Albert I love the book this book is going to be so special to me because of my daddy last words to me was your uncle Albert made a book and call your uncle about it I wish my dad was a live to see that his brother book has arise I love you daddy and uncle Albert and the book was wonderfully I couldn't  stop reading it ! God bless .
the wrist strap would only go over a real small hand and the belt holster is a joke, the unit snags in the holster and has to be fumbled with to get out.  that takes security out of the picture.  one of the electrodes was loose, easy fix but just one more reason not to trust the overall quality.  i would avoid anything with this brand name .
I bought this game expecting skyrim with guns as many people called it.  But what i got was GTA on an island.  I liked the game but it didn't quite meet my expectations.  Overall good game but don't expect skyrim with guns .
my fianc&eacute; loves it he said he can't wait to get married so he can wear it and it looks great with my set ty .
I love the way it looks but it does not work  at all I will never buy this item again offline .
this is something I never used until now and omg this stuff works need to get more and I love it .
I love this phone I have no problems with it. its a great phone and I love the keyboard ! great phone .
this tablet does not stay on and shuts off when it wants to I do like the way it looks but its not worth the money I spent .
I rate this 2 stars cause I got this for my son and we charged it then he got to use it for a few hours then we unplugged it from charging and it wouldn't come on so we had to reset it and well im sending it back casue im not going to keep resetting  it everytime we charge thank you .
all product was not there I only got all Mags and that's not all it was supposed to be there .
they don't come with directions telling u how to sync to a ps3 or anything and it took almost 2 months to get here .
I think the book really had potential for a strong, emotional connection to the characters and their struggles. However, the main character's internal struggle with her sexuality is minimally discussed. In fact, the external conflicts are somewhat skimmed over and never resolved, so it leaves you wondering what happened in the past hour of reading. The ending comes across as if the author merely wanted to meet a page limit- no resolution, no cliff-hanger, just stuck in book limbo. The book as a whole leaves something to be desired .
I'm one of those women who was blessed with the darkest, coarsest leg hair, which begins to stubble literally as soon as I finish shaving. The second I step out of the hot shower, I get goosebumps and might as well have not bothered shaving at all. So, I have been looking around at other hair removal methods for summertime, but have been intimidated by wax strips of other brands. My sister (who has sparse, blonde leg hair) uses the Sally Hansen strips, and not only does the later redness look painful (it usually lasts a full day), but she has to go back over her legs several times to get even half the hair off. I vowed to never even attempt those!So, I did some intense research before deciding on a product, and these Veet strips seemed to have great overall reviews. Despite my first impression of wax strips, I picked up a box of these yesterday to try. After a bit of stalling, I warmed up the first strip and got ready to wax! It didn't necessarily feel pleasant, but I would call it more of an annoying sting than pain. Keep in mind, this was my first time waxing my legs, so I was probably more sensitive than those who have waxed before. There was virtually no wax left on my legs (just a little where the bottom edge of the strip was placed), and the slight redness lasted less than an hour. I only had to use one clean-up pad per leg, and even that was mostly to see how well they worked (if they got the minimal leftover wax, if they burned at all, if they left my legs shiny like the ad boasted). The pads did leave my legs super smooth and shiny, but my only complaint is that the floral/clean fragrance of them wasn't amazing. It wasn't bad, it just reminded me of my grandmother's perfume. The good thing is that the smell is easily covered with scented lotion. Anyway, this wax kit definitely exceeded my expectations and was easy for a first-timer. I will try to update in the future about the long-term use of these .
It's hard to hear thru the plastic I hate you can't fix regular ear plug thru the hold it's to big should be thinner and last hard to deal with .
These gloves are warm enough and seem pretty wind and water proof so far. The palms seem tough but the backside fabric not so much. Things that should be improved are the that the liners are loose and when you pull your hands out; the liners pull out too making it hard to put the gloves back on without some work readjusting. Also the finger tips have extra fabric on the tips making it really hard to work on anything small; I had to remove them when hanging Christmas light hooks and adjusting the volume on a car stereo can even be tricky. I always wear an XL glove and the XL in this case fits me well .
Seems like a great boot but it does not fit to size at all. Purchased an 8 but this at lest a size 9 .
The watch look seven better in person. The horn strap is very nice and overall this watch is very classy. It face isn't too big either which was a slight concern when ordering .
It's an easy read and entertaining enough to finish it but not very exciting. The characters are a bit too shallow to be interesting .
Finally a diet and exercise book that recognises that one size doesn't fit all, and you have to use scientific method to figure out what works for you .
It's a shame this stuff isn't taught in school, it's so sorely needed. I highly recommend this, there's a good reason it's so popular .
Be prepared to have your world rocked if you think that you are &#34;nice&#34;. Learn how you are actually manipulating others into liking you and not even really succeeding. Changed my whole world .
My daughter's and I have watched this movie many times over the years and never tire of it. I recently introduced it to my girlfriend and she has already seen it twice....oh Sandra .
Good read can't wait for the next 100 books. I will be waiting to buy each one of them. thank you .
The way the picture looks on the website, it looks like a bangle. Once received I saw that it was a small, itty bitty ring that I had no use for at all. Basically just gave my money away. I know next time I need to read very closely before purchasing anymore items. But I don't like the ring, it would not have been a choice I would have made hadI known it was a small baby ring .
Great book, couldn't leave it!! I hope you make some more books I can read, plz make more books with casey .
First of all when it came wasn't the brand I ordered. Poorly put together. Loud as can be. All I can say it works but for how long .
They met my uncle's expectation for his barbershop. I haven't heard him complain about any thing. He told me he like the way they are designed .
Give it a try, different twist to the comics books, probably a bit better, can't wait for the 3rd season .
Excelente libro de Pablo no hay comparaci&oacute;n drama aventura y suspenso todo en una vivenciaRealmente se lo recomiendo  a todos .
This is a multiple charger but definitely not a fast charger. I purchased it because i thought it was a multiple fast charger, it is not realy what i was expecting .
all i watch is local channels anyway by by cable billgreat reception no more adjusting rabbit ears i get 30+ channels and all the shows i want to see with no cable bill .
ONCE again James Patterson delivered a great story that kept you on edge tell the end great beginning middle and end I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys suspense action and intriguing story line this book is for you. Can't wait for his next book .
I like my product...I wasn't to pleased with the strong smell when I opened it but I washed it and wore it and it's serving it's purpose .
these knifes are cheap and thin, they  don't fit in block well.The cut is good but hardware on outside not strong .
Norton 360 becomes inactive when the computer is put into standby.  I have to restart the computer many times each day to reactivate.  Spent approximately 6 hours on the telepnone with Norton support trying  to correct the problem.  However, support was never able to come up with a solution.  According the the Norton forums, many people are having similar problems with Norton 360 .
My color wheel was defective.  When installed, the wheel would bind on the light tunnel and would not spin as it is supposed to do.  The TV would not start up.  I had to pay another $120 for a repairman to diagnose the problem.  It ran fine on his bench test but not when it was installed in the TV.  The repairman had to add a spacer on the wheel in order to pull it away from the light tunnel.  I wrote the vendor but they have not replied and they expressed no concern...only silence.  Had I known I would have to spend $120 for this wheel plus another $120 (plus gas and time) to pay the repairman to fix this vendor's defective wheel I would have simply bought a new TV set.  Buyer beware .
It does what it is supposed to do.  No problems installing.  No problems functioning.  I like when there are no surprises .
Dumb book. There was neither plot, nor substance. Where is the evidence of the so called &#8220;tough heroine?&#8220; I am glad this was a free book and I can easily delete .
Absolutely amazing... Buy a  truckers antenna with it.... I'm always in very remote areas I've yet to find somewhere I don't have full signal.... Just  buy the trucker antennas with it .
It was a really  good, no great book. I will never look at a cat the same way again. Erin Hunter is a great author with ton  of imagination .
It was a really awesome book and I can't wait to read the second one , called reached read this book .
It was pretty good, though it wasn't my absolute favourite. I suggest Finally. That was an amazing book  that I read over and over again .
Loved it!!  Could not stop reading! Extremely enticing book keeps you on your toes.  Cannot help but fall in love with Derek and Sofia together .
Keeps you lured in... absolutely LOVE this series... Cannot wait to start book 6!  There is always some type of suspense mixed with the romance part of the story .
This book was not as good as past works in the Artemis Fowl series however it is still great read .
It's entertaining for a few minutes but then it gets old and I want my money back. There is simply not enough content. I would rate it four if it were free though. It's fun but definitely a free sorta app. Waste of money .
This game is probably the best one I have but NEEDS a huge fix. I gat random pop up adds that will not close down, that helps ruin a great game .
This game is really fun! I really enjoyed it. I didn't want to stop playing. I would advisegetting this game. Draw a stick man epic .
I love this game, It's a building game but It doesn't get insanely boring after you make everything because it's also an adventure game. I love building games like townsmen but that got old, this didn't .
1 They are a lot smaller than I expected. 2 I can buy these pillows at wal greens and big lots for 5 to 10 dollars. When I saw the commercial it looked like something never made before but its the same stuff they use in those cheap pillows at the drugstore. So I was a little disappointed but it's OK. The seller was great!!!! Everything I wrote about that was a problem was my own mistake the seller wrote the dimensions and I expected something without doing my own homework. I am saving her/him the seller and I will be doing business with her/him again .
I needed a unit to drive a little stapler on my job installing Pool Tables.I looked at the Sears Evolve, the K-Mart somthing and the Harbor Freight something. They were all the exact same machine.My gut was telling me no and then I found this.Its very portable, does a great job and its not to over bearing to take into customers house.I keep it up front of my van between the seats and right beside me.My unit arrived in perfect shape...no missing feet, no busted dials ect. Ty Amazon .
Ok, so I don't usually write reviews, but this album is worth my time. Unfortunately, this record is something you probably won't find in your local christian bookstore. It seems as if all the good stuff is independent these days.(Of course, this is only my opinion.) Why won't christian radio take notice of some of these incredible artists who only want to glorify God with their talents? Anyway, I have heard several cuts from Lara Landon's most current album, "Overcome." Beautiful voice. I'm glad she has decided to worship her Creator with it. The sound of that album is more contemporary. This album, in which she collaborated with Magellan is completely different. Completely!! And this is a good thing. The album starts out with a completely original take on the hymn "Crown Him With Many Crowns." For lack of a better word, this is fantastic. The beats are incredible, reminding me of 90's techno. The feel remains about the same throughout the duration of the album. And I must add that their version of "Awesome God" is probably my favorite. Don't get me wrong, this is a great worship song. It's just that I've heard so many "lifeless" versions.  There is even a small portion of a song that reminds me of a Pink Floyd song. (My pagan days) As I finish writing this I am listening to "Glow."  I probably won't add too much more. This album is refreshing and I can't wait to listen to it this summer with my windows down. (I'm sure I'll look really cool at 40!!) Anyway, buy this album and support these two gifted artists who only want to share the Gospel through Scripture, hymns, worshipful lyrics and music that will most assuredly make the Heavenly Host shake their wings off .
This is Ellie Holcomb's first full length album release as a solo artist. Her first two EP's, &#34;Magnolia,&#34; & &#34;With You Now,&#34; were excellent recordings and left me starving for more from this incredible vocalist. Her first two EP's, by the way, are fantastic. Great voice, great worship,  full of Scripture. Why don't &#34;Christian Record Stores,&#34; or &#34;Christian Radio,&#34; play this stuff?! Why? Because it's not full of a  crunchy contemporary sugar coating. There aren't any tired cliches here or boring musical arrangements. Christian radio isn't for everyone I guess. I prefer independent and more obscure artists. And Ellie Holcomb seems to be just that. The first song, &#34;As Sure as the Sun,&#34; starts out with a vocal gently saying, &#34;There is good news...&#34; Amen to that!! This whole album is great and worth the asking price and more. I won't review every song, as you can preview them and form your own opinion. I will continue with the first song though. Ellie sings, &#34;You could never change, no matter what you do. You are loved, more than you know, more than you could hope for, after everything you've done...&#34; This song is a reminder of God's unending mercy. And I need this song. I need to be reminded that God's mercy chases away my wandering heart, which is forever prone to wander!! The rest of this album is just as solid. Full of reminders of who God is and who we are in light of His Word. (If you are familiar with Leslie Phillips, aka Sam Phillips, you will probably enjoy this album, as Ellie's voice is similar in sound.) So if you're still reading this, stop. Buy the record .
This review will be short and sweet. Very sweet. I loved The Cardigans since I discovered that they were the first band on the moon. As a band, they have released some incredible records,  &#34;Long Gone Before Daylight,&#34; being a favorite. I have always enjoyed Nina Persson's voice. It is truly original and very organic. I will not review each song in and of itself because it isn't necessary. This isn't The Cardigans and it isn't A-Camp. This is Nina Persson! With that being said, this is a fantastic record! Her voice is just as soothing as I remember it to be. You can tell her voice has matured and that is a good thing. It flowers some of the songs with a tinge of graceful raspiness. Just a tinge, mind you. In short, I am very excited about this album. Indeed, I hope it does well for her. Hopefully a hard copy will be easier to find real soon. You WILL NOT regret buying this record, so quit reading this silly review and BUY it already .
This whole series has given me just enough to keep reading, but not enough to be satisfied. I basically only read the final book just to see what happened. I was pleasantly surprised that I did enjoy a lot of the book. But the end really fell flat.*Possible Spoilers, but I'll try not to really give anything away*Let's start with the good. The plot is very interesting. This is really what kept me reading. I love Dystopian novels, and the world he created and the mysterious plot was really cool and definitely made me want to read more. I wanted to know more about the world, WICKED, and everything about them. Sadly, when you finally read about what they are doing, it's just not satisfying. Not terribly, but just a bit anticlimactic. I wanted something more. He doesn't explain the reasons behind most of my questions, like why do they have to be put through sooo many awful things, so many deaths, and so many horrible situations? And yet practically nothing good? What was the point of the people being able to speak to each other in their minds? How did this government get so many resources while the world is practically destroyed? He just barely describes what they were doing, but doesn't delve into them at all. Wow... I already set in on the bad of the book...Well here is the rest of what I think is bad..The character development is poor at best, just like the other books. The first definitely had it the strongest, not that it ever was too strong, and the sequels didn't improve. The characters are pretty flat. The interaction and dialogue between characters don't ever seem completely real. This could've been avoided if we were lead to really care about the characters. It's not the weakest character development, but it is one of the weaker parts of this book, and the series as well.I often am finding Thomas to be putting tons of care into some things and characters that I don't feel he should have. I'll try not to give anything away, but when a certain character tells Thomas that he hates him and tells him to leave him alone, Thomas says that it was the single worst feeling he's ever had... Really? There have been countless people dying around him, some that he even really cared about like Chuck from the first book, and he's been lied and hurt and betrayed by other friends and especially the girls... and yet this is the worst feeling he's ever had... I think Thomas has the Flare bad and it's been affecting his brain and his emotions far more than the writer is letting on.*Definite Spoilers*Okay so if you've gotten to the end, here is where I was dissapointed the most. Teresa. She was such a big character in the first book, and even the second. Now she's a nobody. The writer tries to bring back some bit of redemption and some kind of emotional reaction from the reader at the end. But Thomas doesn't seem to care when she gets smashed, and neither did I. Being such a big part of his life I figured Thomas would care a bit more... But nope. And then it was such a letdown. Three whole books of WICKED looking for a cure, and this last book title "THE DEATH CURE!" and yet nothing.... LAME! I felt like all these characters, every single one in the book went through this giant adventure and all this pain and suffering all for nothing... And where were they at the end anyways? Nothing explained. Nothing further to understand what's gonna happen to the characters next. I felt like it built up to a strong finale and then just fell down and pitifully ended. Very dissapointed with the end.*End Spoilers*Well yes, rant over. Like I said in the beginning, the book was captivating, kinda. But the end really let me down. I think with a little creativity, and some more effort, Dashner could've made something amazing, especially out of the end. But instead it felt like a first draft that was shoved out into the market .
Well written and creative! Loved the story for the most part.The characters are strong, especially Beatrice. Her thoughts and feelings are strong and the interaction she has with the others works well throughout. The story really drew me in. Seeing the different factions and how different they were and how they interacted was really interesting. How Beatrice overcame obstacles and progressed through the story made me want to keep reading more and more.The story is fast paced, the action intense and keeps you involved.Parts where I think the story could've been better were the character development. I think it was good, but it could've been a lot better in my opinion. I didn't connect with the main character as much as I would've liked to. Not that it was bad, because the character was really good, I just think it could've been better.The ending was okay. The emotions seemed off at the end. I felt it was a bit rushed. That was really the only time in the book when I wasn't connecting with the characters. The ending was left hanging for the next book.  If you're looking for a book that sums up completely, this isn't it. There will probably be a few more on the way. But it's definitely worth it.(Possible Spoilers)I think some parts came too easy to her, like the Capture the Flag game. I felt like it could've been more of a struggle and it would've felt like the victory was more of an achievement. The interactions between her and Four was good, but sometimes I felt like it was lacking. Also I felt like security in the area should've been better. It was far too easy for some of the more evil characters to commit violent acts against each other and get away with it.Overall I loved the book and would recommend it. Not book of the year but very good .
I WOULD JUST SAY DONT BUY CANT EVEN HEAR ANY THING OUT OF THE DAMN THINGS WASTE OF CASH SAVE YOUR MONEY .
Couldn't be happier with it.. Will be buying more in the future.. Came very fast.. Best baby shower present ever .
I love the convenience. I do not need to wash or rinse the reusable basket after brewing my cup of coffee .
Before I bought this, I decided to do a &#34;DIY Z Palette&#34; and I was so excited to make one but it didn't turn out as sturdy as I wanted it too so I just ended up buying this. Really happy that I purchased this. I use these for my MAC & makeupgeek eyeshadows/ MAC blushes. I wish it was just a little more sleek though but whatevs .
Very cute. So far hasn't fallen apart. Wish I could make the strap a little shorter (I'm 5'3") but otherwise no complaints .
Best sandals for the buck I've owned since being active in all water sports ! Easy fit and comfort not to mention it's casual style .
Hi I am 10 and love to draw this is thebapp I was looking for this is how i feel I was never good is school but when I draw the world goes away and I'm free from math and all the others I feel free like I own the world a world when I don't want to run and hide when the teacher calls my name a world when I don't have to read out loud so thx for drawing :D .
Plugged it in, followed the directions for installing (the ones in the product discription on the web site) and my xbox 360 controler found it and started working. The little disk that came with it was broken in half inside the box, but as it turns out, you don't need it so I didn't care .
I absolutely love this shoe!  This is my third pair in this particular style.  No 'breaking in' issues... These shoes fit comfortably from the get go!!  Looking forward to seeing some new styles, Aerosole .
I put this drill through the toughest work at coldest temperatures in Alberta, Canada and it hasn't let me down. Thanks Dewalt .
I bought this text book package for school, and though I really didn't want it, it suited my needs perfectly. It came promptly and in good condition. I would use this seller again .
I'm 5'4&#34; and 140lbs. I am curvy, so I bought a large. In hindsight, I would have been fine with a medium. My bust is really large but my waist is rather small so I usually have a really hard time finding costumes that fit correctly and don't make me look like a complete prostitute. I was really quite pleased with this costume. It came on time and in really good condition. My only real complaints were that the belt was WAY too large (but with two safety pins it was a super easy fix) and the boot covers would not stay fastened (but I ended up just tying the straps together and didn't have any more issues).All in all, this costume was a huge hit and suited my needs perfectly. I highly recommend .
To say that I was disappointed in this product is an understatement. I'm 5'4&#34;, 140 pounds. I'm healthy but I do have curves. These boots would not zip up! I've never had a pair of boots even be tight on my calves before, but these were ridiculous. As soon as I can figure out how to return them form my money back, I will be doing that.Don't buy these unless your legs are VERY thin .
So... this did not come with instructions in english. Haha I ended up having to match the Japanese (?) letters as if they were symbols to the directions we were given. It looks really nice on my wall and I get a lot of compliments, but the assembly was a complete headache .
I am very happy with my purchase. I ordered this case and keyboard to use with my iPad so that I could take notes on my iPad. I am a college student that does a great deal of note taking per day. I was very pleased with my purchase. The case is a great color and the keyboard is awesome. There was a small readjustment period where I had to get accustomed to the keyboard because the keys are a little smaller than average and the shift key is a little farther over than I'm used to, but it really wasn't a big issue. The only thing was that I had to order a stylo from a separate vendor because this one didn't come with one, but it was terribly cheap (like $3.00) so I wasn't too upset about that.The package arrived on time and in perfect condition. All in all, I have no major complaints and would definitely order from this vendor again .
The roadster 2 works fine when its on but when i return to my car after a period of time it does,nt come on. I have to shut it down manualy wait a few minutes and it comes back on.It doesn't do it everyday but at least two,three times a wk i have to do this. Batt is in high charge and phone is on. Im not happy w/roadster2 at all.Its hard to answer the phone when the darn thing is nt on As of this month8/23/13 the roadstar sucks I would not recommend this item to anyone.The problem has been there since day one.I know now its to late to return item but for anyone that wants  one deont do it because all my friends are having the same problemEarl Garrant748 oneil rd. west chazy ny 12992 .
no complants from me on my part. t seems to be doing the charge I wanted but it does not hold a charge as long as my old one  I phone 4. The I phone 5 batt. depleates very quickly for some reawson but im manageing ok .
NOT EXACTLY WHAT I THOUGHT BUT WORTH IT! IT IS VERY FUNCTIONAL FOR COFFEE TEA OR ANYTHING ELSE NEEDED TO KEEP WARM .
THE CARS DON'T STAY INSIDE THE TRACK(TOO FAST) SO MY SON JUST PLAYS WITH THE CARS AND NO TRACK. NOT WORTH IT .
MY HAIR WAS TOO THICK SO IT DIDN'T WORK FOR ME. GAVE IT TO MY DAUGHTER. THANK YOU FOR THE PRODUCT THOUGH .
I would rate this app higher, but there is always problems when you have to update. The game updated to the Valentine's quest and now it messes up. It loads then after less than a minute it re loads. It just keeps on doing this no matter how many times you restart it. There is just so many days to complete this quest, but can't play to do it. Please fix this newest problem .
I have used this product in the past and loved it. It is the perfect blend of lotion. It does not have tingle .
I didn't care for it. It doesn't fit my phone the way that it is suppose to. I won't buy another one like this .
shouldn't expect much for this bargain price.  It will not win any costume prizes for sure, but might get your child's one big wish come true.  And thats because kids are easy to please .
This is very plush and high quality stuff.  While's its slightly pricey;its nothing compared to the new look your car gets.  And the wall to wall feeling inside is like you get in your living room.  highly recommended .
I have been looking to replace my old, hightech ipad2 cover with a blue tooth wireless keyboard for quite some time now.  But didn't want to spend too much a second time.  This cover is not only extremely affordable but it is actually very smart and handy.  I highly recommend it to someone who is looking to get something under $10 .
the manageable size makes it very portable.  For the first 3 weeks, my son used to call it his new iPad!anyway, the way the white, black and transparent board are installed in the frame is unbelievably bad.  All three boards are lose, and gall off anytime .
I use it in our basement. It blends in well with the color decor. It is nice looking and easy to assemble. No tools required.I am quite satisfied . It was a great investment .
I cannot seem to keep enough of the nuts. Everyone is enjoying them. It is a nice snack from chips .
My family all love cashew nuts. It almost seems impossible to find them without the salt. Thank you for giving such great options on all of your products. I can never run out , we enjoy it tremendously. It is a nice option from chips .
I bought this screen as a replacement for my cracked screen ( I slammed the machine shut) I was somewhat hesitant because of the price, however since receiving and installing the screen Ive been very impressed by the quality and colour of the screen. I would recommend this screen to anyone needing to replace a crack macbook screen and who isn't afraid to DIY .
Time flew by when I was reading this book due to the depth and comfort felt with each and every character. A book that has you empathising with people who are in situations that are, hopefully, totally alien to you.This book has you thinking of life styles and life choices from angles you never knew existed.I envisage Ellie and Coop having a wonderfully happy, contented life together and Katie eventually carving a satisfying life for  herself. But I am unsure if she would end up sharing it with Samuel or just devoting herself to being the best person she can be .
I haven't laughed so... much in years. This book is a fantastic antidote to the seriousness of the book it is mimicking. Hilarious, I am planning to keep it, on my Kindle, to enjoy over and over again .
Presidential  dollar coin collection  book find and as expected.  Ad says includes free DVD.  did not receive.  Papers with product says must send for the free DVD and pay another shipping / handling / processing fee.  this is not right.  again ad says free DVd  It should have been included with product .
the delivery time was ok the case look's nice . I bouht two of them but after aproximatly 3 weeks of wering the edges of case start braking . But for me was ok I say that for that monu you cannot uspect higher uspectations .
My daughter likes the jacket. However, the picture on the website showed a black jacket with hot pink on the sides. When the jacket arrived she was disappointed to see it was solid black. It is very soft & cozy so she decided to keep it because she did not like the other color options. If it looked like the picture I would give it 5 stars .
If you liked candy crush, you'll love this game even more. The best part is that it's free. I definitely do not regret downloading this app .
This story was amazing, I couldn't put the kindle down for too long. I loved it such a great read .
They were great. I Love the product. I like that there are not chemicals going into my son when wearing them .
They are so adorable. He can grow into them, since they are so big. But their great. Can't wait till he can wear them .
Read this in two days it was so good I couldn't put it down. Going on to the second book now. Hope it's as good as this one .
Ms Bouton journey is shared by millions of people.  It helped me better understand my frustration and the ramifications of hearing lossI especially liked the chapter on Cochlear Implant, and the depth of her research.  That said it is very readable and doesn't require a medical background.Her journey in the opening half of her book was tedious, but laid the foundation for what followed.It has focused my own journey...and where I need to concentrate my future energies.It should be available in ENT offices .
I have taken this product a couple of times since I had the product. And to me it works slow I'm going to assume.  I haven't seen any results since taken it. I do say you get alot of product for your money which is a plus. However I don't want to compromise the quality or quanity. So i went with something stronger as well. Also I read an article about these types with Garcinia Cambogi a and it had Dr.Oz talking about the products saying he stand it and it works. However the Senate or who ever she was said other wise. Meaning  the product doesn't work.  Wish I had the link to it.  I'm sure I'm going to be returning it soon because I need something that shows me results at about the 2 week time frame.  And I know I put in the work ..5xs a week ..2xs a day  and yes I eat right majority of the time.  It's too hot to eat heavy foods.  I hope this helps.  I say Trial and Error .
Can't wait  til part 3, this book had  me on the edge at all times so looking forward to finishing the series .
It's not everyone's kind of music, but dam does it go in hard with really addictive beats harmonies, and powerful words. if you never liked Rundgren before, this album is a good reason to. he's an innovator. the technology aspect to the cd feels primitive compared to nowadays, buts still interesting to remix the vocals and beats, not to mention this stuff was cutting edge back in the day.  it also came really fast and in the original package too, always a good thing .
Well, there really isn't much I can say.  I got the game in a timely manner original case and all that, and there's nothing wrong with it.  I think this game deserves a 3 out of 5 because the actual game just kinda sucks. I mean, you figure that for Dreamcast the graphics would be better, and that there would be a more in depth storyline. It simply put falls short of other versions.  Honestly, I miss arcade systems .
This game system, o how it was slept on it in my past life unfortunately.  PLease Dreamcast, never go away.  PLease stay, please stay, please stay.  It came on time, and there was nothing wrong with it .
It came in original package, which is always a good thing. it works fine, brand new as promised. its useful for typing of the dead, which i was obsessing with when i had the keyboard. i don't know how many other games use it besides a few shooting games, but it sure was great using it for typing of the dead .
There are so many things to say about this game I'd probably go into it for another 30 minutes if I weren't short on time.  This game is a winner through and through.  The graphics and the music are both terrific, and the control scheme is exactly what it should be for a 3d Sonic game, unlike most of the new ones coming out on Gamecube, PS2 and all the newer systems.  This is the one that came out before all those, so it rightfully deserves credibility.  Even if this game wasn't very good, it would still be a must have just to showcase what Sega's dream was, but they perfectly portrayed that dream with the Sonic Adventure.  The story is a little weird at times as in not explaining things not to mention the ending was a bit corny, but who cares?  This game is a LOOOOOAAAAAD of fun.  If you want the ultimate Sonic experience, then you need to have this game.  It cost a little extra to get the original case, but it was definitely worth it.  Alright Sega .
This game is original.  It has cool characters and a nice range of attack and weapons.  Starting off you play with two usable characters. One is weaker yet faster, the other is slower yet stronger.  The only thing i have against this game is the fact that the music can be really, really annoying, and the control is a little stiff. Oh, and you'll get stuck in the early quarter of the game.  I still don't know what to do .
This game gets a 5 out of 5 for several reasons.  One, it looks great.  Whoever designed it obviously thought highly about it and didn't mind poking fun at Pac Man quite a bit, which either works to your advantage or disadvantage depending on scenario.  Pac Man is basically  your pet; you have to instruct him where to go, how to react in situations and help him escape trouble and do Mrs. Pac Man's bidding.  It's a family oriented game, and does not have your typical control scheme.  Pac Man will walk himself and you just point which way to go.  Sometimes Pac man gets scared, happy or sad, and it depends on what you make him do, and how you do it.  I don't know how to classify this game exactly, let's just say it's one of the great ones.  The way I see it it's greatly underrated.  In fact, the only problem I have with this game is how it freezes and resets itself constantly, which I assume is because it's so old.  So, renew this game on some newer models on the Sega Master system, and you're on your way.  Did I mention you can play classic Pac Man on this too? Of course I did.  It gets a 5 out of 5.  If you have a copy, keep it because this game should go into your chronological order of Pac man in Pac Man world. Definitely a fun game .
Alright, so I was looking for a Sega Dreamcast game that would peak my interest enough to get me obsessed with it, and this is one of them.  The music and gameplay is amazing, and the impressive graphics are seemingly flawless for the mystical fantasy rpg style this game has to do offer. Throughout the game you meet characters from different games who you can switch the main charcter with to clear levels.  Levels are caves, condemned buildings and palaces with dungeon chambers on the inside as mazes.  You go from one room to the next fighting enemies and capturing ones at your leisure to train for fighting.  At the end of searching the entire area, you fight a final boss, who you should be able to beat if you've leveled up enough.  It takes good tactic skills to ensure your victory as the game progresses, and knowing what armor to be equipped with.  By the way this game DOES NOT have a good case for armor either because you can collect barely any items without having to drop another one in exchange, then using it, to acquire the next item. You try to preserve and contain your list with healing items, but this in turn requires another sacrifice.  This is one of the only super annoying things about this game; that is the limited  bag to hold items.  You will find yourself repeating some levels over and over again because well, simply put, you weren't strong enough.  See, this game has a certain technique to it that you have to master.  It's called avoid as many enemies as you can unless you know they are weak and will level you up.  Otherwise you're gonna make super progress that amounts to nothing once you die!  What Timestalkers, you never heard of checkpoints?  And why is the main character so annoying?  Otherwise this is a must have classic.  It's the original disk, unlike the replica put on Ps2 .
it came in the original, as if i haven't said that enough times. I'm such a fan of original art.  So this game feels like it came straight out of japan.  The story is fun, and game play is cool.  This one is definitely best on multiplayer .
I love this game. sure it was a little hard trying to find out what to do, but all in all the story is amazing with really good cut scenes. the  controls aren't bad, and the first person shooter mode is cool too. starting in the middle of nowhere in the winter means you do a lot of running in the snow, and you may run out of patience, but if you can just give the game a chance, it' worth it.  Also, if you analyze the game closely, it really feels more like Resident Evil. I think this game was created before those, and the creators of Resident Evil were inspired.  I feel really satisfied and accomplished playing this game, even if i only got the first disc. all in all there's a total of 4 of them, and it will leave you wanting more. It didn't come in the original package, but for the price it was worth it .
While the PS2 version is a little easier to play, and English subtitles can be annoying to read all the time, when you're dealing with an original classic, who cares?  You can easily get used to the controls, the graphics lag in no way whatsoever, it came in the original case.  Did I mention the game is original?  It's a greta beginners item to the franschise, and truly showboats how impressive the Sega Dreamcast is .
If you're looking for revolutionary gameplay, this is not the game for you however, it does have an interesting story as well as good music by Bowie with him as a character in the game.  It came in on time and works perfectly.  Very interesting story and a good edition to the Dreamcast collection .
This game was so explosive when it first hit shelves, the rumor was that the creators spent over $8000 just to make it or something like that. It's a story of a young man who is on a journey to avenge the death of his father, and well, it goes from there.  The graphics are highly stylized in and located in Japan, where you talk to people, ride motorcycles, play arcade games, train, hunt people down, make phone calls and more throughout different towns and villages.  This is just the icing on the cake, but let's say the amazing thing about this game is that it emulates real life so perfectly and on such a deserving system,  It has I believe, 4 disks to it, and I wouldn't dare leave this life without one.  Very good game.  A must have .
This game has as many quirks and defects as a game could get.  The graphics and illustrations look like they were done by an 8 year old.  The story is wild and wierd.  Unfortunately, it's just not good enough to play without a few beers.  You'll find the control and special moves in particular are awkward, and if you never heard of Jo Jo's Bizarre Adventure, this game in my opinion, is no biggie to miss.  If you're a collecter of wierd and random things however, you should buy it .
Simply put, this game will make someone extremely happy to own.  However, as far as graphics and gameplay, I could pass up on it.  Still, this game would be terrific to watch someone else play, and it came in the case and all.  As always I'm a fan of original casing. So, although I don't care for these early models of fighting games, it works out okay.  Ultimately I was addicted to SNES Street Fighter, so I can't help but be a little unimpressed.  Still, it's a good game and recommended .
I chose 5 out of 5 for this because this game is original, traditional fun.  This is one of the few 3d games for Sonic the Hedgehog that actually satisfies.  A lot of people say it's a rip off of Mario Party, but they're wrong. While it does share a few of the same elements namely because it's a gameboard based platform game, the music and overall experience is totally different. In this you shuffle cards, you don't hit dice.  In this game it's wittier and more intriguing.  It is refreshing and interesting to see how Sega woulda have done it. The intro to the game was nice, the story is fluent, and some of the minigames are a little odd, while providing humor and fun.  There's a bit of button mashing but not an awful lot to hurt your thumb or get sore in your palms, and the controls were developed well.  The levels were pretty kool. I really liked playing on the ship and the train, and in outer space. The other very exciting thing about this game is that when you fight the boss, they still have an actually boss area, with switches you must hit, not to mention that all Sonic's friends (Knuckles, Tails and Amy) get to join.  The boss and story to this game was very odd yet satisfying. Great job Sonic .
what can i say, its a classic and works smooth. its fun dancing and singing, but you'll be rendered helpless if your maracas or sensor don't work, as was the case for me. it's also VERRRRY loud so be prepared for that too .
You can play it online. That's the benefit of having this.  The control is terrible until you change it, as well as how fast your character moves and jumps. It's hard to shoot targets, and the story is a classic.  Cool collectible but not extremely playable .
Not only did this come in the original package, but  this game works perfectly.  You gotta love the arcade version, but in my opinion this is better.  It gives you a super rush every time you're trying to type sentences and difficult words in seconds before you're clawed  and killed by zombies.  The characters are memorable, and it's fun looking at the agents with their keyboards.  If you need to get your adrenaline running, typing of the dead is for you, not to mention it'll upgrade your typing accuracy for life.  Talk about a creative idea .
The greatest Spiderman game ever made? I don't know about all that.  However, back in the day when we were playing the Nintendo 64, this game was a pretty big deal.  I always wanted to see this game redone with perfected graphics, and the Dreamcast version comes pretty close to it.  I mean, it looks like PS2 basically, and this game started 64 bit.  Nice going, Sega.  You're SpiderMan and of course what does Spidey do? Wall crawl, explore the skylines, beat up baddies, challenge villains, and rescue damsels in distress all the while managing a hectic college life and part time photo journalist.  In this game you save hostages, climb, swing, crawl and explore various levels while encountering different other Super Heroes such as Daredevil, Punisher, and Black Cat.  You fight a variety of Spider Man villains; namely Dr Octopus, Mysterio, Venom, Scorpion, Rhino, thugs and snipers.  It has a lot of beating up and switch finding in it.  Surprisingly the control scheme is alright though a couple spots here and there can be a little confusing as to where you're supposed to go.  It's a classic beat em up game, with original voice casting from the show.  Listening to Stan Lee narrate is always cool, and it has a lot of features from other Marvel characters.  The biggest improvement is the graphics.  They were terrible on the N64.  So if you want a better looking version of this game that has pretty much no control trouble and a fast paced, easy and exciting story to get into, this game is for you.  By the way, the Carnage battle at the end of the game is pretty lame.  So is the run from Dr Octopus at the end.  Just sayin .
If you're a Shadow Man follower like myself, then you know you gotta get this game.  However, it doesn't live up to Shadow Man Senior.  Let me explain.  Shadow Man is a black guy from the city down on his luck after failing his college courses, and squandering his resources with gambling and booze.  When a line of ShaMan and a Voodoo Priestess get mixed up in the line, Mike is transformed into the ShadowMan, Lord of DarkSide, or hell basically.  But with great power comes great missions and ShadowMan is required to collect Dark Souls before A certain demon named Legion does, and create demon humanoids bent on turning the world into a fiery carcass carved out of hell.  This game has tons of blood and gore, and VERY CREEPY sound effects, such as clawing people and pigs squeeling or the detestable screwing and surgery done to an infant somewhere in the back.  You also have to acquire different powers that enable you to do things such as swim in lava, climb walls of wire and coal, climb blood waterfalls and more.  This game is one OF THE BEST GAMES EVER developed.  Control appears a little stiff at least on the N64 version, which also has terrible graphics for this game.  I have heard the PlayStation version is way worse as well.  So, do the smart thing and grab it on Sega Dreamcast!  It's obvious a lot of care was put into this platform, voodoo cursing, biblical testing serial killer chasing game.  So the first one was A BANGER.  What about ShadowMan 2?  There are some cool new elements to it.  I like the fact that Shadow Man is bigger, and the special effects added to him when he enters Deadside is cool.  What is a little irritating are things like not being able to hack through wood with a machete, fighting three or more enemies all at once using unimpressive and unimpressive control scheme for fighting as a human, and dark region areas.  Even brightening the screen didn't do much for me on this game, because you'll still can't see anything. Even if you do manage to reach checkpoints and discover a few new levels and secrets, all in all it's super difficult to advance.  I cannot advance in this game yet, not even with the walkthrough.  By the way, if you find a walkthrough you're lucky like me, because it was almost impossible.  So if you love Shadowman and want to rise to the challenge, go ahead, buy it.  But this game is waaay too hard before it actually gets started .
This game gets a 5 out of 5 because it's simply awesome!  The music and graphics manage to develop a world you're immediately sucked into, not to mention I like all the main characters.  If you like Final Fantasy, I consider this a must have .
You know, people talk about this baby like it's a total abomination. It's courageous I'll give it that, and it also was innovative around a time when no one wanted to do add ons. At least, not till Sega did it. So I give Sega props for 32 x. I don't think it's ugly, in fact, I think it looks neat and easy to hook up. 3 cords are a little over bearing, but the bigger issue is getting the thing to work. It does not like to work. I'm being so serious. You have to clean it with alcohol and try again and again and again. But hey, it upgrades the Genesis and makes some games sound really good, like Mortal Kombat 2. Great game by the way, though I've heard people don't like it. All in all, I give the 32 x a thumbs up because it's a nice touch for Sega and some of the games look really kool for it .
Well, it's original.  It's different.  It's terrifying.  It's daring.  It's animated.  It's sheer joy.  This game pretty much pushes the power of the PS2 to the limit.  I received it in the original case of course, and it wasn't too expensive to buy honestly.  If you're a PS2 collector, adventurer and like fantasy, you got to have this game .
This game is one of those discs that, if you never heard of it before or played it, and heard the great reviews from other gamers, you'd probably think its top of the line.  For the 16 bit world, it's not bad.  It has some really nice extras in it; the music when you fight Dr. Robotnik is fun to hear, not to mention some of the music from the other levels when you travel through time, and the graphics are nice and colorful. OVERALL HOWEVER, the music comes off as slack, the levels can be dizzying and annoying to tamper with, and Sonic does not have the lovable easy speed mode (you know, where you simply hold the dpad down, and rev up with the "a" button? It's more difficult to do in this one.  You have to play it to know what I mean.  Sonic the Hedgehog 2 did this PERFECTLY. WHY NO ONE DUPLICATED THE PERFECTION OF THAT GAME IS BEYOND ME.  Plus, the 3D effects were really too early on to be terribly impressive. This game would have been better perhaps simply as a model for gameplay to come, not as its own independant disc.  Overall, as a Sonic fan I had to buy it, but it's not on my greatest games list.  You gotta be better than the old games Sonic, otherwise, you'll always get slammed.  Now the game is not impossible to get into, it's just that it needs perhaps a better introduction and cut scenes.  Without these the game is not that captivating, though it is a little refreshing to play a Sonic game that requires more accuracy and brainpower in spots such as in Casino levels when your'e bouncing off springs and such. It's really hard to describe the twist and turns in a Sonic game unless you've played it yourself, and most everyone has, and arguably everyone has their own acquired appetite that may be satisfied by this awkward game.  It's not the worst and it's not the best. It's cool to have that extra glitter in the sparkles when you're invincible and it's not like the bosses are too hard to beat, it's just that the past present scheme to the game doesn't feel too significant and the game will trip you out easily with the level designs.  Besides that the past and future signs don't do much besides change the design in the back with buildings and such .
I mean, it's power rangers. Did you like them growing up? I didn't but then again, I have nothing against them now, so I figured I'd throw it in the collection. With what results? You get to listen to the Power Ranger theme song over and over again until you have to turn the game off. Otherwise it's kind of cool, especially if you never watched the show growing up. It's a great way to get some insight about the show .
I finally got the game to work, and it plays just great. I don't think I could ask for a better version .
It looks good and plays well.  I cannot complain. If you're like myself you want at least 4 controllers for your Dreamcast.  I recommend this sale .
It works just fine and arrived early, i have no complaints at all, considering it was not expensive either. Two thumbs up .
Simply put, the first Supernova is way better.  This one just doesn't have a wide variety of music.  There are some awesome classics, but they come inbetween few and many.  The music should be better.  Otherwise, it's,.....ok .
Not only is this game a great novelty item, but it's interesting and fun to laugh at.  I like games with characters, cheesy punch lines and innovative gameplay. This is one of them .
After reviewing the Sega Cd and watching someone else play it, its safe to say that you cannot expect much from this unordinary game console. So, what did Jurassic Park have to offer that most games on the Sega Cd don't? For one it has some 3D perspectives that were pretty neat for its time, not to mention the story and quest is solid.  It's nice to hear the Dinosaur Professor teach you things about all the different Dinosaur species.  It didn't rub off on me too well at first, but it eventually grows on you, and if you have a well balanced appetite for old and new things, this game should satisfy to an extent.  The graphics are nice; very well detailed not to mention you get to use several different weapons and interact with a good variety of animals through out the game.  The fun ends there however.  The puzzles you get stuck on in this game are some of the most irritating ones ever not to mention the game takes far too long to reload when you die.  The puzzles are irritating mainly because they are all more so about timing certain sequences and find that "EXACT spot on the screen."  That sort of stuff is what produces migraines!!!  To make matters worse, and to end this review, let's talk about the end of part three on this game.  Once you begin to find the Dinosaur eggs you need and realize they have to go in the incubator, you feel fairly confident you can get through this and finally end this rare and curious adventure. But then the ultimate glitch occurs.  You find after defeating the T Rex that next you go into a cave to pick up Raptor eggs.  You have night vision goggles and finally you can see where the heck you need to go,and it stops there. I even watched the walkthrough, which the player would not answer my question for me (???)  You approach a well where you notice a card you need to open the next door in the proceeding room.  Well, you can't reach the card; you have to throw two rocks in to raise the level, and THEN grab the card. And that's the problem.  There is no second rock in sight anywhere on the game.  I heard that perhaps in the water tunnel the second rock is around, but it's not there either.  So for me, the biggest problem with this game is you CAN'T FINISH IT.  Where the heck is 2nd rock for the well???  The game has nothing more to offer besides a few special effects that were new for the time, interesting facts, and some corky yet entertaining motion video.  Other than that, this game is a collectors item or for the birds .
Well, it came in timely, had no defects, and it looks great on the system.  Not a bad price either.  I suggest getting one for your slim as well .
Simply put, it came in perfect condition and works just fine.  You need the correct games and possibly the keyboard for it to work though. It didn't take long to come in the mail and the price was good so i recommend it .
This has got to be one of the most interesting games I've ever played for Sega. Not only did I never hear of it before I watched Angry Video Game Nerd in 2013, but surprisingly, Game Nerd was incorrect when he said this game was not fun to play. Watching stock footage does get a tad bit annoying, but you have to consider this is where all the new games got their ideas from. It's the equivalent to watching a story line for Resident Evil or Final Fantasy.  What's more interesting is how they did it because this was in the year 1993, before the technology was even close to what we have now.  You wouldn't believe how fun it is to watch these ugly zombies creep, run, jump, and fly towards you while you're desperatey trying to switch your ammo to kill shaman and restore your old soldier friends back to normal.  The movie is a lot of fun to watch on this with great one liners and a fake Jamaican and cheesy dumb blonde as a news reporter.  The fact is this game plays like a new video game. The only downside is you'll have to blow and clean your 32 x for what felt like a month before the thing would work. I think this is because they 32 x was so underplayed that it just doesn't want to work right away..poor guy .
My last Dreamcast burnt out on me.  I played it on and off for about 7 months, and then one day it just took a crap.  I even took it apart and put it back together.  Nothing happened.  When I saw this Dreamcast, and for a measly $65, quite frankly I was worried it wouldn't work.  Fortunately, not only does the product work great, but it even included a controller.  Since it's the sports edition, it came in black AND with the cords.  Now I got extras.  It was a good bundle, and arrived in a timely manner.  The only downside?  The button is a bit sticky!lol .
You're gonna need it in order to play the sega 32 x, so it better be good you know? I like it a lot. I mean, it came quick and I've had no problems, so who's complaining .
Well, what can I say really?  I bought a cord for my Dreamcast prior to these, and I wasn't happy with the results.  The RF adapter still works, however the one I had, not so good.  Every time I played a game the screen would have fuzzy hair moving up and down.  It discredited the Dreamcast's graphic ability since the first day I used that RF adapter.  Before I bought the AV cable, I tried researching ways to make the Dreamcast look even greater on HD TV.  The answer for that would either be the AV cable or a different adapter.  It's easy enough to look up online, but this baby here works just fine.  Not only does everything look great, but it came through the mail in a timely matter.  I have no quarrels over this product at all.  It's easy to hook up, and it'll go to practically any new tv .
Its super helpful to have these if you don't want your ears pierced, but you gotta be mindful that they do irritate the ears a tad bit because of the magnet, and do fall out quicker than an earring with a stud .
Well, they just don't feel the same as normal earrings. You can feel the metal tryna go through your ear, and its a little painful. They also fall out occasionally and you might lose them if you're not careful .
I didn't know where to start.  I wanted to record things, and had no money for an expensive digital camera.  When I got this, it satisfied me greatly. I recommend it .
Absolutely, above and beyond.  When I ordered 32x, I was worried about the cords. Thankfully, I found this immediately, and it works with no problems whatsoever .
I like it that it's easy to install it. I wish it wouldn't vibrate as much. I tried putting the rubber inserts that it comes with but it still shakes as I drive .
This book is awesome!!!!!!!!!!All of you people should read this book.Great job Jeff kidney.sorry if that's not how you spell your name .
I ordered a large tagine but received a small one. Very disapointed as we can't use it. They gave me a return authorization but it does not worth the time to return it . I will give it and ordered another one elsewhere.They dont give any measurements......Why .
Me parece excelente servicioRecibi mi Gift Card sin ningun problemaLes dar&iacute;a 10 estrellasNo tengo ningun disgusto por el servicio .
The phone inside the case moves alot I'm not able to text some words but other than that I love the case .
For more of my reviews, visit my blog [...]Laurel is fifteen years old. She is not an ordinary teenager. She eats only fruits and vegetables and drinks Sprite. Since she was a child, she was home schooled on her family land near Orick, California, but when her parents decide to move to Crescent City, she has, for the first time in her life, to go to public school. Her first days at Del Norte High School are difficult, but soon she meets David, the handsome and sweet science nerd and Chelsea. But a hump starts to grow on her back. At first she thinks it's a pimple, her first!, but it grows day by day, becoming difficult to hide. She soon discovers that a flower grows on her back. That's when Laurel is embedded in a tale of magic, intrigue, love and danger where she meets Tamani, a faery, and other evil creatures.Although the start was a bit slow, I could not stop reading from about the fiftieth page. I don't know exactly what happened or what changed, but it gets better. I started and finished it the same night. The idea behind the book is very original. I admit not having read many books about fairies, but the concept seemed pretty original to me. I look forward to learn more about Avalon and fairies in the next novels because we didn't learn a lot in this one.I loved, loved, LOVED Tamani. I think he's the reason why I loved this book so much. His dialogues made me laugh every time and his relationship with Laurel is so much more exciting and intense than the relationship of Laurel and the other guy, I loved every of their scenes when they were together! Their romance was charming. And I loved the end! For those who read the book, you may know why!Something I didn't like was how some characters reacted. The first scene I can think of is when Laurel tells David about her blossom. I found his reaction completely unreal. How could someone be so calm when learning something this strange...Still, it's a novel I recommend. It's an easy, light read, perfect for people who are looking for an entertaining book! I can't wait to read Spells! The book cover is really simple yet cute. After reading it, I can say the wings formed with flower petals fit the story perfectly .
For more of my reviews, visit my blog [...]One year has passed since Laurel found out that she was a faerie. Even if she has come to accept what she is, she refuses to turn her back on her human life. But she is summoned to Avalon and now has to spend the summer to learn everything about magic and the world. Trolls, romance and a lot of information in this book.All these descriptionsIn this book, the author really managed to captivate me with the sceneries. There were a lot of descriptions that really made me imagine the places, without being too much and slow down my reading. But she also managed to leave a little to the imagination. The scene, or rather scenes that come to my mind are when we discover Avalon. All the details and the adjectives Aprilynne Pike used made it looks majestic! I wish I could see this place in real.Finally some detailsWe discover a lot about fairies and their world in this book. It was necessary because we didn't have a lot of information in the first book about any of this. The world is so developed, I loved learning about Avalon, the different types of fairies, how this world works, etc.Some development for the love triangleI  loved what the author did with Tamani and Laurel. Their chemistry is amazing. Tamani says some beautiful stuff in this one, I like him he is passionate and sweet, he would do anything for her. I could feel the tension between them and I want to know what is going to happen with this love triangle! About this love triangle. I don't mind them in a book if it's done right. In this book, it's not about if it's done right or not, but more about Laurel. I loved her in the first book, but I found her terribly cruel with the two boys.Love/Hate relationshipI don't know what to think about Laurel anymore. As I was writing previously, she's cruel. I understand she has conflicted feelings about which one she loves but sometimes she does unnecessary things that hurt one of the two. I also found her careless even after Jamison told her to be careful. While reading, I found myself thinking how dumb she was...I really enjoyed the book even if Laurel was annoying. I can't wait to read the next book in the series and see if my intuition about Klea is right .
Laurel is now in senior year at Del Norte High School. Despite all that happened, she tries to live a normal life. But when Tamani enrols as an exchange student at her school, all becomes even more complicated.In my review of Spells, I was starting to dislike Laurel, I don't know if I'm the only one? Things got worse in this book. It's a pity because it's the only negative thing I have to say about the book, this book was a lot about Laurel's relationship with the two men, I didn't mind it and I loved Tamani as always.I can understand that it's hard to choose between two people you have interest in, but she's bringing it to the next level. Poor David and Tamani! And yeah, she's still acting careless even after what happened in Spells and what Jamison told her. She never learns of her previous mistakes I guess.I loved that some chapters were from Tamani's perspective. I think it made me even more in love with him then before. Laurel must choose him, I'm team Tamani even more then before!But the end&#8230; I want to read the last book now! For the first time in the series, there's a real cliffhanger at the end. I love cliffhangers even if they can be frustrating, especially if the book is not out yet. Luckily, this one is. And I will be reading it soon .
For more of my reviews, visit my blog [...]Calla Tor is a young Guardian of the Nightshade pack. As the alpha of the pack, she always knew one day she would have to mate with the alpha from the other pack, Ren Laroche from the Bane pack, to form a new pack and continue to protect Vail's sacred sites for the Keepers. One day on patrol, she encounters a human boy being attacked by a bear. Against the pack laws, she saves his life and in the process reveals to him the existence of werewolves. But when she sees him at school as a transfer student the next day, she knows everything will change.Love triangles everywhereA love triangle, again. I love it! We have on one side Ren, the handsome alpha male, and on the other side Shay, the beautiful human boy. Who wouldn't want to be in Calla's position and have these two guys after her? I loved the contrast of the two relationships, how with Shay it was sweet and with Ren more intense and physical. They each have something different to offer to Calla. I think I'm team Ren, but I'm not sure yet. I found Calla and Ren to have the same passion and they understand each other because of their position in the pack. And he's the "bad boy".Great charactersAndrea Cremer did a great job with her characters. First of all, I liked Calla. I think she's a strong and very loyal heroine. She knows what she wants and she doesn't let anyone tell her what to do. She wants to do her own choices. She's strong enough to tell the handsome and sexy male alpha Ren that she's not one to share with other girls. She also wants to be his equal in leading the pack. She was a bit egoist by moments, but I really enjoyed the book anyway. Ren, Shay, Ansel, Bryn... I also cared for all these characters.Lack of informationI was around page 100 and there wasn't any explications about Keepers, Guardians, Searchers, etc. yet. Luckily, it was easy to understand without these information in the beginning but I think the author should have introduce a little bit of information in the beginning.An amazing cover for a good bookThe book cover (the hardcover one, not the paperback) is just incredibly gorgeous. I love the purple color and the calla lilies at the bottom. I remember being totally in love with this cover when it came out. Overall, the book was good and makes me want to read Wolfsbane but something was missing for me to make it four stars. Maybe because the main focus seemed to be the romance and it's not enough for me .
For more of my reviews, visit my blog [...]We're thrown right into action from the first page. The book begins where we left of in Nightshade. It's packed with information. We learn about Searchers and their world, the real story of the war between Searchers and Keepers and Shay's role in all of this. Even if the pacing was slower because of all the information thrown at the reader, it was necessary, the author had to explain everything before getting into the plot. I loved learning about the truth at the same time as the pack. Some stories surprised me like the one about Ren's mother.Like I said in the review of the previous book, I loved the characters. It was the same in this one. I was anxious to find out what happened to all of them when Calla left at the end of Book 1 because I could very well imagine that it would not be good for them. I can only think of Ansel, Calla's brother...  The new characters introduced in this novel were interesting. I absolutely loved Connor and his humor even when everything was going wrong. His bickering with Silas made me smile. And what happens with Ethan, his evolution, is cute.Overall, it was a good read. I felt like nothing really happened. But the next book will be filled with action that's for sure .
Thethird book is action-packed. If you like action, you will be served in this one! There is almost no break, we go from one place to an other. There is no time to waste before the final battle happens. Between the planning and the hunt for the pieces of the cross, of course there was also a time for romance.Calla is still torn between Shay and Ren. When she's with one, she can't stop thinking about the other. I was a little disappointed with what she did with both men. She acted selfish and it was like she didn't think about their feelings. I think she should have done things differently.The end ruined it for me. I enjoyed the book so much, but I still can't believe what happened. I was really really really disappointed to read how the love triangle ended because it was one of the easiest possible way to do it. That's the worst ending someone could ever imagine. I don't understand why, I just don't.But a good read anyway. I think even with all the disappointed fans, you need to read it to see for yourself. One scene doesn't make the book. I was also pleased to see that Andrea Cremer decided to write a fourth book in the trilogy: Snakeroot and I will definitely read it! I'm intrigued about what it will be about .
Even if her grandfather Lawrence is now back in New York, Schulyer is forced to go live with her uncle Charles Force and his two kids to keep appearances to the eyes of humans. If the interdiction to see her grandfather and Oliver is not enough, Schulyer has to live with Mimi who hates her even more after what happened in Venice and Jack, her forbidden crush, who won't even look at her. The Conclave now knows that what Lawrence always believed is true. When an ancient source of power located in Rio de Janeiro is being threatened by the Silver Bloods, they all have to fly to the exotic city of carnivals and beaches to discover who is behind all this. Conspiracies, secrets and a lot of plot twists!There are a lot of books about vampires out there. This one is different from them. I feel like Melissa de la Cruz did something new and great with this series. What she did with the concept of immortally was really interesting. I never read about something like that. Vampires live a human lifetime then &#34;die&#34; until they are called again on earth. And they have memories of every lifetime. She also did some funny and plausible explanations of the myths about vampires, like why they catch in fire at the sight of sun (it's because they can transform themselves in elements like fire) or why humans believe in such things as soulmates because of twins in the vampire world that are meant to find and be with each other in every lifetime. She also mixed vampires and fallen archangels which I enjoyed.As for the characters, Schulyer is a great heroine. She loves her friends and family and would do anything for them. At first, she's not confident at all and throughout the books, she's becoming more and more confident about her abilities, but also about herself and her appearance. I love when we see an evolution like that with a character, it's essential in a series that characters change after what happen to them. My favourite character is Oliver. At first, I didn't feel like that about him and I wanted Jack to get the girl, but I'm not sure anymore. Oliver and Schulyer have so much in common. He's loyal, even after what he learns around the end, he helps her in Rio de Janeiro. He's perfect for her. But with what was revealed in his Repository file, I'm not sure I want Schulyer to end with either one...There was a lot going on in the third instalment! And the end. The end! I was so stressed with all that was happening! I had so many questions as to what was going on in this book like who is the man in the white suit? What is happening to Bliss? etc. The only thing I could do was guess. A lot was finally explained in the last pages. I had some things right, but there were some plot twists that I never expected. I have so many questions left and the end brings even more of them. I don't know why, but Bliss' parents look shady. What they did with the Watcher was weird, something is going on here, I'm sure of it!I really enjoyed the book and I have the next one on my bedside table, ready to be read. For me, it's the best book of the series so far .
The book hooks you from the beginning to the end.  Another great book in a series from Lynsay Sands.  I enjoy the historical books Lynsay Sands writes as much as her vamp books.  If you haven't read a good book lately give this author a try .
After reading the first book in this series I quickly bought all five volumns in the series.  You won't be able to stop reading .
I love this book couldn't put it down the only reason I didn't give five stars was for dialogue of all the characters seemed to be sarcastic which made a bit unrealistic to me, but good read .
I absolutely love these shoes I ordered them in red  they look expensive but They are definitely not . I can wear them with pretty much anything I want . Runs True to size, very flat .
I love the look and price of the case..very sturdy ,.however anytime u grab it by the top the case will split and cause your phone to drop. Considering the price I won't complain .
When I downloaded this app, I thought it would be show movies directly from the app, and not link to other websites.  That's just not what I was expecting .
First and foremost, it's a hidden objects game.  If you do not like such games, don't play this one.  It's also a Facebook game at heart meaning you can play so often.  All in all, it's not the greatest game, but it is decent .
Legendary is a deck building game from Upper Deck Entertainment, which uses Characters from Marvel Comics.  There are over 10 heroes to chose from, with 4 different villainous master minds to chose from, as well 11 villain groups and henchmen, and, thanks to schemes, has a different objective each game.This program is not a mobile version of the Legendary card game, but rather is a tool to make set up a lot faster.  What it does is it takes the available card groups available in the game, and according to the number of players (more players mean more cards in the villain deck), and randomly selects the Master Mind, and the scheme for the game; the number of scheme twist cards, the number of bystanders, the number of Master Strike cards, and which henchmen groups, and which villain groups for the villain deck; and which heroes for the hero deck.My biggest complaint is that I can't select 5 players, which isn't that big of a problem, since we only play with 3 or 4 players.  As expansions are released for Legendary, expect updates to come for this app .
I've used a lot of this kind of color, but never had I have such good results and long lasting .
Mine came in with scratched glass in 2 places and although the photo shows finished wood on the inner part of the top in the photo, mine was not and I was informed none come finished. Either this is false information or false advertising - either way, I am in the process of returning this item and as my title says - never again. And, it's cheaper at Target .
Does as advertised, but not up to a mile. signal improved tough. Yes worth the cost, very cost effective. John .
My dog has sensitive skin. This seemed to work well with her sensitive skin. Has a pleasant scent and didn't break her out. Seemed to calm her irritated spots, and even helped dry spots. Overall great working product .
I use to get this for my dog from the department store. You can no longer really find these at the store. This is a great deal. The price here is about the same as the store. Any way my dog loves these. I get her all three flavors! Im soooo happy I found these .
I chose the cucumber melon scent. This product is highly fragranced. The scent is very pleasant. This is also very moisturizing. You really only need to use a little at a time to get the job done. Also, my dog has sensitive skin and this did not break her out. So if your dog needs to smell better or has sensitive skin this is for you .
Three knives at this price, nobody is expecting a high-end performance.  For the price they look nice and fun for throwing at soft targets.  Probably smart to throw over carpet v a hard tile or concrete surface.  Don't plan on using these for a street fight, they're only slightly better than screaming for help .
The boys are just amazayn. When you think about it their was a lot of loans the boys had to take out to get this far. One of my friends thought that one direction was just stuck up and snobby  (how dare them I know) but when she read this book she realized that they really are caring and kind. I mean sure they have lots of money, but that's not the most important thing to them .
When I tried my thumb It wouldn't accept It, then I tried again and it worked. I don't trust it when I need to unlock my kindle .
it was still the wrong one but i won't send back because i dont have time to wait for it to be fixed again .
My rack did not survive the shipping process. When I took out of the box it was all bent up. I tried straightening it and one of the metal racks broke off. Needless to say it is still bent and broken .
This was recommended and I couldn't be happier. I love the southern edge and thought the main char were well written. Nothing was lost in over description the book actually moved forward without getting lost. Not an erotic at all. This can be read by teens .
This Charger SUCKS it does work with my phone it don't even charge I think it mess up my phone now my phone is not charging I'm so piss ... I will never order a charger off amazon .
My phone case was broke im not going to even waste my time with it. Sending it back would waste money and contacting the buyer is a waste of time. Poor packaging .
Yes, I like this package, is when I received when the price of $20, no difference to me, this let I regret .
I thought that I will not like Keds  I love them and I will recommend them to my family and I look forward to buying more .
i like the way it look online, but in person it was too too big on me and i did not like that part .
It was not true to the size, but that was okay my daughter was able to fit it. yes tell someone .
never had a problem with force closes on my kindle or my phone, app runs great and the game is fun .
fun. easy. runs smooth. great time killer. not as brain involved as candy crush but still requires a little bit of brain power. its fun for kids too .
"Sleep Yourself Beautiful" is a very very well thought out book. Not only does it give well informed information as to why sleep is important, but it also is a guaranteed hit. It tells you in detail, why sleep is so important. As well as also let you in on a few secrets as to why sleep will actually make you LOOK and FEEL better as a whole.The book goes into great detail about how the term "beauty sleep" is not just a random catch-phrase. It is a real thing. With health as the prime concern here, it tells you that sleep is necessary if you want to actually look attractive.My favorite chapter in the book was the chapter "What Are The Sleep Triggers" where it actually tells you what the body needs to fall asleep. Coming from a guy with diagnosed sleep issues, this actually hit close to home. We have all had those nights where you simply can't fall asleep, and this chapter actually goes into great detail about how to practically force your body asleep.I write all of this to say, this book is QUALITY. If you are having trouble sleeping, maybe you have been struggling with how your body looks lately, this will give you the confidence that it really is a simple fix, and once you are getting the right amount of healthy sleep, you will not only LOOK great, but you will also be 1000% healthier and might even extend your life .
there was nothing in this book that came with any surprise. the epilogue was far more interesting than the whole book. seems like the author wrote this just to finish up the mess she started with a mind to give Ana and Christian a happy ending.I still look forward to what will come next from EL. James, but only if it is unrelated to the damn fifty shades .
the details are not good,only one meaning for each word is given.Also, explanations and examples are required for anyone trying to learn a foriegn language. the sole purpose of the dictionary is not fulfilled .
its pretty awesome. its not just the concept but the way the story has been written. i just couldn't put the book down till i finished it .
When I received this product I was hoping I would be able to extend my laptop battery life, I followed the instructions regarding letting the battery completing discharge then re-charge 2-3 times.  After doing this the product was no better than my original battery of 6 years old.  The battery life was horrible.  The battery life did not extend to anything close to the times stated by the battery's description or by other users.Luckily, I was able to get a credit of $24 back from the vendor.  This was the result of a complaint I made to them regarding excessive costs at the USPS to send the product back to CA from MO.BUYER BEWARE!good luck .
When I first got the wallet, I was surprised by how big and spacious it was. I didn't expect nine credit card slots, id slot, and two secret compartments. IT IS AWESOME. Also, when I first laid eyes on it, I thought it would be too bulky and uncomfortable, but it was very soft and light even after I filled ALL THE SLOTS.It's a good wallet, people who are complaining are most likely just negative Nancy's or fags .
I loved this book because it held the gritty details of only a child surviving the mental illness of parental addiction could tell. It tells the story of how extremely difficult a child has to fight to survive day to day, month to month and year to year in the crazy chaotic world an alcoholic parent creates for their child.I would recommend this book to anyone who wants or needs a better understanding of the battle a child of an alcoholic parent faces or has endured.Thank you Marlayna for being brave enough to live through it and tell the world about it. You amaze me .
I BOUGHT THIS BOOK AS A GIFTFOR ONE OF MY BEST FRIENDS, WHO IS ALSO MY BOSSWE AM FROM CHILE AND WE ARE ENGLISH TEACHERS,PART OF BEING A TECAHER IS THAT YOU GET IN CONTACTWITH ALL THE ASPECT OF ENGLISH SPOKEN COUNTRIES CULTUREAND MY BOSS IS VERY FOND OF COOKING,SHE LOVED THE BOOK.

Did nothing against the odor. Even though I spot tested before use, when I actually used on a spot it left a yellowed area which was not there before.  Will try again to see if that result was not the normal .
I got these as a gift for a friend of mine. She loved them and wears them constantly. She has not described how comfortable they are, however when I was packaging them to give to her, the material felt soft and stretchable .
This book is great! I could not put this book down it was soo great and kept me on the edge of my seat .
I bought this corset because i wanted to try &#34;waist training&#34; and i have to say i'm in LOVE! It's super easy to put on by yourself, and the material isn't cheap. I'll be getting my next corset here as well .
Loved it Can't wait to read the next 3 books. They are full blooded passionate personalities. Makes time travel interesting .
Love love love it this one is made so much better looks cute and the spikes stayed on the back only thing is the spikes r starting to turn colors they aren't silver ne more .
This case doesn't work the way it's supposed to it definitely doesn't glow n the dark like it says and it was a waste bv I wanted it to glow n the dark .
It was a cute idea and item but it was made poorly it the spikes didn't stay on at all waste of time .
Love this piece it took some time to get it but it came from China and the seller was very polite but the crystal came out when I dropped my phone and it's no way to fix it it's easy to take off when your ready for it to come off but this product also messed up my home button it twist and moves and isn't supposed to but my home button still works .
I most absolutely love this case it's my most favorite and the delievery was fast I purchased it Friday and received it Tuesday and it was brand new still n pack very authentic might b the best cell phone case I've purchased n a long time bc it's pink and bejeweled I'm n love it was a lil expensive though that's the only thing I don't like I don't think it should cost the same price as the store on Amazon but other then that I like it .
The case is cute was delivered on time was a great price bc they cost like $30 in the store but when I received the item it didn't fit on my phone so it was a waste of my .
Childhood favorite and brought it for my little one he really likes it! Hes only 3 and is reading it cover to cover already (by memory) Mines didn't come with the paper cover over it but It still had a cute little design! Good buy .
Got it for my 3 year old son! yes I said son He saw it the library and loved it! Hes a big reader and ranges from superhero books to five little monkeys to fancy nancy. Its really good for young kids and He loves saying the fancy words and repeats them to his older cousins and it makes him feel superior! I love them! great buy and perfect size for smaller hands ( Not too big, not too small). Overall I am very pleased and recommend these books for young girls and boys .
Nice price. Great book for beginners. My three year old isn't that into it compared to his other books but his cousin a 5 year old really likes it so I guess its better for school age kids. Overall good purchase .
My little one loves this book! Great size for him too. I didn't realize it was a board book till I got it but happy cause its easier for him to hold and not too small that he feels like its &#34;a baby book&#34; which he doesn't like lol .
Got this for my 3 year old son and my 5 year old nephew. It was on sale for 4.50!!! I love them. They were very easy to use perfect size for them and really got there attention! This was my first volcano kit too and I was really into it!!! Its so much fun! Great price and definitely recommend even for older kids Im in my mid twenties and I couldn't wait to use it! Its great for all ages Its not very tall which is sensible since you can't keep them anyway. It was really easy to use and paint! You will need your own vinegar and baking soda and food coloring if you prefer that I just added the red paint into the vinegar for ours. Anyways excellent purchase I recommend this to everyone .
The box is way bigger then expected!! Its huge!!! lol I scored this baby when it was on sale for 12 bucks!!!!!! =)) Got it for my nephew for xmas. Hes autistic so I don't like to buy him gifts just for boys I like to get him something more personal and this is what he wanted! He loves it! Its really a great buy .
Brought it for someone who just moved and doesn't cook often. She says its great! Big set and great price good for those with smaller families (pots aren't huge) Good quality overall but packaging is crappy looks like the box is too small for it but its whats in the box that counts .
it isn't from hp from but it works well. No problems after a month. It is shorter then the original but I dont mind considering the cost difference. It does get a little hot but all chargers do with much use! I would recommend .
xmas gift for my 3 year old who got his first game system a wii! I was very skeptical about it being too hard but I wanted to encourage the physical movement. We live in a crappy area so I don't take him out much unless its far from here. So I wanted something that could get him playing and moving without going to the local parks! Great buy Its really easy for him! He loves all the characters even though hes not into tv he started to like them with this game! Hes really into books so I didn't think he would like this but he really loves it and he plays for about 30 minutes a day with me! (It really is a workout lol) Great for parents and kids to do together .
I purchased this and received it two days later! As always Amazon.com shipping is superior! Ive never had issues with an items sold from amazon.com although I have with their third party sellers. I thought this was a safe bet. I attempted to use it for the first time today and it caught on fire!!! I was using it in a bedroom in a safe outlet that I use for chargers and other items with no issue! It was not around any water! My hair was dry and was using it to help make it straighter. At first it had a smokey smell and I thought maybe this is like a new hair dryer smell. My straightener sometimes smells like this if I use with my hair wet so I thought this was fine. I turned it out waited 5 mins then tried again and luckily I cautiously turned the hair dryer away from hair to make sure it was safe and sure enough fire came out I turned it off unplugged it and it patted it down with a blanket till I stopped. I was sooo scared! luckily I wasn't burned but my blanket had to be tossed! Amazon.com was helpful with processing a return and I still think revlon products are great but something must have been wrong with this particular one so be careful with this .
Definitely recommend this beats the prices in other stores by far and really does protect my ipod from scratches and other marks as it has fallen a few times and it has nothing with this on it .
Okay phone brought it to replace a blackberry! It CANT replace a blackberry! Dumbest replacement ever! Its good for people who dont care to have high end phones. It has email, web, text, phones, picture mail etc... Its okay picture quality is gross -_- seriously no good and messages take a while to send/receive and web is superrrr slow but that cause im used to the blackberry so for others it might not seem so bad. Its okay overall. buy with caution .
brought it for a game. Didn't fit my guy but he has really thick long hair so all his hats need to be bigger but for women and children and men with short hair cuts I recommend this! It is adjustable! Great price and great quality .
Not much to say about this only cause its a small item. Great price does the job no scratches thus far .
Pricey!!! I get fleece blankets at walmart for 2 bucks! But I was buying for the character for a handicapped boy who loves scooby doo he can't play with much so this was a good gift for him! After a few washes the string on the outside comes out but it was washed frequently in a short time so maybe thats why! If your buying for someone who cant use toys its a good buy if they can play with toys I recommend you spent the money on the toys better because the quality isn't the greatest .
Im using it right now to type! Its great. Windows 8 is stupid feels more like im using a phone and Ive caught myself trying to use the screen as a touch lol but overall its nicely built, works well and is really cute. I would recommend for a younger crowd and those who don't want much memory as I have used most of mine in less then a month! But I have alot of songs, apps, movies etc .
Excellent! True to size I'm size 4 I ordered a medium because my hips are wide and my backside isn't small it fits perfectly. The quality is surprisingly great I expected some loose threads but it was perfect! Shipping was fast too. The top part is great because the straps are wide enough for fuller chested women and the bottom is tight but stretchy so it sucks in all the right places! Hope this helped. Don't hesitate to purchase .
bought this so crap does not go into the cracks of the keyboard which it have prevented but it no longer lays perfectly flat...thinking its the heat that has made it this way but still use it everday .
This candy tasted good but is good only if you do not have any side effects from it. I tried it twice and on both occasions, it caused me massive and incapacitating diarrhea. I do not have lactose intolerance nor any other food allergy. No sure what is contained in these candies that caused me massive diarrhea (12-14 watery stools within next 12-14 hours). Were these infected ? Did they have toxin? Not sure if this batch was defective or generally contains harmful substances. I ate these candies around a year back at which time they seemed to be fine. But this time, they caused me lots of trouble. I am sure that these candies caused my symptoms as I tried nothing new nor did I eat out.  Just had these candies on 2 separate occasions 2 days apart. At the first incidence, I couldn't believe that a candy can cause diarrhea to a non allergenic person so ate it again 2 days after and had similar bouts of diarrhea, this time even worse just a couple of hours after having candies.Pretty sure that these caused the diarrhea. Not to mention that I am pretty tolerant to anything and everything in food. Had no food allergies so far. Won't recommend these to anyone .
I could not have imagined how bright a small single battery flashlight could be. The clip makes it very convinient to hang it on your belt for hiking or other places. Go for it .
I was disappointed in this release.I have been a huge Chrissie Hynde fan since the very first Pretenders album.This record is too pop oriented for my taste,The songwriting collaboration between Chrissie and Bjorn Yitling is much weaker than her previous work.There is even a track with whistling on it similar to the Peter Bjorn and John hit &#34;Young Folks&#34;.The 2 stars are for Chissie's great voice.No one in rock 'n' roll can kick your ass or tear your heart out like Ms. Hynde.Please reform The Pretenders .
I write this review one day after learning of the death of Charlie Haden.What a way to go out!This is a brilliant recording.They were done at the same time as their 2010 recording &#34;Jasmine&#34;,but even the alternate takes of two tracks are different and take my breath away.Keith Jarrett's playing has never been better and Mr. Haden's double bass,while subtle at times,never fails to capture the emotions he is trying to express.Their versions of these standards are nothing if not amazingly beautiful.As Mr.Jarrett said in the liner notes to &#34;Jasmine&#34;four years ago-&#34;Call your wife or husband or lover in late at night and sit down and listen&#34;.Buy this recording.You will not be sorry.R.I.P.Charlie .
although they don't fall under army regulations i dont advise you wear them in garrison, but down range who cares. hiking up mountains was so much easier because i wasnt busting my butt everywhere. breathable REALLY breathable feet get cold in the winter. weight was  rediculously light i compared them to the nikes and its a really close call. overall for a down range boot A .
comfortable. the finger loop doesn't kill my thumb good support for me my only concern was some times i like the wraps a little tighter and with the velcro you can only tighten it down so far. overall i give them a A- .
I had to wait one month to get this product and when I installed it to my Droid, which I have done times before when I cracked my screen, it wouldn't work.  Come to find out it didn't come with the digitizer.  Don't waste your time with this product.....no digitizer .
I just started it a now u want me to review. Needs to be done later. Don't know yet. Thanks .
These headlight are real nice was skeptic about ordering them but glad i did they light up nice and clear only bad is the delivery on trac must of been tossing the box around cause the case was broken and caved in glad the bulbs weren't easy to install also would recommend .
This collection of six horror stories is entertaining. Turkish Night is a surreal and violent story about belly dancing competitors. Never Leave Me stars a possessive husband and a ghost, with an interesting twist to the ending that I really liked. In The Painted Staircase, a troublemaker on a museum tour gets more than he bargains for. The Colour of Dishonor is a chillingly different kind of historical horror story with a cruelly dishonorable character who finds himself haunted by his sins. I Dived the Pandora is a scary story about a wreck dive gone terribly wrong. Enjoyable collection .
This is an excellent, well written set of horror stories. The first two are like dark fairy tales. With This Ring has little mazes as illustrations of key plot points. The third story takes a psychological turn. In Losing Dan the question of 'I wonder what they were thinking just before that unthinkable act' is answered. I almost wish it was left unanswered, I had such a strong visceral reaction to this story. The fourth story is about a woman who moves into a literally distressed property. I particularly like the ending. Special mention has to go to the last story in the collection, Flood of Darkness. If the best part of Losing Dan was getting into someone's mind then it is fitting that the final story not only delves into the mind of its troubled narrator but also provides a suspenseful story about a natural disaster. Things get very intense before the completely satisfying end. I'll be looking for more by this author .
I liked how the layout of the pouches were. They held all my tools that I need. I hate making many trips to the truck so I carry everything in my pouches so that part was great. Also, the suspenders didn't hinder my overhead reach much compared to other suspenders that I've tried. Being an electrician I often do work off ladders, having arm movement is a must so that was nice.  The biggest problem I had was that I wore the belt a week and it started fraying around the metal gromits. At first I just took a lighter and melted the nylon but it soon became too much of a problem for being a new belt .
Glad I bought this. didn't had enough money to spend so decided to go with this coat. its good coat .
ONe of my fev. i been having for couple of months and it works great. I been shooting outside in the wind but never had problem with this .
go for it with out even thinking. I been had this for last 1 year. I bought many different headphone but they don't last it for long because of GYm workout. this is a similar to skull candy $12 headphone. this is cheaper and last longer. go for it you wont go wrong .
don't buy any expensive triggers!!! just get this one. works perfectly fine. has good coverage. no problem at all. buy it ! stop reading more reviews. ! :P .
stop thinking about what to get for your Ipad 2,3rd gen or 4th. go with this product, u won't go wrong. perfect fits for my ipad 3. shipping was fast took 3 days only .
Pieces  fit well and seem thicker.  Picture is somewhat intricate and fun and not too difficult.  Color scheme is very good .
I love it! I have to keep buying replacements because my friends and family keeping taking mine! Can't beat the price .
Great dog house, but they didn't send the wing nuts for the clean plastic doors.. But other then that Great .
The item I received was a genuine Netgear unit as seen in the images with the same length cord as the original.  Works great, no more buzz .
It's suitable for my arm,not too tight or losse.Fit for Medium arm i guess. It just okey for the price .
First my order got lost in transit. I realize that's not amazons fault but still frustrating. Then when I finally got them, only 2 of the 5 pieces were intact with no replacement available .
Very cute and wears nice. Not sure how I'll wash it though.  I'm concerned the fringe will hold up in the wash .
It requires adobe air an when you try to download it to the kindle it is unsupported. You can't use the app .
I often find that authors of such manuals try to fit the square peg of their own experience as SF or SWAT into the round hole of operations of civilian self defenders during WROL, TEOTWAWKI etcThis often results  poorly adapted drills, comments, judgments.But none of such errors in judgement can be found in Max's book.Everything he writes makes logical and operational sense and is adapted for the situations he writes about.I am convinced that as his book "Contact" slowly percolates thru the community it will achieve cult status within a decade or two, as THE basic manual that fits the "civilian caught in SHTF" PoU.There is nothing else like it out there and IMO it's a future classic .
Patriot Dawn: It's fantastic for what it is.A novelization of Max's tactical manuals especially CONTACT and (I suspect since i have not read it yet) "Rapid Fire".I can tell some people where  a bit unenthused about the plot being a little thin. In my mind that's ok,. don't expect a Tom Clancyuesque yarn but something more valuable instead:A Tactical Manual written as a novel.  Everything he writes is in order to illustrate a tactical lesson he wants to teach.And he has  a lot to teach!I think this may be the best way to learn for many folks who simply can't get themselves to pick up a manual.Even though Max's manuals are not nearly as dry as most, I think this novelization approach may work quite well for many.Sometimes a plot element may seen a little contrived, just keep in mind what it's purpose is. If you want intricate plot twists, well developed characters and brilliant timeless dialogue, look elsewhere.If you want to learn while you read, this is the place.The book is best read using a pen and paper and drawing out the tactical situations as they occur in the book.A Map of Virginia to follow along is also helpful and aids in understanding.Be advised at the end of the book is a index of acronyms common in Combat arms.. check it out before you read.I hope everyone enjoys the book!PS: The plot thickens near the end  and there is a cliffhanger, can't wait until the next book .
This is a cute movie, sad that people burn each other people like that though in that profession. all in all thought, we love Zac Efron and can't see him doing a bad movie .
The skeins were smaller than the ones I purchase in the stores which took me by surprise. I had trouble finding this particular color scheme in stores around town so I went on line. I need it for the border on a blanket. I'm glad I purchased two but noe I'm thinkging it's may not be enough .
Good stories, like these are the kind you don't mind your kid watching. no cursing, viloence etc (there's enough of that in the real world .
This poster is a good one but not really what I was looking for. The blue car didn't fit the color scheme of the room and the dark sky gives a gloomy depressed feeling. We are focusing on the "Paris Theme" in my granddaughter's room and want to make it a fun room. She is a pre-teen and didn't care for the public display of affection .
My granddaughter choose the &#34;Paris Theme&#34; for her bedroom. she likes the modern look more than the &#34;old fashioned&#34; as she called it.I have to steer away from &#34;to much Eiffel Tower&#34; as she wants more variety than just that. Amazon has a better variety than say Hobby Lobby which tends to cater to a younger girls, you know pink, sparkly...that sort of thing is just not Destiny anymore .
I love the rubber, easy to keep a good grip on it. Nice design for those that doesn't want too much bling .
I don't know where they manufacture this dress, but even when the size says Large, it's way to small for western ladies .
I received a totally different top from the design that what was promised, it's not even close to what is shown. I wouldn't recommend this item, please don't waste your time and money .
I wasn't certain this book could touch my soul and move me as much as the Kite Runner, but my doubts were completely unfounded.  Khalid Hosseini once again weaves a tale of love, sacrifice, human endurance in a land completely foreign to me but somehow brought to life with words that placed me right in the heart of the story.  I couldn't put the book down. Thank you Mr. Hosseini for painting such a vivid picture .
Very slim and has a nice grip. It looks like you don't even have a case on it really though .
Good story line  excellent characters.  Couldn't put The book down held my interest almost like I was apart of the story .
DOOM 3 BFG edition is a great game and a classic in my opinion. I can't say how Doom 3 was but I can say that DOOM 3 BFG EDITION is EPIC. It is a game worth buying and the plot is great. I would recommend buying this game as I think that it is worth your money .
i would recommend this book as well as all of Vanessa's books to all. she never lets you down in her books that is whay i raterd this a 5 star .
i don't know  what else to say about  these  book  i love them therefore  a must read for  everyone . can't get enough .
I have Read just about Everything that Lutisha has written and she did not let me down in this book at all .
After waiting so long for  this book to come it was not what I expected not sure what i was looking for .
I have Read Many Book by Kiki  and this was not her Best .This is the type of book you read if you have nothing else to read .
I have this a five and would recommend this series as a good read .i don't believe that this is the end of the twins and another book is coming .
this is  a book that will hold you interest gave me a lot of insight  to the street life can't wait to  get the next book .
The boots look sturdy enough, altough i have to try them in the field, maybe i will go hunting this weekend.They are also pretty comfortable, i just walked a couple miles today with them and i have no sore feet. Also they arrived sooner than i thought, thats a big plus .
I love this item, this is what I expected~!!!there's no regret to order this phone case:)it looks great with black iphone .
broke the first day do not buy!!!!!! took two weeks to get then broke immediatley............don't buy this item is terrible .
pretty easy to install, and when the door closes it isn't that loud at all.my cat hated the magnet part and wouldn't come through the cat door until i spent 20 minutes tearing the plastic and magnet off of the thing .
this cleans very well and pretty fast. it has a nice citrus scent and i like the fact that it is all natural. i just wish it wasn't so expensive .
i like them but there are two major downfalls..i'm 5'4" and 125-130lbs. downfall one- these socks were so tight on my thighs i felt like my legs were sausage links.downfall two- these socks are wayyyy long!definitely not for petite girls .
i love this. great neutral tones. only downside is that some of the colors don't blend as well as the others .
i was so excited to try this...it ended up to be a let down.the suedeberry is much more orange-y than it looks.yes it applies like a gloss and dries very matte... so matte that it was actually flaking off my lips, but it wouldn't stay anywhere near the middle/inner parts of my lips.removing this was not exactly easy either .
I like the watch, but it was missing a stone on the wrist band. Didn't feel like goin through the time to get a new one .
It's fun and entertaining for not only me but my friends.. but you could work on it and make th bird a lil faster .
This app is the best app I have! It shows you what keys to play.You could search your favorite songs and play them. It is also fun and entertaining. If you don't want to play it you could just listen to it. I enjoy this app solo much!!!!!!:-) :- .
This item took twice as long to arrive as any other purchase I've ever made from Amazon.  This glove provided little of the warmth I was looking for during my time on the sidelines coaching football.  Ended up having to buy a different Under Armour glove from the local sporting goods store, higher quality cold gear at a cheaper price.  This is the first negative experience I've had, hopefully there won't be any others .
This is the second time buying off of Amazon.  Not the greatest so far.  I ordered these protector covers for my galaxy S2 per the picture, description, and customer comments and reviews of this seller.  I got these in an envelope not in any kind of packaging.  Immediately I saw they were not the right ones.  They are not what the picture looks like.  The pic has 2 cutouts at the top for the camera and the sound and this has one long cutout for both.  Plus these are way too small.  They don't cover the whole screen at all.  I have set up a return hoping they will send me the right ones.  I really don't care about the refund I just want the right covers.  I will mail back tomorrow and follow up with a post of what happened.  Had to pay my own postage for return also.  Pretty cheap for their error .
Got this case for my Straight Talk Samsung Galaxy S2.  The looks alright but around some of the edges the sticker print is peeling right out of the package.  Real fast delivery.  The pen is pretty cool.  The screen protector is nice but they should have reversed the way you put it on because I would think you would want to match up the cut-outs first when you stick it on for the first time.  The top corner of the snap together doesn't stay snapped all the time sometimes it pops apart.  Overall the phone fits in perfect and it will save it from some damage for awhile.  Don't know if the case will stay together though if dropped.  I'm going to order an otterbox right after this review .
i lead a group of 80 year olds who are interested in end times prophecy... lifeguide bible studies always offer in depth studyand this one &#34;end times&#34; did not disappoint .
So having read the book, I too was at first confused on a lack of stuff from the book. However for anyone who read it, that movie would have had to been a lot longer to include it all! When you realize that, they included a lot of good stuff!! I really enjoyed Chase Williamson as David! I think he got it perfect, and the Dave/John dynamic was excellent!!! I will not include any spoilers, however I will say to anyone who has not read the book, you will more than likely not have any clue what the hell is going on, so just watch it for entertainment!!!I really hope this movie does well enough for the sequel, because TBIFOS is definitely movie worthy .
Long ago I bought the XP version of this book.As it saved me a fortune I bought the Vista version for use with my wifes new  Vista laptop. I personally am staying with XP. Since the demise of system hand books there is a need for books that give clear &#34;how to do it&#34; instructions and examples and this series is well above average in this respect. This book is not only for the aged and wrinkled but anyone that has been lumbered with this computer operating system .
THIS IS MY SECOND TIME ORDERING THIS BATTERY, DONT OVER CHARGE IT BECAUSE IT WILL EXPLODE, BUT IT WILL LAST YOU FOR A COUPLE MONTHS .
I loved this book. Can't wait to read the next one. I couldn't put this book down. A great read .
Very powerful, excellent, couldn't put it down.  Very thought provoking and entertaining.  I would recommend it to everyone who reads .
Great game. Have to have great memory of places.  There is some tough logos some you have to go to places where you haven't seen or heard before .
It's kinda like call of duty.  Don't deny this game is money well spent.  It's like one of those games you never what to put done .
Reading this book made me kinda feel like tesla himself. Kinda innocent child who absolutely loved what he did. The fact the Tesla's work is not emphysized in modern educational systems worries me..READ IT .
I got it and the screen broke don't have long .
this product did not work at all!!!! i was very disappointed. threw them away. a waste of my money!! I should of asked for a refund .
It was described well, just a shown. I love it! BUT, the ball is very hard to unscrew to be able to put in. Still can't get it un screwed .
I really did not need this. My purse had a compartment for acer notebook chrome c7 and did not know this until I order this .
This is a good product.  I did not need it after all. So I'm returning it to the sender and that's all I have to say .
Good product I order this by mistake.  It does not fit acer chrome notebook c710 series.  It's 3&#34; longer and there was no way  to make it .
I just didn't care for it to much going on .Thank you to much shooting to much blood wasn't that great .
I bought this wig on a different site and was just amazed at how ugly it was. there was pieces of hair sticking out, the bows were poorly put on and you can see the cap! not to mention it was shipped in a flat bag which was crammed in my tiny little mailbox! I would not recommend this wig to anyone .
Overall amazing product. Took a few extra days to get here. Looks great and the cover went on easy! only thing that was a problem was that the sticker on the screen protector would not come on off so i have glue smear on my screen .
No complaints whatsoever. Very clear, people say they can hear me perfectly, even better than through the regular cordless phone. Volume adjustment, mute button .
This Pyrex 2-Cup Measuring Cup should be a part of standard kitchen equipment in every household - it simply cannot be beat .
This coaster set is not only very attractive to look at on my coffee table, but the coaster holder is the cat's meow.  Great set .
Not only is this an unusual cookie jar, it is very well made and attractive to look at.  My only problem is I cannot keep it full of cookies .
KitchenAid products simply cannot be beat!  These measuring cups serve their purpose very well, and are very sturdy to boot .
KitchenAid simply cannot be beat.  For the common ol' egg slicer, this one is tops, and it looks great too .
KitchenAid just cannot be beat - this ice cream scoop works well for the large, deep containers and is very sturdy and heavy duty .
These small soaps look like they really came from the seashore.  They are so attractive in my soap dish, that I hope no one ever uses them .
Great recipes and mental aromas.  Makes you feel like you are in the middle Iran,  Can't wait for the next dinning experience .
Some of the best recipes for tasting the street food of India.  Hot, spicy and just down right good.  An easier read for those home cooks that cannot follow recipes without pictures .
This book draws you in from the beginning. I love that not only do you get one side but both .
This game is just incredible, and a must-have for SMT fans. It's a turn-based strategy JRPG, and a good one at that. The atmosphere is just the right amount of creepy and incredibly intriguing. Played the persona games but not sure if you'll like the other SMT stuff? Give this a shot, you won't be disappointed C .
If you're like me and happen to run out of space with only about 4 games left sitting on your shelf, this card is a great choice. It might not have a ton of space like other cards here on Amazon, but it's officially-licensed and it works perfectly. No problems, and fast delivery. If you need a little more space for your game collection, you can't go wrong with this .
Unfortunately, this didn't solve my PC issue like I'm sure it would, but I did eventually get to try them out and they work great! Were shipped in careful packaging and arrived on-time. A good product if you've got an older machine like me and need something with a little more power .
Very cute charm necklace set, picked it up for me and my sis. I felt a bit worried after reading the reviews that the chain itself was a bit flimsy, but as long as you're not running a marathon or doing construction work in it, it should be fine. Even then, I still recommend getting a new chain for it, just in case. The charms themselves are high-quality and very pretty! My sister loves hers and I've been wearing mine everywhere. Product also arrived much earlier than expected, thanks! If you're a Miku fan who likes things like this, or even just someone looking for a cute set of necklaces, I'd recommend .
It came bent straight out of the packaging. It might have been just mine but I'm never buying the product again .
it broken and dirty!!!!!! I don't want to say anything, i think it is awake. ......... i don't like it .
MMy son loved the costume of Robin the stores didn't have his size they said they didn't want to order it any more because they were making Robin a girl .
I love this item. I'm still working on it. It is not a simple design, not for the beginner. You must have patience as it takes awhile to do. I think once I'm done and have it framed it will be an heirloom with our 10 grandchildren's names on it .
I thought I was buying a set of pillow cases as the information was not clear on that when I ordered.  Instead there was only one pillow case ---- very expensive for one pillow case.  however the picture was clear and my twilight saga loving daughter was screaming with delight when she received it .
Did not like this game good thing it was a free game I would have been upset if I spent money on it .
I like playing this game but they don't give you many tokens to play with and the tournaments take 3 tokens .
I bought this item awhile back and never got to use it because it was untuneable and the strings it comes with were the wrong kind for this type of guitar and when I took it in to get new strings they told me that the bridge was about to snap because of the tension from the strings it comes with. Also the pitch pipe is a piece of plastic trash. I could literally use nothing in this order.I will never buy any other product from this seller, because they lied to us all to get a sale and all we receive is garbage. So don't waste your money here .
Good book.  I would recommend it to friends.  Enjoy the case studies.  Haven't finished reading it yet.  Thank you very much .
This is a daily read in my house. A nugget of information from this book will give you all the inspiration you need to fuel your daily dive. This book is a must have for your library and if you don't have a library, start one; buy this book .
This item does NOT work. It should be a standard Micro USB charger but for some reason won't charge my phone .
I received my case and keyboard cover. I was looking for a deal on both together, and I thought this looked like a good product. Be aware, the case is not crystal clear. There is a frost like quality or opacity to it. The keyboard cover is silver, not clear. However, I do like the silver keyboard, because it blends in nicely with the aluminum of the computer, and gives it a retro feel. Typing will take a bit of getting used to, but it is a good fit. The case fits nice as well, I just wish it was a little more see through. Another note on the keyboard cover- the power button key is painted with the eject symbol, leading me to believe that its for the Macbook Pro, but, again, to me its not a deal breaker. I am very happy with my purchase, and saved a good amount of money over buying a case and keyboard cover in a store .
Please don't make the mistake I did and buy these thinking that you are getting a good deal...you are NOT. I have never had a problem with dual layer dvd+r disks before, so I also made the mistake of not reading any reviews.I bought the 50 disk spindle (DR8S8B50F/17). So far I have burned through 23 disks with 4 successful writes using DL.These disks have a problem when trying to write to the second layer as they all error at 50%; they will not continue to write. Burning a file a single layer size results in 100% success (I have done this on about 10 disks so far). So instead of a good deal on dl disks, these are rather expensive single layer dvd + r disks.Other info:I use ImgBurn (always have, always will). I have used dl media from Sony, Memorex, and mostly Verbatim with absolutely no errors (unless it was something I caused). I only bought the Philips because they were on sale and I'm always willing to try out new alternatives.I have tried on 3 seperate burners (Sony, LG, Pioneer)...same result (from 4x-8x)I am not going to accept the 'this is a bad batch' nonsense as there should be some sort of QC in place to prevent that.Ultimately, this product is a waste of money. I will never buy anything with the Philips brand again. As has been said time and time again you are better off buying the more (slightly more) expensive disks .
He is always ready for adventure no matter where it takes him.  Protecting his people--be they two-legged or four -is his aim .
Enough said--the blurb was better than the book!  The whole thing was not worth what I paid for it.  Very boring .
Although I have not seen this movie, I can tell you the original songs on this soundtrack are positively amazing. The Christmas songs will be a nice addition to my Christmas musical collection with the rest of the soundtrack taking up permanent residence on my Ipod. Don't miss out on this diamond in the rough, give it a try and be as pleasantly surprised as I was .
Action packed adventure takes you to the Louisana swamps... Mexican  cartels, Santeria sacrifices are part of this can't put story.  Great read .
This book is hard to put down.  I haven't quite finished it, but my Kindle is recharging.  It has a great plot, lots of action, a great story line.  It is everything you look for when selecting your next book .
The pages flew by in this page turner.  Jack stumbles onto a Big case that involves child kidnapping.  It leads to nowhere you would have thought.  Great plot, excellent characters, and moving situations .
From the moment you open the cover, you cannot put it down.  An intriguing, convoluted tale of horrors beyond imagination.  Not for the weak of heart.  This story takes you on a ride fraught with twists, turns and terror .
A top investigator comes to Ireland to start training newbies to become CSI.  On her first investigation, she finds signs that several crimes have been perpetrated by a sadistic and brutal serial killer and linked them together.  Of course, the police chief doesn't agree with her methods.  This book was a fast read, with a big twist, good plot and great characterisations .
This adapter works great.  I'm plugged in when not reading... and when I read for longer periods.  Its price was the lowest of the adapters .
What we were looking for were the extension lines with microphone in each unit so everyone can hear when a call comes in.  This unit works great.  Now we have no problem getting to the phone, and don't have to run through the house to answer incoming calls.  Our main telephone line stopped working, and the only working line was in the office... on the other side of the house .
I couldn't put this book down.  It's well written, a good plot, with turns and twists to keep you reading.  I highly recommend this book .
The price is less than the local retailer's. I have extra filters for future projects. A few times they popped off of the mask without my knowing, but I may not have secured them properly. They worked for my purpose .
I would recommend this book to all senior tablet users, we aren't as savvy as the younger generation. Great buy .
Dyson is one brand you can count on, but, you can't buy their filters anywhere but on line. The vacuum is great, this site is fantastic! But DYSON should make their products filters easier to purchase .
It's the same size as note 10.1 2014, but the home button cut out is in the wrong place & to small. When called for replacement or refund. Found out the number was no longer in service. Very unhappy .
The color cartridge works fine but none of the FOUR black ink cartridges functions. I want to have my problem resolved .
The color cartridge works fine as expected. It was easy to install. However the black cartridge does not produce any ink .
I was sent a DVD that doesn't work in my DVD player it says wrong region. I want to know why they think this is acceptable. Now I'm stuck with a movie I can't watch .
Simple, but effective. This app lets you track your progress, and lets you start at a level that is right for you, if you don't cheat on the initial assessment. Great app .
The lanterns arrive solar charged,ready to use. Radio and light work as expected.They will not be used in the US but in Haiti.I'll know more about them in a few months .
This movie was boring to me I could not watch pass the first 10 minutes of it The movie was not for me .
This product is a little flimsy but it's okay it does the job And at that price you really can't beat it .
It's a nice charger it does the job charges my Samsung galaxy S With no problem It's great for the price .
This Product arrived broken With eyeshadow everywhere Packaging was poor nothing to protect it colors are hard to see and I had a hard time picking up the product on my brush Are you several different kinds of brushes and none of them picked up the product The product was smaller than I actually thought next time I will just get the one from Sephora .
I bought this thermogenic for the Energy and focus throughout the day and it did exactly that! Not only that, it also helped suppress my appetite. I have a high tolerance for most pre workouts and fat burners but this product still gave me want I want for energy .
This product is great!!!Well worth the price spent! Will recommend this product to anyone, whether it be any individual doing their own nails at home, or professionally!!Very easy to use, and very convenient. Not to mention it is very wide, fits both hands or both feet well at the same time!!Clear buttons to specify how long the light and/or fan stay on as well!!A++++ ITEM .
I WAS NOT THE LEAST BIT HAPPY WITH THIS "BOOK"REVIEW OF THE MOVIE...WHAT I WANTED WAS THE DVD MOVIE...NOT SOMETHING I'D HAVE TO READ.  I WAS GOING TO RETURN IT, BUT NO LONGER HAD THE ORIGINAL PACKAGING AND I HAD ALREADY OPENED IT , WO WATCH...NOT READ. (SO, I FIGURED I AM STUCK WITH IT, WHETHER I LIKE IT OR NOT .
Well, I wasn't expecting something very fancy. Otherwise, the material is really poor, very slim and probably will be deteriorated soon .
It's very convenient. No need to go to the store for the results. It's like a one shop store for all your needs .
Very good book! I loved it! I could not put this book down for anything. Best book I've read in awhile .
This is perfect for me.  I don't have the strength to pull a cord.  This is easy to handle and does a great job on the small yard I have.  The battery charge usually lasts me three cuttings.  Awesome .
When I search strings like "statement command" it finds the phrase(4 cases exactly). However, the highlighted phrases are a few word off-focused. That is, in the following text snippet,'The Show Next Statement commmand...'"Show Next" is high-lighted instead "Statement command". In this case, two words are off-focused.Additionally, quite a few graphic titles like "Run to cursor", "Step Over" are hard to recognize.Lastly, I felt a couple of pages are missing although I don't remember exactly where they are.As a overall judgement, I don't regret buying this book. I'm reading this book on my Android smart-phone, too.Take care .
As I expected it did not cover every details of the so called perfect language C#.Still I can learn basic idea of the language and English grammer too.I'm not a native English speaker that is why I learn English thru' computer language English book.Maybe this book is for me since I'm a dummy .
execute all the source code in the book.Some package needed to be installed and it wasn't explained in the book in detail .
Within 2 months(on Feb 9th), it's broken now. An after service center in Seoul(ROK) said. I need to bring it to the country(The US) where I bought it. Isn't this product a laptop which is easy to move around the world? I bought this product not only because it's cheap but also it's a product of HP which has a wide area of service chain world-wide. So, I don't understand why I have to bring the product myself to get service for a SSD malfunction?I don't recommend this product now.I bought it since it has SSD inside which is more vibration resistant and fast in multi processing stage.As a matter of fact, I was at a loss when it did not boot at first.However, I found out that I need to separate the battery and put it back again to make this laptop boot for the first time.Now it is working as normal. I'm writing this message using the laptop and over all judgement on this machine is that it is working as I expected. However, I don't know why it is this heavy. In fact, it is as heavy as the one with HDD on it or heavier than that.Still it boots fast cause it has SSD in it. Beside the speed, consider the price $400 something is super cheap at its performance isn't it .
This guitar sucks. It really does. Buy it if you want too. I don't have it, but the price and looks give it to you .
This guitar isn't the best in the world but ok for beginners. It kind of sucks. But buy it if you want .
Sort of like the new monopoly for us! We really love it. There are different versions out there, with easier board set up but they get a little expensive and I didn't think it was worth it.  I'm very happy about my decision .
It is NOT a beanbag like it said in the title. But I don't mind. And it's face was kind of naturally mad; so I spent some time trimming the facial hair to fix it's expression .
I didn't love it but it was easy to ready and usually very interesting.  The writer has  flare for writing .
Loved the movie and thought the book would be good too I was wrong though it added to the movie the subplots were not needed and the author got lost at times frst the main character has boots then she magically doesn't then she does was a bit annoying .
Pretty colors and comfortable. Sizes are accurate. Launders very nicely; No stretching or twisting. Keeps its shape well. I will purchase these again .
My favorite wall calendar for the past 6 years!  A travelogue of places to see with amazing photography.  The information displayed for each month will not only educate you but entice you to visit that part of the world someday .
This classic movie will never get old.  It's still as fun and scary as the day Disney first released the movie.  The animation and story telling are top-notch .
Gold Toe makes the best socks - they fit well and last a long time.  I never buy anything else .
I've tried many lip balms and moisturizers and this is one of the best.  It stays on your lips and doesn't wear off like others do .
For the money, this deal couldn't be beat. When I'm ready for some more speakers. I'll be sure to shop here .
100% well made, perfect condition, no issues.  The only thing that could have made it better was to put $20 in it.  I did .
When I first started reading this book I didn't think I would fall in love with it but the more I read the more I couldn't resist putting it down .
I love this book and can remember it like I just read it the love in this book shows me true love is real and not forgotten .
I was very satisfied with this product. The shipment came on time as expected, and no flaws in the product. I installed them in my 2002 Saturn sl2 (four door). It definitely improved the look of my car and the feel of it as well. It took about an hour to fit.pros-takes little time to look professional-about 45 minutes in my car-looks and feels awesome and fits snugly-leather is durable and stretches into seat-cheap and affordableconsnone really, back were kind of hard to figure out but looked nice afterwardsOverall, if you are looking for a good priced product, these seat covers will not let you down .
Very good protection but the rubber on the back side doesn't fit tight as it should. May have to exchange it for another one .
I read the book &#34;Boots on the ground&#34; and when I saw this book I just had to get it! I bought it and I loved it. I am not a reader at all. I only read the other book because I had to for school. But I finished this book in less than 2 weeks. It is an outstanding book .
I didn't need the entire book, but what I did need was perfect. Helped me learn some short cuts on my TI-83. Good book .
I bought this flavor to try it. It is alright, however it is defiantly not the best flavor ever. The protein does its job, but I wish I had gotten chocolate flavor .
I received this watch as a Christmas gift and have had it for 3 months now. If I had seen it in the store, I probably wouldn't have bought it for myself, but since now I actually have one.. I really like it and I would regret not buying it for myself. It seems very sturdy and it has all the features I like in a watch. It even has a pretty loud and annoying alarm, although I never use it .
These did there job but they also leaked when you took them out of the printer. I wouldn't exactly recommend these if your not on a budget .
These rose petals could not have been a better price. They don't look 100% real, but they also don't look super cheap like some of the others I have looked into. If you are on a budget, then get these. they were perfect for my occasion. The best part is when your done you can reuse them and they do not stain like real petals would .
This is a great product for such a low price. At first I was a little skeptical about getting it because usually you get what you pay for. I have not ran with this on yet, but it seems to be durable. It it made out of the same/or similar material that those little beer can holders are made of. When I opened the bag, I saw how big this case was and immediately was like "Well that was a waste of money, this is way to big!" I have the Incredible Droid 4G LTE (a smaller touch screen phone compared to others) but because this case is big it fits my phone with its case on perfectly! So this is a great product and allows me to use it without having to take my phone case off! Although when I take my case off of my phone and put it in the arm band case it is obvious the arm band case is to big, but that's fine because I rarely take my normal phone case off anyway. I recommend! Oh and it arrived two days before it said it would .
This is the second time I have ordered screen protectors from this company. Both times I got super fast shipping. I was not supposed to get my product for another two days, but I got it early both times.Now time to review this particular screen protector, It seems like good quality, However, It does not grant as much privacy as a similar tech armor screen protector. Downfall for this screen protector is that it isn't as private as the tech armor one. Good thing though, is you get 3 screen protectors for around $5. But the Tech armor privacy screen protector was $8 for a pack of one!I would have given 5 stars, but it just isnt as private as other ones .
This is my first one star rating. I didn't buy the game, but I rented it from redbox first to see how I likes it before I spent $30. I'm glad I only paid $2 because this game is no fun at all. I did not like anything in this game .
I ordered this thinking for nearly $8 it was a three pack. It wasn't until after it shipped that I realized I had just paid $8 for ONE screen protector. I just received it and it seems to be pretty good quality, but I won't know until I put it on my girlfriends phone. I only gave it two stars because it was poorly labeled and I have hopes that it will be a good screen protector .
This was literally the fastest none amazon prime shipping I have ever encountered. I ordered it on a Sunday night, it shipped on Monday and I got it today (Wednesday). As far as the product it was also the easiest screen protector I have ever put on before. I have never been able to get a screen protector on without air bubbles before. The only thing I do not like about this product is because it is matte, it has a pixel look when it is on the phone. On top of the pixel look it also has a little bit of a rougher feeling to it. But besides those two little points I can get over, this is the perfect screen protector .
My incredible 4g LTE phone was not charging for some reason so I bought this so I could just change out the batteries when it got low. after about 3 months one of these generic batteries stopped holding a charge, but between the battery that came with my phone and the extra one I have from this it is fine. I have had it for just short of a year now, and it still works as good as it did the day I got it .
I had orginally bought a very similair Gerry jacket at sports authority, but a week later the zipper broke off. I bought it knowing the zipper had problems, but I didn't think it was going to break like it did. So I returned it and bought this one on amazon. It is nearly identical to my orgibal one. It keeps me super warm and keeps the wind out. I also really like the fact you can zip the other jacket into the bigger jacket. The only down fall on this jacket is the Velcro straps on the sleeves. The Velcro works but they made the strap out of flexable plastic so if you made the sleeves as tight as you could you have like half of the strap hanging out.. but other than that it is great and I love it .
Does a good job but motor is not quite as powerful as I had hoped for. If you press very hard you can stop it. Otherwise a great product .
Recommmend you purchase the extras as they are great value. Don't know how long the originals will last but it's always good to have spares on hand .
Unfortunately I didn't see this movie till just a month ago, I'm can't I hadn't seen it earlier!  The one liners in this movie are masterful, and Karl Urban's portrayal of Dredd was spot on.  Perfect constant scowl .
Received the watch on time. Packed perfectly. Absolutely stunning watch and I have owned everything from Rolex to Breitling. Hamilton delivered on this pilot watch. The case, movement and dial are excellent. The band was a tad short (I have 8 1/4" wrist so that's why). Common problem for me. Anyone with a 7 1/2 wrist the band length will be perfect. Don't hesitate to buy this watch. I was looking at IWC, Ball and this was the perfect choice. I went to our local mall and tried them all on and this watch looks more expensive and has more presence than either of the other two I was considering. This was a decision on style and not driven by finances. I am so thrilled I picked the Hamilton .
I have been reading reviews,  visited Best Buy,  Verizon,  AT&T,  and few other local stores that sell bluetooth speakers. I have purchased 2 other brands and returned them for poor performance. With all that said... I went to best buy this morning to buy either the bose min or Sony srx5.  I realized to get any reasonable sound quality I had to bump to the $200 price point. While looking a very helpful store attendant asked if I needed help. I noticed these TDK not on their shelf to listen to. I asked if he could open the box for me to just see the size.  He opened the box and the second I held the unit I immediately noticed it's weight (heavy enough to have good components but not to heavy to remain portable).  He then asked if I wanted to hear it.  I took him up on that offer.  Meanwhile the was another customer he had been helping choosing between the Logitech or bose unit.  The store person asked what I liked to listen to and I said journey.  He immediately synced his phone and started a journey track.  I was blown away instantly.  The clarity of the sound,  crystal clear highs and amazing base was shocking to say the least.  I knew I had just picked my speaker.  To my amazement the other shopper ready to buy the bose said "holy cow".  My reaction also to this speakers incredibly clear and rich sound.  I grabbed the last one unopened and the other shopper said pack that one back up... I am taking it.  So... Two people bought what I consider a sleepy secret in this overcrowded market of speakers. If you have never listened to this speaker and are looking to purchase any speaker from 150-200 range you absolutely owe it to your ears to find one and hear for yourself. You may just be amazed like I was. After all the looking and reviewing I had done I honestly thought that bose or Sony has the best sound.  I was so wrong.  It had a great speaker phone mic.  It has amazing battery life and you simply can't go wrong. I bought mine for 149.99 and would have paid 200 for it without hesitation.  Buy and enjoy .
I ordered this for somebody as a Christmas present... needless to say they cried from happiness when they opened it. I am not a Dr. Who fan myself but she is an avid fan, so even though she doesn't play guitar she still loved the present. Also the gift came almost 2 weeks earlier than it said that it would which was nice because it was here for our Christmas exchange .
i ordered with my new guitar. These straps are quite flexible length-wise, so if you have ever been disappointed by a strap that you either couldn't get short enough for a high playing position or long enough for a low playing position, you will not be disappointed here .
I bought this cable, because my guitar connection is in the back. This Just fix perfectly! I don't expected nothing better, this is just right. Glad I chose to purchase this cable .
I'm a new user, but seem to be a Great product!!!! Can't complaint!!! I finally got it and saw how great it is. It has plenty of roomy pockets, great padding, and is put together with great quality .
My best buy ever! Don't have to pay for gas. deliveried to you office directly, $2 saving for coffe and my Cannon Love it .
Work perfectly with my guitar, good price. No problems with static, crackling, hum or other sound artifacts. Great for amateur vocal recording like me .
I like this product.  The taste is good.  I have not had my cholesterol checked since I started using it so I can't say if it has improved my numbers yet .
Steam is having problems with this game and its not letting me play- I would check to make sure they have fixed it before purchasing.BUTThis is still an great game I used to play it all the time but I lost my disc copy .
It really does everything that it is supposed to do but the hook will not close for me. I have had everyone I know try to get it to lock together but it is about 1/2&#34; out of place. Other than that inconvenience I have really loved the curlers.Oh yeah, they are not comfortable to sleep on so use a hooded dryer or make this a day project because it was one of the worst nights' sleep I have ever had .
This is a nice start to a new series.  I am looking forward to the next installment!My only complaint would be the same as other &#34;1st&#34; books in series, lots of background to set the stage for the series.  Though I guess I would complain if there wasn't enough!  Good read .
I don't mark many books as 5 stars, that said, this is definitely a 5 star series!  After reading this I went back begging for more!  Can NOT wait for more .
The book was okay.  Not one of my favorites but didn't hate it.  The story was getting very tired and I couldn't wait until it was over.  I normally have to make myself slow down and savor a book or become mad that it is over .
Love the characters.  Not a book to lend the kiddies!  Good story line and good job at keeping the story interesting..was sad that it ended .
When I started this series, I wasn't so sure I would finish it.  A little slow at the start but takes off quickly.  Very interesting plot development, characters are complex and lovable.  I found myself searching for more by this author.  Definitely worth the price.  If you enjoy the zombie genre you will thoroughly enjoy each of these books .
Nice collection of shorter stories.  Normally I do not like &#34;shorts&#34;, but do admit this is definitely worth reading.  Fast paced .
I have to admit, if I wasn't such a patriot/conservative and very concerned about the path of our country, I wouldn't have continued reading this &#34;roughly&#34; written book.  That being said:  if you can get past the bad editing, I feel you do infact have a pretty accurate picture of what the USA will/could be if we don't reign in our current president.I would suggest reading this book to friends but let them know that leeway must be given due to poor/no editing .
This will work great in our very narrow space.  There are not many options for regular sinks in the narrow category unless you look for wall-mounted, which we did not want.  The faucet on top of the sink helps with this goal .
A lovely quick read that is  quite comical if you don't mind corny British humor. Written in play format, easily imaginable .
I have had the Keurig mini, B-60 and B-70 special editions. I loved the SE but it took up too much space, as I am the only coffee drinker in the home. I would have never bought this machine if I knew the trouble I was going to have.. Right away the first 3 kcups I used the cup did not even fill halfway and the coffee looked like water.. the machine does not punch into the kcup from the top. I then tried Apple Cider and the same thing.. I have to puncture the kcup myself.. Its just not a good machine. It leaks from the top and honestly I would spend 15 more next time for a different brand .
First of all I was under the impression that Pink Zebra products could not be sold on Amazon? The sprinkles melt well, but the warmers or "simmer pots" as they call them do not last well. Since Jan of 13 I have had 4 burn out and 2 lightbulbs go out in 6 separate warmers.. The company is a hassle to deal with. UGH I recommend to stick with the store brands.. Smell just as good without the hassle .
Beautiful sandals and the price was awesome, the material is really soft I didn't really expect to get that kind of quality for that low price .
I have searched for this movie forever and just couldn't find it. All of the sudden a light bulb went off and I got on Amazon. The movie is a delightful family movie. Cuba is great in the part and the dogs are hilarious. I got a copy for myself and a copy for my friend who also was searching for it .
The only place my dad could find this item was a half an hour drive. He is 88 so that isn't realistic.. He was so impressed that just like that we had his product .
Received this order fast. Tried it once so far, for a 10 minute stand up tan and I could tell right away I was darker. The smell is amazing and didn't make my skin greasy or dried out. I will keep using it and probably order another bottle once this one is done .
Beautiful skirt.  Fit is great and can't wait for the warm weather to get it on!Nice addition to my summer wardrobe .
You worth it! You are valuable, just because of you!!! She is funny, full of real life story that will make you feel, you are not the only one with weird questions .
If you need someone at your home, to inspire and help you with your daily work-out, this is the one! You won't be exhausted after, but will feel your body a little soar every day. It will make you use every muscle, but not at once. Great .
Item does not mention that there is no rotation for mount. This makes it a little hard to set straight on most windshields .
it takes quite long to arrive (app. a month by the time I ordered). However, it comes in a packet of 3 which is a very good deal. highly recommend if you are not in hurry for the product .
I order this product for my nokia lumia 710. the product material isn't as good as I expect it should be, but it fit perfectly. the outlook is exactly like in the pic. there were no crash or no crack when it arrived, so with its price i gave it 5 stars .
Definitely a low budget movie. Some scenes are like most scenes were less than 30 seconds and it did not flow very well .
Could not put it down once l got started .l love the ocean Sarah Collins is fast becoming one of my favorite authors .
The fit and color is fine,but not what I would call flannel it is bed sheet thin guess that is why the picture is set so far back, It is worth the price just know what you are realy getting .
The idea of the characters not knowing the hows and whys of the disaster were much in the vein of LOST. The connections made during the adventure especially at the end were very X-file like. I like .
Wasting time and money I'm trying to return my money back.didn't get any results my Wight was 149 and now 155 .
These are great at canceling noise. It is so much easier for me to study and work out now because I don't hear everything that is going on around me .
They are cheap in cost so don't expect much from these, they do work but the sound sounds like it is far away. the comfort is not great either, but do remember... You get what you pay for .
Not the best but if you are looking for cheap screen protectors, these will do and they do help a lot .
The thing filled 1/3 the container. I have used other pre work out powders and this one was average. Not much energy in it .
this game is so awesome. I love playing it. I was confused at first on how to play the game but now that I have it down pack, I can't stop playing it. I will recommend this game to everyone .
BAD MOVE WITH THESE LED LAMPSMy plan was to replace my Halogen Lamps of about 3000 hours life expectancy with these. Typical LED Lamps last 50,000 hours. Not only would I be saving energy, but they would be lasting 15+ times longer.Out of the (18) I purchased less than 2 months ago only two still are working.....soon to be DEAD (should be lasting YEARS).I Have bought other LED's and will continue to do so, I just won't buy these .
I simply needed some nice comfortable running shoes.I've only gone on a few runs with these, but so far I haven't had any problems.These shoes are durable, good looking, and comfortable.Strongly recommend them!5 stars here .
Very good quality.My only complaint is that lighter colors show more dirt. Not a big deal tho.I would get this product again .
I bought this item in hopes to replace my screen on my third gen iPod touch. The connection was fine, everything seems to work, however it doesn't include a home button and there is no way to clip it in place like they're supposed to.There are other screens on Amazon that I would purchase over this .
Not as good quality as the 30 year old one I am replacing but it is okay and easy to put together. I have extras to give as Christmas gifts. It is currently in my hall with coats, etc. on it .
I wrote a wonderful review when I received these shoes yesterday, they are really comfortable and cute, but today is day 2 of wearing them (for a total of about 5 hours) and the fabric that meets the heel on both shoes has started to tear and wear away due to friction on the pavement. The sole of the shoe ends about a quarter of an inch too soon, which forces the fabric right above the heel of the shoe to meet the floor when your heel touches the ground. Its too bad there is no option here to include a photo. These are not going to last very long. Buyer beware .
I feel this book really captured the perspective Claudia had of things and it helps us understand her actions better.  The story is very complete, though you will be able to enjoy it better if you read &#34; Interview with the vampire.&#34; It is however not necessary .
It keeps you on edge and it's not overly dramatic. Feels real and perhaps that's what's scary about it. I recommend it .
I ordered 120 of these lights. Only 2 of 120 did not work, but my fiance managed to fix them both.There were 4 batteries that didn't work as well.I didn't receive any extra batteries in my order like the description stated. Otherwise, I'm happy with the lights.I also tested one out last night submerged in water.I put it in at 8pm, this morning when I left for work at 7am, it was still working fine .
and i loved this movie,every minute of it,didn't get the advertising it needed,and a whole lot of problems with production,but non the less a great movie for all star wars fans,favorite part,the showdown with the trekkies!!!! lmffao .
The cable broke within the first hour using it. This is after I used another brand for six months before needing to replace. With this item you get what you pay for. Do not buy .
Tried other waxes but none compare to Cue Doctor... Leaves your shaft ultra smooth and slick. Would highly recommend this product .
The screen protector was not tight enough on the screen and dirt constantly got between the screen and the screen protector.  The back had nice grip and not too bulky, but I wouldn't recommend this case .

The exact product sold at Harbor Freight for 99cents or 2 bucks not a 100% positive.A Chinese import totally garbage no its a insult to garbage (apologies garbage:'()I've had 2 of these crack &fail..Extremely dangerous poor craftsmanship plastic...after less than twice used less than a hour totall. Save your cash .
I try to read a lot the free authors I haven't heard off to boost their ratings and Emma gets an A+.  Some of the self-published stuff I have read is terrible.  So bad I couldn't finish the first one.  I not only finished the first one but bought the second one so that should say something .
I don't read to be depressed, I read to be entertained.  Most of what I read was well written, just not the content I'm interested in .
Loved the message and we always love the videos with a positive girl message :) You can't go wrong with Veggie Tales .
My dog would not allow anyone to trim her nails. It took the vet and two technicians last time. This is the first time that she tolerated the nail trimming. She doesn't like it but it's managable and she doesn't fight me. Love it and recommend to everyone .
Good price for what I needed. Still had to purchase new bearings, but it was better than buying an 8 pack of wheels I didn't need .
New to herbal world....very informative.  Also, it mentions common uses and provides notes on proceeding with caution if certain health conditions apply like diabetes or advises not to use at all with certain conditions .
No I don't like it because was made in China, when they made the products, they used bad material to made it. They are bad for people to used it. I am afraid to use it o give to my family .
Tami Hoag does it again!!! From the first chapter to the very last word, The 9th Girl is another "can't put it down" "just one more chapter" great book. Like lots of her books, it can get graphic at times. Not overly so, but the reader definitely needs to be able to be able to picture the crime scene of a horribly murdered young girl. Also the autopsy, and the investigation of her, and other similar murders. For me, that's one of the things that makes her books so great!!!! She really brings the reader into the story. I'm not some sick and twisted serial killer, but, I love reading about them. Especially reading about the combination of the forensics and police work that help catch these people, and get them off the streets. Forensics fascinate me, and this book, has some of that, along with the thrill of the feeling that you're part of the investigation, while safely at home. It also talks about bullying and what it can lead to!!!! Also it shows how one person can make a difference by standing up against it!!!!! Great read!!!! Highly recommended it .
I have always loved Tim Conway!!!! Some of my favorite childhood memories are of sitting in the living room,with my grandparents, on Saturday nights, waiting to see what he, and Harvey Korman would do on the Carol Burnett show that week. Even as a little girl, I thought Tim Conway was hysterical!!!! Still do!!!! Whether I'm watching an interview with him, watching the DVDS of the Carol Burnett Show, or reading this book, he makes me laugh so hard, for days my stomach muscles feel like I've done a thousand sit-ups!!! I am glad I bought this book on my Kindle because now, I'll own it forever, and it won't fall apart when I've read it a thousand times!!! Highly recommend it!!!!!! Wish I could've given it 5,000 stars .
Fun, easy, but not so simple, it's boring!!! I did buy the upgrade, and I had points so it was still &amp;#34;free&amp;#34; for me. Even if I didn't I would've bought the upgrade, only $1.99 .
I was first introduced to ClariS via the television anime Ore no Imouto ga Konnani Kawaii Wake ga Nai. (My little sister can't be this cute) Oreimo  for short. Irony is the opening theme song and has a great beat and amazing lyrics. Claire and Alices' voices are like nothing you've heard before. Check it out and check out Oreimo, its a wonderful show .
GOOD! I wish you could not pay as much tax for importing it.  it was never like this before really .
it lasted around two days until stopped working, not recommend to purchase. cheap but not worthy at all. I am very disappointed .
I read this after I watched the movie.  It is an entertaining book and was not as graphic as the movie which was a good thing .
I thought it was really sung by Bruno mars! It is not. It is the tribute to him. It is NOT BEING SUNG by Bruno Mars!  I cancelled my order, and ordered the real one. IT didn't even sound like Bruno Mars. I like the real song much better. Thanks .
Word Chums is so much better than the  other word games! There are no issues! You can go on playing with no problems!  I am really happy with this Word Chums! It's great .
I love the little keyboard. It is so cute. I do wish that it has a light but, other than that I love it. I hate that I have to send it back. I bought a tablet and im sending it back so there is no reason for me to keep. I did find out though that it does with with an android phone .
Got it to have an extra battery when your out all day. I am very happy with the quality and price of this battery. Canon brand might have a bit more capacity, but not proportional to the premium price. I for one do not think brand name accessories are essential or needed .
I couldn't put it down also my wife read it . We loan it to several relative .the book s very to life as I as present at this time .
i don't think it's a 5star product. the fog lifter is 5 star I prefer columbian  over a blend, but they have done a good job of blending .
If you are a fan of Elizabeth II this book is definitely a must read. It's quite informative, but not judgemental. The only objection I had was to much focus on politics and queen's relationship with her prime ministers and far to little information about her family and other aspects of her life .
The lace part of this dress was far longer that the picture had led me to expect. I'm 165cm and 51 kg (sorry people I'm European) and the dress (size 6) fits perfectly, but while the fabric part barely coveres my behind, the lace fell well under my knees. Frankly it made me look like someone&#8217;s grandma. The dress is still beautiful and quite well made, so I decided not to send it back and had it shortened .
When i received it i tried straight away and it's wonder curler but you have to be becareful because you will not have a perfect gloves and you can hurt your fingers very easy .I was expecting to have all curl will be twisted but i have very long hair my ends looks like if it's straight the result i got wavy nice hair but i need to practice more on it so i can get better result .Am hoping that i will not hurt myself .
Higman aims to provide a succinct and abridged history of the Caribbean to a general audience, from pre-Columbian times to the present. Acknowledging first the problems that confront any attempt at coherently defining &#8220;the Caribbean,&#8221; he limits his survey to the island societies of Spanish, Dutch, French, and English heritage, omitting such territories as Florida or the Guyanas.Higman organizes the matter chronologically, starting with a synopsis of the region&#8217;s formative and ongoing geological activity and a brief biogeography. Maps and graphics of prehistoric Ta&iacute;no artifacts are used to help illustrate this &#8220;ancient archipelago.&#8221; Columbus&#8217;s four journeys to the Caribbean introduce consequences of culture-contact and prepare for environmental, economic, and social transformations that become more apparent at the end of the &#8220;second sixteenth century&#8221; (1530-1630). Slavery and its ends on plantations, backed with some demographic considerations, ground Higman&#8217;s brief primer on the two prevailing models of framing the Caribbean &#8211; plural or creole societies. Higman also traces developments from abolition to the present, using the events from the English Caribbean as a guidepost, but notes important departures in the stories of Cuba and Haiti, respectively.This nooks-and-crannies book is a fine reference textbook, and appears to streamline current opinion on the state of research on the region well &#8211; it is a friendly and intelligent digest. Its deliberate omission of in-text documentation, however, is frustrating. Finally, the absence of both the Cayman Islands and Bermuda is puzzling, considering the former&#8217;s proximity to Jamaica and the latter&#8217;s resemblance in form and function to the ABC islands of the Dutch .
I have played many games with many people and none of them ever came close to this one it's the greatest feeling when you get a new mutant or a rare one I give a thumbs up and I have 3 of them.........just joking .
Sweet and simple! I don't need anything too fancy and this works great. For some reason the original sweeper is harder to find than I thought. I love how you can mop and sweep using the same apparatus .
"Child is father of man". 'Blissful Discontent', a delightful book by Pritha Lal describes a series or epiphanies experienced by her as she took a break from her career to turn into a stay at home Mom, and watched with love as her little Parijat, so aptly named, helped her to find interesting parallels between infant behaviour and the set patterns of work behaviour in adults at their work place. Pritha says that she tried to take notice of things she had known all along "from a less than three foot tall vantage point and the view has been spectacular."Reading Mother Goose rhymes through her pregnancy quietens the "two year old child with big bug eyes", denoting familiarity, always a key word in motivation. As she grows, her amazing prowess in knowing close to two hundred words, being bilingual and retaining words with alacrity, are all linked to her parents' constant talking to her. Talking to her, never talking 'down' to her, for children are not balls of mush. They are not ignorant and their minds develop early. Finding clarity through the 'babble' is rewarding and highly motivating.Pritha, the mother, obviously takes precedence over Pritha, the professional, as she talks with pride about herself Parijat using everyday phrases like "Check it out!" , "You did it!"  and the endearing "I love you!", which, of course, she adores. Visual learning reinforces the telling of a subject, be it "sop sines" (shop signs) or "sop sop crowds" (soft soft clouds). Their little girl has  her favourite toys - get purple stuffed Barney, a pink elephant watering can, fly swatter and the like, and she values the associations attached to each one of them.Comparisons are odious and timely praise motivates. Habit formation takes time and doing things repeatedly with enthusiasm is true motivation. It is these little nuggets of wisdom that Pritha puts across brilliantly in her book, relating them with baby steps taken by her precious daughter. Barney 's influence makes magic words like "Please" and "Thank You" an essential part of the conversation, and while there are things that can be taught, there are the intangibles like sharing and caring that need to be learnt on one's own.The book ends with Winnie the Pooh's heart warming advice, adapted simply by this amazing writer. "Remove the fluff. It is so worth it .
There are some books which evoke a sense of nostalgia, passion and love, of raindrops and balmy breezes, of light predicaments and romantic trysts! &#8216;When I See Your Face&#8217; is one of those. It is the story of Cathy, who resolves to start life over, &#8220;without a husband who didn&#8217;t love her and whom she had grown to fear and avoid, if not hate.&#8221; Mark is the scheming charmer who treats her like a possession, and thinks it is his right to abuse her, whenever he is drunk.She falls in love with the picturesque little village that gives her sanctuary, as also with the intrepid Mrs. Grindle, who is like a ray of sunshine, wanting to mother and feed the young girl who has suffered so much.When she meets a stranger, Michael, who is the spitting image of her husband, Mark, her heart skips a beat in panic. The story twists and turns in most interesting ways, keeping the reader wondering as Cathy tries to come to terms with new relationships, which make her feel happy and secure. She concentrates on her own talents, so that she can make a living, all the while overwhelmed by feelings she has never felt before. One evocative line talks of how &#8220;hope was starting to grow inside her, a timid, light green shoot reaching a slim arm out of the soil and into the sunlight&#8221;.What happens when Mark and Michael come face to face?  What are the conflicts that have marred Michael&#8217;s past, and threaten to undermine his present as well? Has Cathy made an error in judgment all over again? Numerous questions tickle the mind of the readers, as events meander by.Devika has a real flair for choosing the right words and phrases to embellish the romance in her story. Never ever is there a moment when the reader feels disappointed in her style, for it remains consistently beautiful and easy to read. There is an innocence in the narrative that tugs at one&#8217;s heartstrings, and an old world charm that is missing in most modern books. It is also a story of progression, as Cathy grows stronger as a person, losing her vulnerability and low self esteem, as she finds herself able to live an independent and fulfilling life.The cover of the book exemplifies the serenity and the deep love within the hearts of the characters. If you love romance, do read &#8216;When I see your Face&#8217;! If you enjoy a twist in your tale, stretch your hand out and pick this book up! And finally, if you want to read something that makes you feel warm and happy inside, this is definitely the book for you .
Some of my baby skins areas like knees , arm pits were getting blackened due to crawling and other fun activities , we bought these mitts to clean those body areas , Those helped but not fully . my baby plays with while bathing. So it didn't serve the purpose fully but , its okay kind of product .
No Cracked lips anymore , even my hubby has started using it :) Wherever I go I keep this one with me . Its a Life Saver .
Sent using only bubble wrap envelope.  Product was cracked, prongs bent and foreign matter inside jiggled when shaken.  I don't know if product was just sent in poor packaging or also if it was manufactured poorly....maybe both! Product sold by affiliated vendor, Jane Cheung .
Great battery. Lasts a long time. I think some reviewers, who might say, it doesn't last as long as their origianal battery, don't realize, that they have more apps on their phone, that run in the background, that drain the battery now, than when their phone was new .
no matter what your age, it makes you want to go to the beachnot many lame lyrics, just great guitar .
Love it ! At first I was hesitant but I went for it and I loved it. It makes ur screen look and feel awesome. No glare from the sun. It gives your phone a nice matte look. Reccomended .
I didn't mention in my previous review that the Microsoft Step By Step books come with a CD. There are practice files to load and exercises that give the user practical help in learning to use the programs. I have not yet seen the 2007 PowerPoint book. But I expect it to be of the same quality .
It fits my phone like a glove. I don't ever have to worry bout it coming off of my phone .
If you follow True Blood, Twilight or any other pop culture vampire stories and do not take the time to read Dracula you should be ashamed.The story dragged a bit towards the end but still a must read .
A known classic and often required reading I can't believe I had not read this book earlier. A must read .
Easy to assemble, sturdy, can't beat it for the money and my dog loves having her own space.  Great Deal .
I've assembled lots of things. I recently just purchased furniture from Ikea. Assembled, no sweat.  This bed is so frustrating to put together it's taken me 3 days b/c I have to get up and walk away from it. Now that it is assembled it is not sturdy. The screws are all very loose b/c of the material that they are embedded in.  It's a cheap bed but I was expecting it to last at least a year. I may toss it before I even use it .
Item is cute but timer did not ring on the original or replacement egg. I'm very disappointed with the product .
I'm not one to sit and read a cookbook but this is such a deligtful and entertaining short read that I did review the entire thing before beginning my first batch of guacamole .
This model will not fit a ZGlock 21 Gen 4. It will not slide upon the trigger guard. Product did not ship with any instructions .
The book made a few interesting points along the way, but never grabbed you and made you want to continue reading.  An interesting life I'm sure, but if there was a message here I couldn't find it.  It's almost like the discussion on habitat.  The book was very general  (habitat) and was never specific about any one thing (habitat for a particular species .
I do a spin or RPM class twice a week @ the gym.  It was becoming increasingly more uncomfortable to tolerate the little narrow seats that these bikes are equiped with.  I didn't want to go with a pair of bike shorts as I do other workouts there also.  These liners fit the bill perfectly.  They have enough padding in the right places & are not conspicous under my regular gym shorts.  I've since bought a second pair and will probably own a third before the end of the year just to make it easier to keep them laundered and ready for use .
This is by far the BEST screen protector ever. The easiness and the quality are really there.I have tried couple of screen protectors before but none of them was as easy to install as this one.For the first time i ever. i was able to install a screen protector in a minute or so without having tons of bubbles. In fact i had absolutely no bubbles at all.I will always buy ismooth screen protectors from now on .
This speaker is simply unbelievable!. The sound very loud and best thing of all is that it has real punchy bass. Even at high volumes the speaker never distort. I was really surprised by how good these speakers are.I own the following bluetooth speakers:GoGroveHMDX JamHMDX Jam PlusKinivo MiniSuper Bass Portable SpeakerX-mini Max II Capsule Speakersand after testing all of them i can say that the Sharkk BoomBox is a killer! There's no comparison at all. Previously, the HMDX Jam Plus was in my opinion the best portable bluetooth speaker, but after using this Sharkk BoomBox i can say that the Sharkk is the best portable bluetooth speaker Period.The reason behind this great sound is the fact that this speaker has two main &#34;High frequency&#34; mini speakers and one &#34;low frequency subwoofer&#34; speaker at the back. The two main in the front provide the awesome distortion free vocals while the one in the back is punching the bass. The combination of both the mini speakers and a the subwoofer provided the best music experience in portable speakers.So, the bottom line is go for it you will never regret it .
Very good purchase. Spacious, practical and good fit bag for both mums and dads. Quality/ price ratio is there and there should be no reasons for you to be disappointed. Item is exactly as described .
The item was as described an was well packaged..Installed the item an no problem on the touch response.. Works like new lol .
i have this case in pink also for my iPad and now i am not so scared my kids will drop it/ my daughter has no case and she broke her ipad screen but dropping it once .
good afternoon arrived this product not appreciate me send me as soon as possible or return the money as it is a Christmas present and I would not leave bad grade but I have not received and you charged me does not seem right .
I love this series it is great can't wait to read the newest book. Thank Kate McMullan for such an amazing book and series .
A beautifully written love story that you won't want to put down and will want more when the story ends.  Superb .
With characters that the readers can relate to and relationships that feel reminiscent of our own lives, Stay offers an intriguing and steamy story about navigating love and life, never missing a detail about the pinnacles and pitfalls and everything in between.  You won't want to put it down and will be on the edge of you seat waiting for the next one .
High quality sponges filters,pack of 3,lightweight but very dense quality,worked well in my set up and let nothing threw that shouldn't be there .
This is a great shower-head that was well worth the price. Very powerful after I replaced one that was barely providing any pressure. The only downfall to this specific shower-head (to me at least) is that it is not adjustable .
These are the best lip glosses for the selection of colours, taste, texture and absolutely the best lip plumpers. They work long-term, they don't sting. I've been using different shades of this wonderful product for years and will continue to do so. Although, I have tried most other ones. This one is the best .
This rice cooker is perfect for our little family of 3.I was looking for a smaller zojirushi rice cooker, i had the zojirushi neuro fuzzy 10-cups rice cooker and it was huge.At first the non stick coating on my neuro fuzzy was starting to peel off and i needed a replacement pan.There's none available, even on zojirushi's website. The replacement pan was about $50+shipping.So when amazon had this no-fuss zojirushi rice cooker on sale for less than 50 bucks, i jumped on the deal.I keep the fancy neuro fuzzy in the basement now, and my new rice cooker is just perfect .
We purchased a similar folding potty seat before this one (with cushion), but it was so unstable and made my daughter scared of sitting on adult toilet.This one is so perfect!It has non slip rubber on the base so it doesn't move and she has handle to hold on to so that she won't touch the dirty public toilet.I always bring a disinfectant wipe so i can wipe the seat after she's done.When folded, they are both similar in size although maybe this one is a bit longer but its thinner because it has no cushion.I like this seat better than the cushioned-version one, hands down .
The water flows really well (controlled flow) even my toddler can drink it in the car without spilling.It keeps the water cool during summer too. I got it when amazon had 40% sale, and I regret that I didn't buy more .
I was looking for a non-leaking, no straw bottle, and this is the perfect bottle for me.Although, you have to be careful not to drop it when the cap is not on because the water would just spill out.It fits well in my car's cup holder too and priced well (it was on sale for about $7 .
I'm looking to get a cheap retractable razor to open packages because i'm not strong enough (like my husband) to just rip the packages/carton boxes open.It works well, the blade is so sharp and i can just snap the tip if it gets dull.For a set of 3 knife set, the price is good too.Overall i'm happy with this purchase .
No more olay wet cleansing cloth. I tried to remove my eye makeup and it stinks real bad!I tried the other wet wipes too (by Olay) and they all hurt my eyes .
Updated review:After 5 months using this mat, I'm very impressed.Its easily cleaned and now the mat is flat on the floor, i didn't even do anything to straighten it!Love this mat! I'm planning to get another one for my husband's office.I'm looking for a sturdy clear plastic to cover my hardwood floor from my daughter's messy eating habit.The other kids floor covers are either flimpsy or has kidddy pattern.This mat works great because it allows the crumbs to dry and i can just sweep or wipe. So much easier to clean than hardwood floor.The only downside is the wrinkles that comes from folding it in the box when it was delivered.I'm not sure how can i make it straight but for now it works okay for us .
This cleansing cloths hurt my eyes, when i tried to remove my eye makeup it stinks my eyes!I won't be buying any olay wet wipes anymore. I tried the Olay regenerist micro-exfoliating wet too and it also hurt my eyes.I prefer neutrogena wipes, they're gentler in removing my eye makeup .
The brush has a very strong plastic smell when it first came, the smell stayed on my daughter hair when i used it. So gross.I cleaned it with mild soap and water. The smell is still there but bearable after a day.My daughter's hair is very fine, frizzy and tangled all the time. Even sitting for a few minutes on her car seat makes her hair frizz and in knots.The brush works well and she's not in pain.I need to stroke more to untangle her hair because the bristle is shorter and reach less hair than other "traditional" brush.This brush comes in a mirror-like blue and very nice. My daughter loves it.I love this brush, i wish it doesn't have that plastic smell .
I bought this for my daughter's bed. We are currently potty training her.At first it smells like plastic but I air it out for a few days and the smell is gone.The top part is terry cloth and the other side is plastic material.It doesn't make any crinkle sound when she sleeps on it, so it doesn't bother her sleep.She wet her bed once and i didn't change the bed right away because i have to clean her up.The urine didn't leak. It is waterproof.All in all, we love this mattress protector .
It is used book but it did not answered my expectations, it is pretty old. Besides, there is not any missing page and it is good for study .
It is something that you must have. After this machine i lessen my potato cutting time by one hour. Now i and my roommates eat potato whenever we want. Also it is price is nothing besides it is usefulness .
Very nice figures for Beatles fans. They are for decorative purposes, though, not to play with them (very limited articulated movements .
The board, bank notes and cards are very nicely decorated with the Yellow submarine film's characters/scenes. The only thing I don't like much is that &#34;houses&#34; and &#34;hotels&#34; are named &#34;friends&#34; and &#34;submarines&#34; but the plastic figures are still the same classic houses and hotels. It would have been great if &#34;submarines&#34; were actually yellow submarines .
I was very happy with these coveralls ...... very warm and durable.  The size runs a little large.  Sorry I didn't buy this after the price dropped .
I like it and it doesn't jam up like my previous one. I feel a little safer than before I got this .
I read some of the reviews and with the key notes of the fragrance itself was a great buying factor in my purchase. This is a very lovely scent. My nieces love this so much I had to hide the bottle so they wouldn't spray it all over them. Looking forward to purchasing more scents from this line .
The controler is not an original but it works fine n my kid likd it!! I would buy another one if I ever need it .
Very handy, very reasonable. If staff lose one, or customers forget to return one, it is not a major expense .
For the reasonable price, they definitely fill my need, with no concern if I lose one.Would surely purchase again.Very good .
I haven't finished this book yet, but so far I'm enjoying it very much.  Very well-written, and very thought provoking.  I love historical novels anyway, and this subject matter is interesting...former slaves who now own slaves.  A good book, to me, is one that has good character development so that you care about and want to learn more about them.  This does that for me, and I'm looking forward to sharing their journey.  I would recommend it to any historical novel reader like myself .
I have been collecting these Southern Living Christmas books since 1995, and this year was just as wonderful as all the rest.  These are my go-to reference books for Christmas decorating, crafts and wonderful recipes for not only entertaining, but family holiday meals. I've found that while I save all my Christmas issues of the magazine, these books are what I always reference because everything I need is here in one volume. I love the complete menus for different holiday meals and entertaining.  The depicted decor is also just lovely, and offers several different ideas from rustic to elegant.  I'm happy to add this 2013 version to my collection .
Since I'm already a fan of Country Living magazine, I felt that this would be a good source for ideas.  I was not mistaken.  Lots of beautiful photographs to get ideas from.  I would not limit it to &#34;country&#34; alone.  I love English Country and French Country decorating styles, and this book had numerous photographs that easily fit those categories.  Loved it .
This is the best tool for diagnosing and correcting light strands that don't work...it is super simple to use.  The manufacturer's website has every video you need to easily repair any burned out strand even on outdoor lighted decor.  It also comes with very detailed instructions in the package.  We used it on our pre-lit tree where we had two problems.  One-one strand wasn't burning at all.  My husband simply used the tool as instructed and traced the wiring to the bulb that was causing the problem.  Voila!  No more burned out strand!  And, two-we had one bulb in another strand that was loose.  Once again, it took less than 5 minutes to find the loose bulb and voila...no more problem.  All I can say is that I wish we had this when we donated a pre-lit tree after hours of trying to repair it.  All our family members have borrowed mine, corrected their problems in minutes, and now I know what to get them for Christmas.  Buy this product...you will not be disappointed .
I read the reviews for these candles before I purchased them, and was very happy with this product!  I got the last 3 that were available, and now wish I had ordered enough for all our windows.  I was a little skeptical of battery operated candles since I had others in the past where the batteries only lasted a few days at the most.  The candles performed beautifully...stayed on from dusk until dawn from the day I put them out until I took them down a few days after Christmas (15 days).  I put all the batteries in them at the same time, and made sure to follow the directions so that the on/off sensor was facing out.  I also liked that you can choose between a solid light or flickering or off.  I used the flickering glow since we live in an old farmhouse, and they looked just like candles burning in the window!.  We didn't have any other outside lights to combat the nice light from the candles.  The light is abit dim, so if you're looking for something bright white like most Christmas lights, you might not like these, but I loved them! t I took the batteries out when I packed them away until next year to avoid something switching them back on while they're in storage.  I sent the company a message to let me know when more are in stock.  Hope these become available again .
I am very happy with this Ahnu boot.  The comfort, great style and color is exactly what I was looking for.  After reading several of the reviews, I decided to go 1/2 size larger, but it actually is just a little large for me.  I normally wear a size 7.  It's not a big problem since I only wear these in the winter months, and adding a second pair of thin socks with my wool socks makes it fit perfectly.  I became familiar with the brand from a pair of very similar boots that I ordered for my husband.  I am not disappointed, and would happily buy this brand again.  Great boot for the money .
I would recommend this Book to everyone, simple recipes with no &#34;fancy&#34; ingredients!!!I'm ready for more books like this one .
Same thing with this item was too big, because I do not put the word mini in the model that I really needed that was Samsung galaxy s3mini. I hope is fine. The sticks are good .
These helped a ton! Was able to pump a lot more a lot faster. Made it fit so much better too. Better fit=less/no pain and less time attached to the pump .
I like this diaper cover. I'm not sure it would have fit her at 4lbs, but it fits around 7lbs for sure, which is why I just give it 4 stars. My daughter has itty bitty chicken legs and is very long and skinny, so I think that is why it didn't fit quite right at first. I love that the aplix tabs overlap. The snap versions of this diaper, which we also have, don't fit quite as well since they don't overlap at the waist. It's adorable on babies. Gives them a larger bottom so we had to go up to 0-3 instead of newborn clothes when she wears these diapers. It holds everything in, unlike the disposables. Definitely recommend this diaper for those first few months before the one size diapers fit .
This monitor far surpassed our expectations. The picture is very clear, night vision and daytime color. It seems to have a shorter battery life than I expected, but it's not short by any means. Just plug it in and recharge it when it's not being used. It doesn't pick up every single little sound our daughter makes, but it picks up 99% of them. It even picks up doors closing, loud cars on the road outside, and the furnace kicking on and off. I love being able to see what my daughter is doing in real time, not pixelated, and also hear her .
I love this seat. We chose it for how sturdy it looks and is, cute factor (cow print) was a bonus, and the height/weight limit. This car seat not only looks sturdy, it feels sturdy. It supports my daughter's head well and the plastic isn't flimsy. She falls asleep right away in it too. We didn't use the infant foam as our daughter fit better without it, even with her birth weight at 6lb 8oz and 20.5" long. It fits in our 1999 Subaru forester in a side position with the base, but the front seat has to be all the way forward and that makes it so no one can sit up there. It fits in the middle back seat without the base. It also fits exceptionally well in our 2002 dodge ram quad cab. We don't have the latch system in our vehicles, so we use the seat belt to install it. Not hard at all. Just have to push the base down and get it tight enough. I highly recommend this seat if you are searching for one. It's not overly heavy and bulky. It's bigger than others, but it's also sturdier. It's definitely not too heavy (I'm only 5'3", 120lbs and I can carry it easily .
May end up returning. Battery only lasted about 20 minutes the first time we unplugged it after being plugged in about 36 hours. The sound and picture are kinda weird too. We also don't like that it shuts off the video after 4 minutes when run on battery. It still has sound, but you have to push a button to get the video back for another 4 minutes. We bought this because we needed a second monitor for the new baby and liked the idea of the pan/tilt from the parent control. The pan/tilt is great. We really like that. I wish that the Infant Optics monitor had that option. We have the Infant Optics DXR-5 for our other kid and prefer that one over this. If we return it, we will get a second Infant Optics and just have to have 2 hand consoles to watch each kid in their rooms so that we can have constant coverage of both rooms .
I was searching for a good zoom lense, I narrowed down my search to 70-300mm and 55-250mm IS II. I did lota reasearch and selected 55-250mm IS IIIS II specificaly coz as the name suggest IS &#34;image stabilization&#34; and I needed it badly since I was not a pro then but after 6 months of use, I say this is the one that I needed. Yes the price, It is resonable for an IS II and I didn't have plans of spending more, otherwise I would have gone for 70-300mm IS .
my first heli a bit of a challenge in a small space or outdoors but that's what i was looking for as its pretty fast. responsive. cheap, durable and loads of fun a great starter as ive crashed it countless times brought it to a birthday party and my brother and nephew are now placing orders how cool will that be,, i also ordered the big bag of parts and 5 pack of 200 mha batterys at the same time and i get better performance and longer flight time other recomindations are to protect the wiring on the rear motor i used heat shirnk tubing around the whole motor.. manually adjust the rods that connect the rotor and fly bar to the swash plate if it don't hover close to in one place then fine tune with the trim buttons and remember you tube is your freind .
then one one of ports that hold the battery in  place pulled out with the battery didn't even notice till I tried to install battery in heli im sure its fixable with some gum and a stick lol .
Just got today. Has AMAZING quality to it. Let me start out by saying that it arrived very very quickly, and in perfect boxing. Took it out to find an owners manual and the product. Very easy and simple to connect blue-tooth keyboard. Ipad snaps right in place easy with no hassle. Provides great protection for it and definitely would look forward to getting another one of New Trent's items. 5 stars all the way. Keyboard seems a little small for my hands, but im sure i will adjust quite easily.Bottom line.Amazing quality for an amazing price .
I read this book in one day. The strength and will of this family is truly amazing. Their story is heart wrenching but at the same time their will to keep fighting not only for their two little boys but for others with this horrible disease. I say a prayer everyday for Jason, Justin and their family and they wi always be in my heart X's two .
I bought this product to be sent as a gift to Venezuela. What a bad moment when I received a call thanking me for a product that did not work. Get what you care... Don't buy this .
Compr&eacute; este tel&eacute;fono para traerlo a Vzla y todo va muy bien. Excelente vendedor altamente recomendado a toda la comunidad .
The watch looks great. Its only 3ATM  water resistant means you can only get wet in the rain or wash your hand with it on, not for swimming, snorkeling, etc. the description says 99 feet depth thats all wrong the watch says on the back only 3atm. Other than that i love this watch .
Looks very nice with my white phone. At the beginning i could not get it off, then i dropped my phone and broke the screen.It looks very cool but it will not protect your phone .
it look very cute but it won't hold together if you drop it.good for looks but bad for protection .
I ordered this item and it shipped one day later than mentioned, although not a big deal. It also worked (pretty well) for 2 days and not does not work at all. When plugged in, it no longer lights up or turns on. It also had a VERY strong plastic odor smell that made me nervous. I am very unhappy and upset that i wasted my money and my patience on this order .
Not really sure how well it worked....i used it as more of a precaution than anything.Might work! Not sure .
Really annoying to put on. I had to try / waste 3 different covers to try and get the placement right and all the bubbles out. Corners lift too...won't buy again :(I would rather just go somewhere and have them put it on for me .
I couldn't find this tea anywhere after being able to buy it at the supermarket, so i had to get it off here. Really nice flavor .
Super cute! :) Glad i ordered this. Had it on for a few weeks, never take it or my pandora bracelet off. Hasn't tarnished .
Unfortunately the case does not have enough clearance to have on my phone while trying to charge it. You will need to take the case off. Also, the stickers are super cute but they pop right off and leave a sticky film residue .
I bought this item a few weeks back. Right after opening the package I found that only a few of the cables worked. More not working than are. A little disappointed, as I was going to give a couple to my mom and sister but couldn't once I realized they did nothing when connected to the iphone cube and to my phone .
Have used it for many years. No after affects. Works great.This item is no longer available locally. Glad I could still get it on line .
great songs,but wouldn't have bought it if I knew it was live,my fault I guess,wasn't looking for live version.have to be more careful .
I really didn't like the swearing but it is a good book to read! i kinda did like it .
I have not gotten the chance to read this particular novel by R.A. Salvatore yet, as I am reading the Cleric Quintet, but I can hardly contain my excitement .
I have read through this book but have not actually used the techniques yet.It breaks many different locks into barney-style techniques to pick, rake, force open .
I have no idea what the other reviewers received, but my tuna came fast and is perfect! just the right size chucks and a pink color .
I am not too crazy about this product yet. I have not been taking it long enough to make a well determined call on if it is working or not yet .
I have not been on this product long enough to be able to make a good call on whether it is working or not yet .
This is a great product. At first I did not think that it worked, but the next time I used it I applied a little more and I could feel it working .
This Black Weatherproof Warm Nylon Faux Fur Pilot Aviator Trooper Trapper Hat is amazing! Nothing helps beat the cold Afghnistan wind than a hat like this .
Great product! I am impressed. I bought it to protect my cigarettes while I am on patrol, and it does just that! hard plastic case can withstand a 200lb Marine laying on it in full battle-gear. The dispenser is easy to fill and easy to utilize. The only con is that it does not come with lighter fluid. Great buy nonetheless .
This product is great! Exactly what i ordered, exactly what i received in the mail. I can not wait to give it a try .
i received this item to my FPO AP in afghanistan two days prior to when it said it would be here. i was estatic. they are light and seem to be a good beginner knife, but you cannot go wrong with only 7 dollars. i would buy this again .
The game is awesome, i have beaten it multiple times on my xbox 360. the computer game however, you need steam to play. i am in a place where i can't get downloads, so now this game is worthless .
These shoes are awesome! They're comfortable (way better than wearing my boots and working out in boots and utes). They did not even really need to be broken in. Good purchase .
Great product! I got def more than i needed though. I am not sure what I am going to use all this Hook/loop fastener for, but def worth the money .
fun so far. graphics are very good and it does not take ridiculously fast motions to have fun with this game .
I cannot wait for this!!! I am a super fan since the beginning.  I wish Lynch would make Laura Palmer's Diary into a movie .
I had the privilege of working with Roger in person as he was developing this book, and I can personally attest to its impact. Through the simple lessons learned through this text, I was able to gain control of my ulcerative colitis for the first time in seventeen years; I was also able to gain muscle tone, lose fat, and start an exercise program for the first time in my life. Roger's clear, insightful, logical, sustainable, and kind approach to explaining WHY certain dietary changes are necessary makes all the difference. There is no yelling, lecturing, jargon, or hype - Roger's writing is engaging, clear, and taps in to both your common sense and the heart of what is holding you back on your path to better health. As a lifelong exercise-phobe, and someone who is skeptical about &#34;fad&#34; diets, I found Roger's approach to both movement and eating to make it easy and feasible to make changes that I believed in, without having to force myself to believe in things I didn't. I have shared this e-book with my friends and family already, and I really suggest it to anyone who is looking to make a profound shift in their health .
Good fit.  Need to order more and trash the old!  Undies don't last forever!  My time is running out at age 80 - have to get ready for the Arthritic pool program .
When I learned about this product, I had to have one!  I live alone and didn't like to deal with coffee grounds.  Now I have a wide range of hot drinks!  My friends love to pick a drink of their choice .
I agree with all of the other 5 star reviews!  I did think that this would replace my need for a moisturizer.  However, it wasn't enough on its own.  I still use a daily moisturizer before I use Miracle skin.  I've used clinique, mac, bare essentials, cover girl, etc.  This is by far my favorite that I have used.  It is a light coverage and the reviews were correct you need to go a shade darker than you normally would .
THESE PURPLE THINGS ARE JUNK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I will never buy from anywhere other than Weed Thrasher again!!!These last only seconds and are very much junk!!!!!!!!!I have had my weed thrasher for many years and the originals will do my entire yard....over an acre and a half .
did not hold up to the kind of work i do . We take 1000 of photos a week . It just could not keep up .
We went to several stores and could not find this CD. My finace wanted it badly!! So, I found it on line and purchased it for him. We listen to it everytime we're in the car together. I love Will Downing. We both are fans. He does not get enough air play on the radio. I haven't heard one song from this CD on the radio. They need to play him more .
I LOVED THE STORY THE AUTHOR MAKES THE CHARACTERS FEEL SO ALIVE YOU WILL FOLLOW  THE CHARACTER OF AELENA AND CARLIN AS THEY BATTLE FOR A NEW NATION AND FALL IN LOVE A GREAT READ DID NOT WANT THE STORY TO END .
I love this story a truly well written story. it  is so gripping full of twist and turns going from present to past a well written story. can't wait for second book .
A COMPELLING LOVE STORY WITH SOME MYSTERY  I LOVE THIS STORY IT IS WELL WRITTEN FAST PACED IT WILL HAVE YOU READING NON STOP CANT WAIT TO READ THE SECOUND BOOK TO SEE WHAT IS HAUNTING RANIA AND WILL ADAM AND RANIA BE ABLE TO CONCORD THEIR INNER DEMONS AND FIND TRUE HAPPYNESS .
A WELL WRITTEN MEDICAL THRILLLER A MUST READ STORY HAD ME HOOKED READING BOOK 2 NOW GREAT JOB THIS BOOK WILL NOT DISAPOINT .
I would give this book 5 stars!!! It was such a enjoyable reading I couldn't put the book down. Recommending it .
I bought one for my Daughter and Daughter in law . Both have new baby girls. I was very pleased with the quality. For the price it couldn't be beat. I was also pleasantly surprised when I got to the shopping cart and shipping was free on these items .
Love the bottoms but ordered wrong size probably needed a small.  The xsmall rode very low in front but I still wore it because I was in Cancun and no one cares there .
Loved this bikini top but it definitely fits as shown in picture so if you don't want that much cleavage and side shown, then not bikini for you .
I been playing this game for about a month now, and since yesterday my game has been erased I have spent about $ 80 on the game and I'm very upset with this whole situation please someone help me I don't know what to do .
Not worth it go buy the regular version. I regret every single day knowing that I paid 100$ for a huge turd .
This is great fun!!! I chose it to brighten my day @ the office. I would ask it silly or serious questions, and get a laugh out of the answers, wich are weirdly mostly spot on. Everybody coming in to my office picks it up just to have a laugh.It's the first time that I have seen one, so I cannot compare to any other objects.I can reccomend this for old & young, everybody who has a sense of fun .
This protector was what I expected.-No glare-Has a smooth feel to it-Shipping was fast-Instructions included-Fits perfectlyI am really happy with this item so far.Only negative is that I do have a few bubbles at the top right corner. I didn't get it on perfectly straight so maybe the next one will be better.Justin .
It is most certainly a celebration. This book makes a great gift for those interested in New Mexico. Not necessarily a critical view but nonetheless worthwhile .
This dash unit was easy to install and works great, but there are small holes in the back, so don't put anything small in the cubby or youll lose it forever .
As soon as i picked them up i noticed the ink cartridges were lighter than the empty ones i had.. weird i thought, and when i turned my printer on after installing these cartridges, it still said i was low on ink.. ugh, no good, now ill have to buy more.. rediculous .
The lights look nice, but they don't display the light evenly, my speedometer is brightest on 40 80 and 140, the othe side of the dash is just dim, i love the color, but the lights just dont display an even light thru the dash .
I love the functions this player has to offer, and works great, connects bluetooth with my ipad and phone with no issues and pretty easy to use, i haven't figured out yet how to hook up the DVD player to work, it just flashes e-brake muust be applied, but i didnt hook that wire to anything, may get to it someday.UNFORTUNATLEY, the one feature i really wanted to have, i cannot use, the bluetooth phone system, the calls come great thru the speakers, but noone can ever hear what I am saying unless i shout, and im not a quiet talker, but i have had to stop using it all together because the people im talking to are always complaining they cant hear me.If your looking to use this radio for calls, I would keep looking, there was only 1 review when I bought this, it basically said its decent for a cheapie, so i didnt have much to base it onHope this helps .
I love this case. It is so handy so that I don't have to drop my phone. Everyone who saw it wanted to know where I got it .
Just received this controller, and hoped for too much. the plastic feels cheap and clacky, and the buttons need firm, hard presses to get response from, specially thebuttons for moving right. i find i might be able to fix this if i open the controller and nudge a few pieces with some extra reinforcements, but for the average consumer, that shouldn't be necessary, and not everyone would have the know-how or the motivation for it.secondly, the driver is an issue as well, as it seems to have a mind of it's own to when it will allow the controller to work. it's a problem, because the pc won't always recognize the driver, or let the controller work, even when i'ts connected. This is only an increasing problem, as there's no alternative to this controller's driver.overall: it works, if you know how to make it work. nothing more, nothing less .
It used to be that I'd have to plug in my phone at some point during the day.  Now I have 60% of the battery left at the end of the day.  I've never even had to consider using the second battery.  I'm now able to install a lot of battery-killing apps and use my phone to it's fullest extent .
I've been using this since I bought it is really nice, I use for my camera and I never run out space .
Great really love it can't waitto finish the rest of the book really excited ys moom cant wait for it .
The box was broken and was so dirty. One can't consider this as a gift. Stand is uneven and can't stand properly. I would never consider this for gift .
These were just what I expected! Awesome sturdy, stiffer leather that I know will get better with age and last for years with proper care. These might seem like they run narrow at first, but this is due to the quality of the leather which will give over time. The fit is a bit shallow over the fore-foot and toe. The lack of volume here may make using an additional full insole uncomfortable, however a 3/4 insole works just fine and doesn't cramp the toes. I wear a US 7.5 or an 8 and the Euro 38 was a perfect fit. I reccomend waterproofing with a wax based product like Sno-seal or a similar product made by Dr. Marten. Also, conditioning from time to time will help keep the leather supple. I had been wanting to try a pair of Kickers for years and am glad I finally did .
This is a great jacket, but 3 stars because I recieved the Mighty Lite II as opposed to the current model, the Mighty Lite III, listed here. Have tried all incarnations of this jacket and the subtle design tweaks in the Mighty Lite III made for an improved fit for me. Previous models were oddly narrow at the top of the sleeve, with uncomfortable seams in the pit area. My arms and shoulders are not big. I'm 5'5, 130, and a small in the Mighty Lite III is a more comfortable fit for wear with light or no layers vs. the previous models. That being said, I had to send the Mighty Lite II back and get the III directly from Columbia. Dissapointing to pay full price for an older model, when you can spend the same on the current updated version... which is what I thought I was getting here. Someone dropped the ball! Great jacket with great features, though. Figure flattering. Great as a mid-layer when it's very cold. Love the thumb-hole cuffs! Worth the trouble to get the right one .
I enjoyed this book. It brought me back to my past where I identified with the main character in terms of her feelings and coming of age. I did find Delaney to be unworthy of her but can't say its a crime for a girl to fall for a person who has flaws. Ultimately he is also coming of age and realizes the value of this person. He learns.  It's very real. I enjoyed this book very much and look forward to the authors next novel .
I should have known with the price the product would be cheap.  We used it one evening and within less then 3 hours the numbers on the balls rubbed off and were not legible and the cage was exactly what a paid for.....cheap .
Not the best quality out there, but perfect for the price.  It was used for a fund raiser so it was exactly what we needed .
When I saw the release for The Bones of Others, I had recently finished reading the Evil Trilogy (which by the way, was fabulous, keeping me on the edge of my seat throughout the entire series) The name sold me and Vickie didn't let me down.  This was a great story with plenty of action suspense and romance. So excited for the next one .
I am now officially a fan of the Kinncaid brother series. Jaycee gives the perfect balance of  intense suspense and hot 'n'steamy !!!  I'm already bummed that I am starting book 3 and there are only 5 Kinncaid brothers...... Maybe Katie and Jock will adopt.........  anyway, I am absolutely loving this series, I can't seem to put them down .
Such a great series.  I read all 5 books in two weeks, couldn't put them down!! Jaycee does such a great job of getting the reader invested in the characters and gives such intense plot lines that you don't want to stop reading. I fell in love with the Kinncaid family and am so sad that Jock n Katie didn't have 10 boys so the series can continue.  Maybe a story with Brody??????  I am now a huge fan of Jaycee's stories.  I read Hunted as well and it was awesome.  Time for me to go look for another Jaycee Clark book .
Such a great book! I couldn't put it down! Jaycee Clark gives meaning to the word thriller.  She has a way with words and characters that she keeps you completely engrossedits rough the entire story. I would LOVE to see a sequel ........ Or two, or three .
I HIGHLY Recommend this wonderfully written book. Be it through a book or electronic. So well written and truly helps you see things in a different manner. I recently lost my hero, my father, and this has helped to heal some of my pain. I love James Van Praagh and Doreen Virtue shines bright also. Do Not be fooled by this size. It packs a punch and a bunch of helpfulness on each and every page. Many hugs to all. Much Love and Light .
LOve this. I keep everything in one place. I hide the book when i leave the house. Don't keep it near the computer. Wonderful little nicely done book. HIGHLY Recommend for anyone with many passwords, or forgetful like me. My memory is not what it was when i was younger and this is a true asset. Nicely done .
I cannot say enough good about Alastair Sim. This is a must have. I HIghly recommend it. It is a tradition for me and my family to watch this beginning around Thanksgiving. It is heart warming.

Everyone should have a couple in their car. Many uses, too. I gave everyone in the family a couple in their Christmas stockings, and some friends for in their cars. being in the Cold NY state, never know when you may need some extra protection from the weather. All campers, and Hikers should have these too. HIGHLY Recommend this product .

A Trustworthy seller .
Wonderful. I have super dry skin with eczema and this has in the 3 days i have been using it helped lots.

HIGHLY Recommend buying from this seller too. Packages arrive in a timely and well packaged manner. An Honest, Reliable seller for sure. Happy Holidays .

Fast shipping. Reliable, Honest seller. HIGHLY Recommend them. Buy from with confidence. I love having new fresh clean ear bud pads. Keep your ear buds nice and fresh .
I cannot say enough good about this movie. I had missed it in the Theatre, and was upset. I HIGHLY recommend this stunningly filmed, and family friendly movie. I am so glad i caught it on Starz, and came to Amazon.com to purchase it in Blue ray/3d/dvd 4 pack combo. I would wish that every family would spend a couple hours watching this interesting, beautiful, addictive to watch film. I hope with all my heart they make a follow up to the movie.I am sure many folks that missed it at the theatre, will appreciate it on film in their own home. Our new 3D television makes watching this in 3D, an added bonus. I appreciate the blue ray with commentary too. Draws your attention to what you may have missed the first time around. Makes a wonderful gift to give or receive. HIGHLY Recommend.AAA .
This is a must have size for us shellac ladies. I am so happy i bought the bigger size, so i don't run out quickly. My daughter and I love doing our nails, so I highly recommend this for all women. Nice size. Wonderful product .
this is a helpful tool on putting your hunger in check. It does curb it for a few hours, but the taste to me, im sorry to say, i could not stand it. I tried many times to force myself to keep using but just cannot. May you find this product better suited to you. The seller is fast at shipping. Products arrive safe and sound and super fast .
SO SO SO happy I purchased these.Leave your BIG bottles at home, and get this pump!! Got a few family members, perfume and cologne for Christmas, and now they can take it with them, easily. Even my husband wanted one for his cologne, for me to take with us on vacation and keep in my purse, but he could have easily kept it in his pocket. Lighter sized, not bulky. Classy and well made. Will be buying more for gifts again i am sure. Friends, I told, about this gift to, are interested in purchasing these also. Glad to have an Honest, Reliable seller to deal with. Happy shopping .
I took this on a cruise i went on, that Halloween fell on one of the days at sea. Wore a cute black skirt and top, and went as a belly dancer/Egyptian. You use your imagination and there could be many more uses for this. Great quality. NOT CHEAPLY made. I plan on using it in the future as surprising hubby night, all dressed up for anniversary gift. LoL. HIGHLY Recommend for so many uses. Role play? great for that too .
Thanks for having a big box of these all in one place and easily shipped to my home. I don't get out too often, and when i Do, i hate hunting for a bargain on batteries. These AAA are called for in almost all my remotes, and indoor/outdoor thermometers. I use them in my uv/light toothbrush cleanser, flashlight, and on and on. Wonderful purchase. Thanks for the ease in obtaining .
Love this. So wonderful to have many ports for my laptop or computer desktop. I am always charging my Zune, or camera, or Kindle, and have never had enough USB ports until now. Also like the built-in current protection system. Just Plug & Play. No installing of a drive. Vertical ports. Great .
Cannot say enough good on the variety of these colors. I bought them in anticipation of spring 2014, as it is now winter 2013 in New York state. Will enjoy them for sure .
Im so happy so very happy. Wonderful colors. Have the original white turbie twist, and finally treated myself to something i use all the time. Missed it immensely on my cruise and vacation, had forgotten it at home. Now one will stay in my suitcase as a reminder, and will refresh it, just before vacation. Never want to be without it again. My hair is long, and those Hotel/Cruise ship towels, are either TOO big or TOO tiny, to wrap up all my hair in, could not find one anywhere on the cruise for sale or on any of the side trips. HIGHLY Recommend for anyone in the hospital or nursing home, great to wrap up your hair in, so light and absorbent .
Wonderful large purse. Great for shopping, trips and a must have for your next plane ride. Everything fits in one bag. Notebook, phone, passport, makeup, tickets, extras. NO problem. Highly recommend for the commuter too .
Looked forward to playing this each and every single day during the Holiday season. Could not wait to play it. Fun and Well worth the money. Highly recommend .
I gave this book three stars because the story was ok, but it was not very exciting. At times it was hard to follow the writers style of writing. Reading it gave me something to do on a four hour flight .
I have purchased 6 pairs of crocs and have not been disappointed with any of them they are the best walking shoes I have never bought I wore them everyday on vacation my feet never got tired from walking all day at the theme parks would purchase again .
This was not my kind of thing to read. Too fantasy like and was really out there. I also have many questions after reading this .
i just got mine and the qualities pretty amazing for price i can't hear any background noise and i love the color .
We bought one of these about 6 months ago and within  a week my entire family was completely sold on it !!!  They are a wonderful device and every home should have at least one !  I have actually purchased 3 of them and just bought one for my father.  I have yet to change the batteries and have had not a single problem.  I was also very smitten with the ease of installation.  I am not the handiest person in the world but was able to install and program the lock, without help, in less than 10 minutes.  My only advice to any potential user is to replace the door knob with a knob without a lock on it - this keeps anyone from locking the knob before pulling the door shut.  I bought &#34;passage&#34; knobs for each door from Home Depot for $11.00 ea. - boom, no accidental lock out .
It's just not worth it! Everything doesn't taste good. isa small, thin book. If i had known what the book was going to be like I would not have bought it. I find better things that are just a healthy for you on te internet .
WASTE OF MONEY! Did not work!!!!! I am doing better not taking this and just being careful with what I eat and the amount I eat. WASTE of Money .
I tried this and I did not lose one single pound! Infact... it made my BM's a different color and my stomache hurt ALL the time. Not a good product .
I bought this for a little girl after seening it on tv. It looked like it was going to be really awsome gift for a 7 year old.... When we started to play with the makeover mirror it was slow and kinda difficult to understand what to do and what all you could do with the product... Over all the 7 years was not excited about this. And I also think it is way over priced .
If you drop your Surface this won't protect it like a otter box would. But over all I still like this case cover. I've had it for afew months now and have not noticed and issues such as the product breaking or cracking. Over all I am happy .
I bought this because I am willing to try anything once to help lose weight... As far as the whole weight loss since i have been taking thesee there hasn't been any, not even inches. But I do sleep SO much better at night! Soif you are having a hard time sleeping try this. But don't expect weight loss .
Not the best but okay to pass time. It should understand how your partner plays. It should have a better understanding of the game play .
I really like this item.What I didn't like was its chemical smell (formaldehyde or something).Also, it drains batteries (or perhaps that's just me .
I'd heard so many raves about its performance but I found no superstar.However, I think every woman should have one if she just wants to kick back and relax.This product requires a lot of manipulation .
Do not try to connect anything other than a PS3 or Xbox360 controller, like i did. I bought this intending to use a Logitech F310 controller with Xbox thinking than if it regularly works with PS3 than it must work with Xbox using this adapter, as it must convert any PS3 operating controller into a Xbox controller, right? Wrong .
THIS IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH THE BARNETT RC 150 CROSSBOW. IT SEEMS LIKE IT WOULD BE A GOOD SHOULDER STRAP, BUT I CANNOT USE IT .
This duvet set looks very good in the picture. However, the reality of it isn't the same.While it looks to be shades of brown - one of the prominent water-type markings is very black.  As well, one of the pillows is a very ugly green, which does not go with the set at all.Although I told the seller that I was returning the set as it was not as described - I was still required to return it at my OWN expense.  Then, 20% was deducted from my refund for a "restocking charge"?I lost money and time on this mechandise and I would recommed to anyone thinking of buying this duvet set or dealing with this vendor, to think twice .
do not run on this shoe it doesn't have good ancle support! it runs small on the size and is tight .
This book sounded like a real person. Was not too descriptive considering the title but was by no means dry .
Basically what I said in the title. You can make some shots with the same motion three times in a row. But on the next set it goes way wide on a simple passing shot. But it doesn't ruin the game. Good graphics. Good gameplay .
Not wide enough, often shifts and leaves room for leaks. Love the material, just wish it was larger and offered more coverage .
I truly love John Grisham's novels and would have given Summons a 4 up until the ending. I turned the page ready to continue and realized that the previous page was the end of the book. I chose the book because it had some of the same cast of characters and setting as A Time To Kill, Sycamore Row and The Last Juror, which were excellent. This book just didn't cut it .
I don't think I've used this product enough. I've only used it a couple times. The cream smells bad, the spray wasnt that bad. They both feel fine on the skin. With a couple more uses I believe I'll be able to say if this works .
Not good at all  afd ffddf fdfd dfdf dfdaf afdfsere sere arere adrer a erer ere erer er i don't want to waste my time .
This item is not bad, could be a little more rugged, it is easy over tighten and bust the end where the battery goes when you are replacing the batteries, the sound is not a clear as would liked .
This was better than expected, kids love singing to the music on the cd's some of them they don't know but I do .
These screen protectors are great fingerprints do not stay on the screen, it does not scratch, I have dropped the phone on the screen and there was not 1 scratch .
After trying the Dixson Bass Drum Lift and listening to two bass drums side by side, one with the Dixson Lift and one without, we decided to make the investment and distribute the Dixson Lift through out the United States. This simple but effective drum accessory will create a lower tone, deeper sound, or what ever you wish to call it. All we know is drummers try it, and smile, and that says it all!! You don't drill any holes and you don't scratch your beautiful hoop. Light weight and small it will slide right into your gig bag or leave it attached to your pedal. Try it and you will never play another gig without it .
The author has chosen to tackle not only an important subject, but an industry that is ripe with Docs who consider themselves just slightly higher than The Almighty. I recommend this book to anyone looking for an alternative to conventional medicine offered as the standard of care. The standard of care is not for everyone, especially those looking to treat the underlying problem and not the symptom. Nicely done Steve Harte .
too short. and the main character (the girl) is too vulnerable. I don't like that kind of personalities. he is too selfish .
The battery is not getting a full charge. Will not hold a full charge and the battery was only getting to 80 .
The system and hardwire is fine. I can't resist install Ubuntu on it as soon as I receive the package. In the era of touch-screen, the cost of this kind of traditional computers are lower and lower. A good example of high performance at low cost. I don't know whether it is made in China as Chinese products are increasingly better now. Last words, Far Cry 3 can run very well on this computer .
great cut, almost perfect, no bubble issues at all.  easy to install, if you can use some water it will be a lot easier .
works great with folder case... in order go have full nexus protection with the folder case.. buy this and use 2 cases.. because all the fold cases does not cover the corners... with this you are fully protected .
not magnetic on the the tablet. but its ok, im using right now POETIC slim and the keyboard externally, just in case i need to type a lot .
vivo smart is the best case ever seen, full windows 8.. protect it all the way with this case.  you will not regret if buy this case .
Nothing overwhelmingly amazing, but does provide a good amount of extra driving light.  We will see how they handle the frigid sub arctic temperatures of the Alaskan interior this winter .
Has worked as designed no issues.  Have used twice in some situations that put a good load on the product and have seen no sign of it wanting to come apart.  I am Happy .
Looks as though to be a quality product.  Form fit and function are all there and it bolted up nicely replacing the worn out hub/wheel bearings with no major issues.  Time will tell the true quality of the product (and if im bored one day may update) but for the price as of initial install and one day of driving I am very happy .
I've seen guys pay a lot more for covers that are not as thick and durable as this one. Bought this to cover my grizzly which has 27" tires and it covers it head to toe completely no problem!  Nice snug elastic around the bottom to ensure a good fit too. Very happy with purchase .
Cute, sturdy, and I get compliments for it all the time! Easy to use camera, too...no blockage. I highly recommend .
I love the item, and it does really makes difference on my skin color, i admit you won't get very light skin immediately, i am sorry if i only give 1 star at first, cause the first time i ordered, i didn't arrive at all. but considering by the products result, i am pretty happy .
Asus Nexus 7 is a excellent Tablet. its screen resolution, sound and performance are excellent, however I consider to the camera is not well .
Works great use it with my job.  Although I know the website does not work outside of my job.  T .
pretty awesome gun. I've had this gun for about a month now and nothing wrongs happened to it yet. Definitely would recommend  to all my friends .
This is 10x better than clash of clans. Easy to make money and not spend a penny! Very fun and enjoyable .
This CD is not just for babies!  It is so relaxing, soothing, and just makes you feel good.  And with &#34;The Voice&#34; of Linda Ronstadt, it just does not get any better!  Her voice is absolutely incomparable .
This is a great item to accelerate your workout program.  It is light weight and easy to take anywhere.  They come in different colors which represent various levels of resistance.  I purchased the blue, red and purple bands and use them accordingly.  Like another reviewer mentioned, use the door mount on the hinge side of the door only and then close to the hinge itself.  Otherwise, you might get a rude slap (as I did) when the pressure exerted by pulling on the bands expanded the door just enough to let the anchor slip through and hit me on the chest.  Lesson learned.  Never had that problem again and they work wonderfully.  I use mine with the 10 minute upper body workout and they are great.  I highly recommend using this to turn your room into a great upper body exercise space.Weight Loss Platinum Hypnosis Program .
Fantastic series full of wonderful characters, thoughtful situations and both light-hearted and touching moments. The series started strong unlike others that take time to develop.  This is in no small way due to the great acting and scripts.  Highly recommend all the seasons.  The final season that introduced new characters was also fascinating and enjoyable .
I really enjoy the size and feel of this Rider and it is great because it is heavy enough it doesn't come up when you do. My only issue is I will try to pose it in an upright position and it will not stay in place. It will slowly drift back towards the torso area .
The Satin Booty Shorts state that they are One Size and they are far from One Size! I usually wear a juniors size 7 or 9 and was unable to wear these shorts. They have very little give in the waist area and they had a very long crotch area making them very unflattering. I was very excited to get these shorts but was very disappointed in their fit, I have sent them back because I would never feel sexy wearing them .
Great outfit! Very pleased with this one! The outfit is made well and was priced right! The shipping is a little longer but definitely worth the wait. The skirt is very stretchy so it is definitely a one size fits all unlike some of the other outfits that I get and they should be sized as a 0 or 3! Can't wait to get naughty .
This toy looks very slick like it would feel like glass but is made of cheap plastic that was not completely sealed (had rough seams). After one use the light stopped working. It is a great size and I enjoyed that and the vibration but would not suggest to others .
Amazing sound( even when max volume) no distortion. very simple to set up and the wireless is impecable.Well done Sony .
Ordered 2 of these bags as I had used them before while deployed.  Both were purchased used and shipped to me overseas.  Both were shipped in heavy duty plastic vacuum sealed bags.  After unpacking they were as described, nearly new. No stains, rips, tears, smelled fresh and appeared to be brand new.  Extremely happy with the purchase and vendor service.  Would highly recommend to friends .
The phone case wasn't for me. It was for my little brother. Arrived on time and does everything he needs it to do. Protects his phone whenever he drops it and is pretty durable .
First thing you should know is that I'm one of the biggest skeptics out there. &#34;HANDS DOWN&#34;.. lol.. However, this product is absolutely positively amazing. A friend suggested it to me because of my chronic back pain, and the numbing and tingleness from a near fatal car accident i had back in 2010.  one month later, I decided to try it.. First thing I noticed is that my skin started clearing up from severe acne,(stress related) my face became brighter more even tone, and the glow is irresistable. Everyone started asking me did I start working out, I said no, with a puzzled look on my face.. Then I realized, it's the AminoSculpt that gave me the muscles without the gym... BONUS!!!!  In closing, it also aides me with falling asleep at bed time instead of all the meds they have me on for pain and sleep.. The only bad thing is, I'm not able to purchase it as often as I should. I'm off then on.. . But overall, it's a great product and I recommend it to my friends and family especially the ones with health issues.. I hope this helps someone out there.God Bless .
The company fulfilled and shipped my order within a matter of days.. I am very pleased with how quickly I received my order and not to mention how delicious the nuts were.. Just placed my second order tonight.. Can't wait for round 2 .
The print and binding are excellent and it ever retains that odd Japanese book store smell similar to bamboo and/or a tatami mat; however, the content contains mostly Toho and Daiei monsters from the 1970's.  Strangely, this book has a Godzilla paper cut out which would make it a good child's book.  Also, the latter third of the book is devoted to fan art which appears to be drawn by child.  A very curious book indeed, but not for any serious fan of past and present Dai Kaiju movies .
There are not too many fixtures that take the T6 Lamp, but if you got one, this is a inexpensive replacement; however, it's spectrum output is 2700K so be prepared for it to be a little more yellow than the 5000K Cool Whites .
If you're a child of the 70's and 80's, this DVD collection will bring back all your memories and at a price that your wife will not send you to the couch .
For those wanting the best of World Music, this CD and embedded video is a Must Buy.  Try it,...you will not be disappointed .
The set's appearance and surface detail are very handsome, but the clothe material is very light-weight and the adjustment straps do not keep vest fitted.  Still, with a little light alteration, it was just perfect for my son's junior prom .
Item appeared to be of acceptable manufacturing (from China) with batteries included; however, item would not function with the included batteries nor with fresh bought batteries.  I asked for a refund and received it.  Thanks Amazon .
My mother sang this to me, and now I can sing it to my monks. If you have never heard the rhyme, you cannot go wrong with this one .
It's a fun way to kill time. If you run out of game boosters I just go to the Plano room. You can refill and not make any purchases. It's great .
Crossword puzzles get boring after a bit, over and over repeats. Nit to mention it never changes. Down, across. This gives a different level of difficulty. From my children to my parents mind boggling fun (4-68 .
I enjoy this game more then Candy Crush and I don't feel I need to spend money to advance levels. It's an option not needed .
Shipped in a good time in great packaging and the product was in great shape and works perfectly couldn't ask for more .
i was unsatisfied, didn't fit my phone. disapointed but it was very cheap priced so its not a big deal .
I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend and I thought he was going to cry when he opened it (no worries, he didn't actually cry). He now plays it in loop in his apartment...a great man gift .
my pump is used today and works hard does a superior job no problems and it's cold here and the pool is closed rain needs pumping .
the f fret is hard to hold and the rest of the things are alright there were no return slip .
I was hiking in the mountains outside of Elektro, and I began to get hungry. I had many cans in my green mountain pack, but nothing to open them with (I wasn't going to shoot them open). As I was looting houses I came across one of these bad boys. It opened all of my cans and dispatched some zombies along the way. I have never been hungry since .
I bought this thinking that it would be the real constitution... I was wrong. Still great quality and very convincing, but I checked it and there is no secret writing like Nicholas Cage promised .
Best product ever!!!  Especially the Apple Cinnamon.  They used to sell it in a vitamin outlet close to where I live, but they stopped so now I have to get it online.  They still sell vanilla, but I don't care for it.  I had a severe traumatic brain injury and it seems like Alive is the only product that I have ever found that keeps my blood sugar level stable.  It is my breakfast and keeps me satiated most of the day .
Not sure why they took this off the market.  I absolutely loved Honey/Beige as the Natural Beige/cool is too white looking.  I live in Florida and have more of a tan.  Always had compliments that I looked younger....I'm 44 and people would say they thought I was in my 30's .
Love this product, especially the curved brush and the fact it is rich Black.  No complaints regarding this product that I always use .
I suffered a Severe Traumatic Brain Injury in 1997 and was in a coma for almost two weeks.  They saw the damage in the frontal lobe of my brain, but I think something else was injured (like my pituitary).  I saw a nutritionist and she started me on this.  I prefer natural remedies to drugs even though I have to use both.  This is just one of the three things she had me on from metagenics.  Together they seem to help my mood and my hormones and regulate my cycle more.  Now I am on disability and have a very difficult time affording these products.  They are priced high because they work.  I'm not sure this can help anyone else as my situation is the result of a severe brain injury....Love the product, but keep praying for the price to go lower for me.... Kerry .
I paid for the Action Replay DS, and I got it. But the problem is, it's one of the early versions of it and it was shipped to me with no AR CD/cord to quickly add games and cheat codes to my Action Replay DS; which means I have to insert everything manually with my DS touch screen's crappy keyboard.It can perform all the cheats Codejunkies has to offer, but if it's not pre-set, be prepared to spend a hell of a long time typing in each code .
Provides great protection, doesn't make the iPhone feel too bulky or big, lightweight rubber case.The only issue I found (and I mean the &#34;only&#34; part) was that at the bottom, where you plug in the charger, there is a line of rubber in between each of the speakers and the actual plug-in hole, making it very hard/uncomfortable to plug it in and practically impossible with some of the bigger cords (like the one I use in my car to charge it or connect it to the car's speakers). However, once I cut these off (any kind of small knife will do it, it doesn't need to be sharp at all) the case worked perfectly with any kind of charging/linking device and I am very satisfied with it .
No different than the ones a 3ds comes with, other than the color on the ends. They stretch out to the same length and fit nicely inside the console's socket .
this is a fun app that anyone can use. its great for the kindle fire hd ! and its free you can't beat that .
This products doesn't work at all.  Waste of money.  Never buy this products.  Disappointed with this products. a a a .
Wrong products.  Didn't feet to my car.  Too heavy to return the products.  I reordered break parts from Autozone.  No problem .
This products is not polarized lens.  Too much difference with original.  Waste of money.  Never buy this products.  Disappointed with this products .
The otter box was in horrible condition.  The rubber was not right in it, the screen protected was scratched all up.  The camp pattern on the back began peeling off immediately.  I would have returned the junk but I can't find it so I'll just have to settle for not ordering anything from you again .
The picture makes this box look big but its very small couldn't hold half of the make up I have! I ended up giving mine to my little cousin. If you don't have much makeup this is for you but if you have a lot I would recommend you get something else .
This battery is fake it would not hold a charge! It swelled up and would fit in my Note anymore! This is a piece of crap!!! Don't buy this .
One of my favorite cases for my note. Its pretty fits my phone perfectly. Its light and not heavy. Come in good timing and its pink I love it .
Besides the fact that it pink and pretty it is also very protective and every time I drop my phone this case never comes off and my phone is never broken. My phone still looks like new thanks to this case .
They would not stick with any glue this was a total waste of money! Hate these tips! Do not order them .
This screen protector was a plus it didn't have a lot of air bubbles and I loved that nobody could see who I was texting or what I was doing on my phone unless they got really close .
With these lashes you do get what you pay for! THEY DONT STICK ULESS YOU USE A LOT OF GLUE! They took a month to come and the box was damaged when I got them the lashes don't lay right I hate this product .
I got these in sliver and gold I love them both! The gold has not changed colors every time I wear them people compliment me on how pretty they are! And I love the pearl bracelet that's my favorite part of the set .
I over love these bracelets they are so freaking cute I am a pearl head so it was a plus to see the pearl bracelet and I love to wear a lot of bracelets at once! They don't turn colors like most fake jewelry and they have lasted me pretty long I got them three months ago .
I loved these earrings but they ended up breaking for no apparent reason I couldn't fix them. I had just gotten them. but I would recommend to anyone who likes them they look just like the picture and they came a couple days after I ordered them .
Well I am a lipstick lover I try all kinds from MAC to the colors at the beauty supply store I just love lipstick. But these I didn't like they smell funny and don't last throughout the day the colors don't show up as well as I would like. I threw mine in the trash .
I love this case they don't make many good cases for my Note that's cute and protects my phone. This is why I love this case because it protects my phone and its different. It was delivered before the delivery date also! I am very pleased .
Book. Arrived in good order and very quickly. My only disappointment was the postage and handling black plastic bag stapled and that cost me over 10.00. When the book weighed no more than 150gms. Was willing to pay because present for someone who had been looking for this book for a long while. Don't know that I would do it again would rather pay more for book .
I tried local auto parts stores with no luck. I replaced my auto antenna which is mounted on the rear fender. There was no way I wanted route the current cable and this adapter allows you to connect the antenna to the existing cable .
I have not seen a Pixar movie yet I have not liked, but this is one of the best. We saw this at the movies but I waited until the price came down a bit before adding to our library .
I have been using this for about 3 months and it is holding up well. Some do not like the velcro vs. a magnetic closing mechanism, but I am happy with the product .
I used it less than a month when one belt loop detached from the back of the case. This was not worth the trouble of ordering .
Couldn't ask for more its been a big help in understanding the reasons for the concepts of calculus. You will pass if you buy it .
I ordered this, focusing on the better review rather than the negative ones, and boy was I wrong to do so. I am very disappointed. The way the description was phrased, made it seem like it would work for both the DC and AC plugs, but upon arrival I realized that was not the case. Then, I had to wait three days for the converter to come. Finally, when I tried to use it, after 30 minutes it didn't even get a little warm. Also, the timer on it was extremely loud and obnoxious. I could hardly hear my TV. Can't even imagine trying to sleep with that clicking. All in all, do not buy this product, unless you just want a stiff camo blanket .
I have had every cologne from armani code to drakkar and I have never had my girlfriend ask me to use it cause she liked the smell. It's a unique smell and definitely not for the truck driver type, or the conservative type, it's for the sporty, athletic type, someone unique willing to stand out...In a good way, it's definitely different, but ladies like it but don't use too much a spray or two will do .
It's not a bad case for the price but it has the look more of a binder than a tablet case, oh and the card holders on the otherside will fit a business card and not a drivers license or credit card .
This case is top of the line you can't beat it, the only drawback is its kind of hard to push the buttons because of the clear protective screen cover. It's a 10 for this case in all fields, protection, looks, and everything else you grade cases on .
This case is just as good if not better than an otterbox. This case provides all the protection you could ask for and more, for the price its without a doubt the best case for the money .
Oakleys are also well known name but honestly I was kind of disappointed with the quality of the frames the definitely feel like they could break easily if your not careful. It's the lens you pay for without a doubt but they could've made the frames feel a little less plasticy and cheap feel. But there Oakleys its the name your buying an expensive name at that .
Of all the cases I have gotten all the reviews I read on this case, this case was the most disappointing. I didn't feel there was adequate protection with this case for the same price you could get a much more durable case, one that provides more defense against falls or drops. It's got two layers of the flimpsy rubber stuff. I might look cool and if that's what your looking for than this is your case, otherwise shop around go otterbox or a few others that's are just as awesome .
The case is great and stands right next to the otterboxes, the only thing is that it is quite a task getting it on but for protection it shouldn't just clip on. 10 in my book .
The cover is not bad it's not the most effective case you could buy. It's more for show and use it for that purpose only .
As long as its under 40$ it's a good deal and a overall warm and appealing fleece, would by again, in a different color but not for anymore than 40.00 .
It's a good all around case but i did not like the big plastic feel and look. It didn't feel like it would protect well against falls or drops...I mean it's plastic, but don't drop it and you will be fine .
Chrome Dreams is the 1977 unreleased album by Neil Young. The CD features a large amount of still-unreleased material.The version of "Powderfinger" is the original acoustic version. The title "Too Far Gone" would not see release until 1989's Freedom. It is presented on Chrome Dreams with Crazy Horse's Frank "Poncho" Sampedro accompanying Young on a 1917 mandolin. "Stringman", a piano ballad, was written for Jack Nitzsche and is presented as a performance from Young's 1976 European tour. Eighteen years later, Young revived "Stringman" forUnplugged [VHS] having never released it as a studio track.Side one"Pocahontas" - 3:24"Will to Love" - 7:11"Star of Bethlehem" - 2:42"Like a Hurricane" - 8:14"Too Far Gone" - 2:41Side two"Hold Back the Tears" - 5:16"Homegrown" - 2:20"Captain Kennedy" - 2:55"Stringman" - 3:32"Sedan Delivery" - 5:22"Powderfinger" - 3:23"Look Out for My Love" - 4:06 .
After reading this book, I felt empowered! Reading one heart wrenching journey after another made me realize that even in our darkest hours, our family isn't alone in the fight to recover our daughter from the group of illnesses they diagnosed as autism. This book should not only be required reading for anyone who loves a child or adult with autism, but someone who is pregnant or planning on starting a family. NOONE is buying the better diagnosis excuse that the CDC keeps trying to sell. Our children with autism are medically sick and they can get better with the right interventions .
Great case works well, the only problem you might have with it is that it can be hard to take off, once you put it on. But if you keep the pry tool it is not a problem. Kickstand feels a little flimsy, but I've had no problems with it(I open and shut it all day long). Also it comes in a lot of colors schemes .
This 2 pounds of chocolate was sent to me in a box about an inch bigger then the chocolate with no packing to keep it from melting , so needless to say I have 2 pounds of a brick of melted chocolate in the refridgerator.  I suppose I could slice it up but it was a gift .
I had other faux wooden blinds up before these for years until they broke and I needed to replace them.  These have no image of wood on them and they look like smooth cheap plastic also I couldn't tell by the picture even enlarged that there was no wand to open and close them.  I don't care for all the string pulls .
sucks when you ahve to walk out to the front desk in a swimsuit and towel and ask for bolt-cutters because your lock won't open.  To be fair, it did last 4 months before it wouldn't open..bought it at Home Depot, and now searching for another lock .
Ray Price went on to have hit after hit. Although I know of his older songs, and like Release Me (he was the first to make it a hit), and Crazy Arms, I was most impressed with the sixties songs he did like: Night Life and For The Good Times. Singers like Ray Price, and all the other greats of their times, didn't have to have all the flashing lights, and other distractions, to keep the attention on them; they stood alone, with just their voice and music.; that was all Ray Price needed to be at the top .
Jackson should be a lesson for a lot of the new 'so called country signer'. I don't know where the others get the ideas we want to see the same ol' type of videos over and over; i.e. the four wheel trucks, the parties, the flashes of how many one second photos can we show, in one of the same type, of over and over videos Jackson has kept his 'cowboy' hat, and not reverted to the ball cap on backwards. It's good to have some of the 'real country' still left, like Alan Jackson .
I can't at this time think of the names of all the songs by Waylon I like, but there are many. I like the few I bought on Amazon, but my favorite of the three is, Anita, You're Dreaming. He was one of the greatest; his singing buddies knew that too .
The only reason I didn't give a five was because it gave the impression that Hank was only married once. From what I understand he was married a second time and I feel it was an insult to his second wife that she was not included in this movie. I understand it gave a better ending the way it was done, but when watching a so called true to life story, that is what I want it to be; not just another of those Hollywood jerks changing things the way they want. Still I had seen this movie two times before and wanted it in my collection along with Jerry, Elvis, Holly, Richie, Cold miner's daughter and others .
Must have for breast feeding. Positions baby perfectly and saves mom from back pain. Don't waste your money on anything else .
I was a big fan of Power Rangers in the late 90s-early 00s, and I never had the original MMPR Megazord. Thankfully, this rerelease fills that void. Although not a perfect recreation of the 90s toy, it still has a vintage feel. Parts are of high-quality plastic and diecast. My only complaint is the sticker sheet. The actual stickers are placed about a half-inch to the right of the patterns (most likely a manufacturing error, and hopefully an isolated incident). Overall, this is a must-have for fans of the show from way back when .
Kind of boring. Wish there was more to it. Clues would be nice or a timer.Could be better.Doesn't take incubation power .
I would have loved the product pictured but that is not what I received. Please send me the product pictured which is the product I paid for .
TOTAL waste of money to buy this product. It's very cheap and doesn't seem to work well on ANY device!! DO NOT PURCHASE .
I bought 2 of those books and they are awesome but they were stick together with a big sticker and I haven't succeed to take it away completely without damaging the cover of the product .
took forever for this to come and it almost didn't come before I needed it for my daughters first birthday party...and when I got it I busted out laughing as it is very tiny like maybe 1.5 inches across the widest piece of the thing .
I purchased this wallet as a Christmas gift for my fiance' and he absolutely loves it. Just the right amount of storage space and durable, good quality. Sits nicely in his back pocket too- not to bulky .
The pie dish is a little big when i saw it the first time. Because of the size I didn't use it to make pies. Instead, I've used it to make baked shrimp and roast chicken! So far so good. The color is pretty too!*****I feel that the dotted rim makes it a little hard to clean after roasting chicken in it**** My solution is to put aluminum foil around the rim PRIOR to putting anything in the pan. This way when it's time to clean up, simply remove the foil and then u don't have to do any work on the rim!Side note, stoneware cools down much faster than cast iron. So don't expect your food to remain hot 30 min after it's out of the oven. I have a le creuset cast iron and food remains hot after an hour outside the oven .
I used this to clean my tiffany silver jewelries. I dipped the ring in, waited for couple seconds, and take it out. It shines like new!Before I bought it, I saw some reviews mentioning the strong smell of the solution. I agree with the strong odor. However, my jewelry did NOT smell anything after I take it out! So I think it's more important for the jewelries to not have any smell. five stars .
This costume is so cute. It actually looks like the picture. If your rough with clothes this might not be for you because it's not delicate, but it's not too tough either so if you pull on it too hard it will rip. The medium fit me perfectly and I'm about 5'2". It also comes with everything it says it does. I absolutely adore it .
I would definitely order from this company again. The product arrived before expected which was great, and it was well made. It also gives full protection of the Ipod and is really soft which is awesome. Personally I love it! The only warning I could give is that one the bow wasn't blue it was like a purple (but it was still cute) and two it was a little bit big for the Ipod especially around the button on the top of the ipod. I wish there were more cases like this one for the Ipod .
Should have listened to one of the reviews. Shoe is just very largely made esp around the ankles. Your feet will slip through as it has no grips and the strip on top of foot is SUPER loose.Such a waste and a big regret .
The sound and picture were everything I loved about the tv. Then after playing for 45 mins. the picture ect. went off and it will not work at all.  I charged it for hours and, it still will not come on.  I will be sending it backtho for a replacement .
This book seemed to start off good...but I just had a real problem with the characters. The sex scenes were just as good as book one...if not better.  It was something with those characters that I just didn't like this time around.  Once I got  in I read the last chapter because I didn't want to invest too much time into these characters.  While it was OK...it had the potential to be so much better.  I think Book II was the darker version of the, oh so sweet Book I .
This was the best book I have read in a long time.  It was definitely filled with a lot of sex scenes some more detailed than others - but they were all great.  I really liked Rich, Vanessa, and Candy's relationship.  It was a little to Unbelievable at times...but that's what fiction is!  I loved it and can't wait for part two to arrive .
Marketed as XL barely fit over the work boot of a men's size 9. Definitely not as easy on/off process for going in & out of customers' homes. Will not be purchasing again .
Only order our paper from this company. Not only is the paper of good quality and inexpensive, but the turn around time is just a couple days. (Very helpful when estimators don't mention that paper is low, only when it's gone .
If you like heart racing, tense, can't put it down kind of books you will love this! I started reading and immediately I knew I wasn't getting much work done until I finished through the book, it was too good. It had me on the edge of my seat, biting my nails one minute, laughing out loud the next, and crying another.I  love that the book brings up the point that sex trafficking isn't something that simply happens in a foreign country, it's something that happens every day in the United States, and in places you think it might not happen.Being a full time student, working full time and having a family, I don't get a lot of time to read, however over the summer I will be reading the rest of the Pastor Butch (main character) books .
Amazon prime offers this video for free for viewing on PC and I have been wanting to get in shape so I took advantage of the free aspect of it!I am NOT in shape, a good 100+ pounds overweight, I don't go on walks, I dont do anything to get me moving through the day so I was scared to start in on Jillian but I am glad I did. This is great for beginners. There were some things I couldn't do, but I just kept moving with some of the warm ups/easier exercises while they did the ones I couldn't do. I got through 17 minutes before I had to call it quits, which may not be great for those experienced in working out, but for the first time working out since gym in high school, I felt AWESOME and felt very accomplished getting through nearly half of it! I cant wait to see how long I can go tomorrow .
When you buy the larger sized pants, you can expect the legs to be as wide as the thighs. My legs are much thinner than my thighs, and it makes the legs look very baggy. Doesn't matter though, a needle and thread can fix that .
Listen... I've owned over ten headsets besides this one since I initially purchased this one a while back. It has survived most of my 4 year old's life span and he has abused it more than the a public toilet at a buffet during half price hour. I now have a daughter and I have no doubt it will survive her as well.Buy one, and have it in case you are like me and blow through head sets for stupid reasons all the time .
No matter what you think it is worth buying this mouse just to look at it. I love the mouse, and playing games like League of Legends is much easier with it .
Pros:Its comfortablelooks goodThe sound quality is good when its working.Cons:The audio jack had to be twisted to make a good connection in several of my devices. It is apparent that it doesn't work well.The microphone jack simply doesn't work. it worked for about three minutes then became unusable. My friends and my tests have shown that when plugged in they cannot hear me, instead they hear a banshee giving birth to conjoined twins.I have serious doubts that there is an actual microphone in the headset, because the sound control also has what appears to be an inline microphone. That sounds like false advertising to me, but I'd have to take it apart to find out.I will update this after I take it apart, because if it is only cosmetic I don't need it there.In the end I think this headset was a bad attempt at a good design .

GREAT MUSICAL TOY FOR BABY TO HOLD AND LISTEN TO.MUSIC NOT TOO LOUD AND EASY TO HOLD ON TOO .
Bought this toy for my 2 year old grand daughter and she really loves it!!!walks around all day with the picnic basket and plays feeding her dolls etc with all the cuos, cuttlery ,bread and cheese.She also loves the music and songs.just right size pieces to have  if you  a have younger baby sister around.not dangerous.Great toy and not expensive at all for what it is.thank you .
I was skeptical when I first ordered this product because I thought that they were expensive for only getting 12 small blocks. However, the price is definitely worth it. The small size of the blocks is perfect for their little hands, but not too small where she has the potential to choke on them.I LOVE all the HABA products that I own because they are safe for my LO to put in her mouth (wooden blocks with non-toxic paint). The majority of my daughter's favorite toys are HABA products .
Just because someone puts a &#34;W&#34; on the tag, doesn't make it a wide shoe. I wear a wide New Balance shoe, and have even had my foot measured at a New Balance store, so I know how this should fit. I love the look of the shoe, but unfortunately that doesn't help make it comfortable .
I have this book on my Android.  It is easier to carry with me wherever I go. Not only that,  it is easier to see.  This author is great.  He has written on a number of fantastic Christian topics from the Bible.  Anyone who loves history will love this book.  It will really stir up a hunger for more information on Biblical times .
This dictionary is not only fun to use,  but has great purpose. It certainly is not bulky.  LOL.  It is an e-book. It can be used anywhere.  Try it.  You  will like it .
Came really fast. looks never use. in a original box, My mother is going to freak , she has been waiting one forever.. Use BUT looks like new!! Thanks .
I ordered this because my little brother wanted a TALKING tepig and instead got a normal plushie without the thing that makes it able to talk!!! So now my crybaby of a brother is crying because the stupid thing won't talk!!!!! I thought it said it was a TALKING TEPIG .
I will be purchasing more Nannette clothing. This 3 piece outfit is extremely soft, warm, ridiculously cute, and also extremely cool looking. I can't wait for my little rockstar to open this on Christmas. He usually does not care about opening clothes being only 3 but I just know he will love this hat. I absolutely suggest any of their clothing as a must purchase .
It was good reading this again, refreshing the concept that we need to be independent and individuals. That the power of the I must not be diminished and subverted by the "we." Living our lives as we choose, not how the majority want us to live. Enjoy this short novella .
is a very good iron, your hair look beautiful and in just one pass!, does not hurt the hair! It is all I can say .
I really enjoyed this book. It's creative, fabulous, magic and I identified me with this book!Also it inspired me to do things and fight for my dreams and never surrender .
I recommend this book for everybody! It's worth to read itIt's no easy learn another language, but either impossible one just need discipline, commitment, and value to go ahead and get it.The Second Edition is very good. I am glad to have read the Second Edition, because I was going to invest more money in the academy, but I realized that I need more practice with my English. I need a job where I have to speak English,  and a Social English Circle to improve it. No more grammar nor boring books. I need to speak a lot to get more confidence and pass to another level.Thank You Daniel .
I am so happy with this story, it is fantastic, creative and it's not predictable. I liked how the writer developed the story and described the all details. It was very interesting that up to I felt scared when I was reading the book! Nobody does that! Awesome. Congratulations Mr Nicholas you are the best .
I've red behind the sun and girl of shadows in the last 3 weeks and now can't wait to get my hands on the silk thief,only it won't be out till nearly xmas,I'm sure it will be worth waiting for.I love Deborah's stories .
The kick stand on the back of the case doesn't work. you can open it and set it down but it snaps closed almost immediately .
I'm very disappointed with the purchase.Absolutely doesn't fit to ANY item we have. Wouldn't recommend it to any one .
Pros: Does what it's made for. Protects the the phone from drops,dirt,car oil, ect. Adds thickness to the phone so that you can hold it better. Does not fall out of your pocket.Cons: Flash on can cause a green hue in pictures during the day (if flash is on), an at night you can't take any pictures without green over coming the whole picture.Should you get it: It's up to you, because it may or may not happen to you. If do get this type of case get the all black one .
I chose this rating because it was the highest the site allowed. This book was the first that I have read by this author, but it will not be the last. I completed the entire book in less than an hour and a half. I couldn't put it down .
we look forward to each episode, and buy them as soon as they come out. Never have to worry about what the content will be, we only have to worry about our 150lb bull mastiff jumping on us because we are laughing so hard. He wants in on the fun...I did have him worried when I was crying from laughing at bumblebees tuna, but I think even the dog found that episode hysterical .
The CRL Door Pressure Gauge performed perfectly.  It's well designed, compact and so simple to use anyone using it for the first time should have no problems figuring out how to use it.  The price was right and I'd recommend it to anyone who's trying to meet ADA compliance door pressure requirements .
Device was good but the power cord was broken so I had to order a new one and a month later I still have not recieved it. waiting on deliverly.Lino Alcala .
I recently purchased a head unit for my car, and was excited to get a stereo back into it, as I had not had a car for about 5 years while I was in college, and really missed the years of owning car and having a nice stereo with a sub. It was like my rolling sanctuary, and I wanted that back. I ended up getting a 12" L5 solobaric sub, based on the praise it got, and the apparent hype surrounding it. The price of the sub fooled me into thinking that it MUST be good. I thought I lucked out getting the sub and a custom ported box for $200.00 on craigslist. The box was huge and built very well. I hooked it up to the cheapo 1200 watt Sound Xtreme amp I had laying around, and was immediatley dissapointed. The bass was just not at all what I was hoping it would be, or would be able to tolerate very long. It was incredibly boomy. It missed many notes in my rock music, as well as a solid portion of my hip hop. For my bassnectar and similar music it rocked. It absolutely pounded. But in the end, it was really only great with that 1 type of music. Playing with the amp and adjusting the gain was pointless, as even on very low settings, it was just wayy too much.  The bass was much too loud for various songs. Some songs sounded fine, some sounded like crud, and some just sounded OFF, wayy to much bass at wrong times, and the sub was unable to fully reproduce all of the different frequencies my music required of it. I did much research over the next few days. Trying to determine how I could get the sound I was after. I read lots of different opinions, wildly different from the next. The worst part was that the people advising all seemed fairly credible, and trustworthy. Yet they all offered different advice, none of which panned out. In the end, I listened to my gut, and decided to purchase a new sub. This time, a round 12", or possibly a 10", and also this time, a sealed box. Ported boxes just don't cut it for me. They don't deliver that tight accurate bass that I absolutely crave.I spent about 1.5 weeks scouring the web, reading, comparing prices, listening to advice. I decided in the end that I would suck it up, and buy something that pretty much guaranteed me the results I was after. A JL audio 12" sub, (12w3 or better) and a sealed box. I was just about to order those 2 things, for the price of about 230.00 after shipping. While I was adding the item to my cart, checking one last time that I had the right sub with the right specs, I accidently clicked a link for the Infinity 1262w. I immeditley realized I had totally forgotten about this company. And I reminisced about my first sub, a 10" infinity, and how lovely it sounded, and how long it lasted. I saw the price was only $65.00 so immeditley I assumed this was low end gear, and that maybe this was infinity's budget line, on par with the likes of Sony, or Walmart Pioneer subs. Just for giggles,  I decided to check out the reviews, and see what people thought... at 4.5 stars, they must have been pleased. What I found shocked me. The reviews were so overwhelmingly positive, so I set out to find any and all discussion or literature about this sub. Each thing I found was better than the last. Outrageous claims about this sub blowing away top end $200.00 - $400.00 subs. On a handful of occasions, people compared this sub to the JL 10w7,time after time they seemed to favor the 1262w. Instead of being called out as being full of it, they were consistently backed up, and multiple people genuinely agreed. I simply couldn't believe it.I had free 2 day shipping, and 40 bucks in amazon credit, so I said what the heck, and decided to take the chance. I picked up this sub and the reccomended 1.25 cu foot scosche box for $95.00 shipped 2 day air. I hooked this sub up to my same cheapo amp, and wired it to use both voice coils, and I believe it is running @ 2 ohm. IT SLAMS. All music. Any genre. It sounds so amazing, I am absolutely stunned. It gave me exactly what I wanted, and also manged to give me even more than I was hoping for.TL;DR - Just because this sub is $65.00 does not mean it has sacrificed quality for the sake of affordability. Somehow, infinity manages to consistently put out extremely high quality products, and a cost that is not just affordable, but almost discouragingly cheap. I don't get it. I don't know how they do it. I don't understand how there is sooo much crap out there... Countless brands who have become irrelevant over the years for following the same path. The path to Walmart. Sacrificing quality every time in order to be cheap enough to sell mass quantities. Well, let me assure you, Infinity does not have the same problem, and seems to be the only company in the entire Car Audio game that will not succumb to that fate. Long Live Infinity .
i am very hard on phones. i have cracked screens, broken backlights, and demolished other &#34;protective&#34; cases.yes, this makes my phone much bulkier, but that is not an issue for me.it is protected, and that is what i needed .
Absolutely fantastic. Should make every one stop and pray for salvation.  I don't want to be left behind. Thank you JESUS FOR SAVING MY LIFE .
This baby crib sheet is slick and feels cheap.  It's not soft like cotton.  Very thin.  I should have paid more attention to the description .
Fits well in my crib. Gray color matches perfectly with my pottery barn Harrison bed skirt. I didn't want to spend that much at pottery barn for a bumper and this was is perfect .
Not really what I was expecting.The filing is not thick enough and doesn't stay where needed. Will use but not real happy with it .
Reading Lance Larsen's poetry in "Erasable Walls" was a refreshing experience especially due to the current literary world being dominated by criticism and novels. Poetry is somewhat of a dying art however Lance Larsen seems to resurrect it through his vivid work. From start to finish, each poem drew me in and allowed me to see the world through a variety of perceptions. In poems like "Lips", it's interesting how Larsen focuses on a child's perception of adults and how the details he notices are tied to the superficiality of his mother. With descriptive language like a "smeared" mouth and "wet looking and waxy" appearance Larsen allows us to step into this child's world and a little bit into our own past. In addition to this, Larsen also illustrates the requirement of children to grow up quickly sometimes, applying adult lenses to the perceptions he creates. In "Lips" near the end of the poem he does this, the child describing the numerous duties and errands of his mother and then saying, "I wanted to save all that, and her." In "February 1922: My Father's Conception" the perception is reversed, an older man reflecting upon youth. As the older man sees two names chalked into a driveway (presumably done by children) he reflects "names mapping the erasable walls of the heart." It is this kind of in depth imagery that Larsen employs that causes his readers to not only recognize his good writing, but cause them also to reflect upon greater issues and themes throughout life. This play-on-perception is a wonderful tool that Larsen uses that really captivated me and caused me to think about the power of perception and how perception can change reality. The poetry in this book was wonderful and if anyone is truly a fan of poetry, then they shall truly enjoy the work within this book .
i didn't actually &#34;need&#34; the strategy guid as ive played and have found everything in the game and i've done it all as well. but i had to have it because i wanted it .
it's good, but it's not for everyone. the game has some annoying dubbing, granted they are just as annoying in japanese as well, o well that is what we get for asking dual audio, the english version always turns out shit .
no turn based battles, no whiney emo teenagers, and no spiky hair.while most JRPG's are content to simply be set in a fantasy land, yakuza breaks the mold as it is set in modern day japan. Yakuza is a great JRPG that avoids typical JRPG tropes like its the plague, as well as being realistic. set in the red light district of japan (i believe its somewhere in shinjuku or is shinjuku just renamed) called kamurocho, where yakuza reign and the police are corrupt. if you haven't played the first three you should leave this page now and buy them now before you even think about purchasing this game. Yakuza has a lot of content packed in the small town you explore, so much content it may take you several play throughs to experience it all, i have played every yakuza game several time over and i'm STILL finding lots of goodies to enjoy. this is a game that you want to take you time and simply enjoy. the only problem a lot of player will have is the sheer amount of cut scenes, although well done, it can take away from the experience because they tend to drag on for obscene amounts of time. if you thought the amount of cut scenes in MGS4 was ridiculous, this game will put you off. another thing is the fact that each game is set in the exact same place so it can feel a little old after a while, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing. the money and time saved on world building is given to create new areas, like the roof tops and underground areas of yakuza 4, as well as new mini games, side quests and new small details added to the environments themselves. but if you can over look the flaws, you will find a great game that has a very rich and gratifying experience, on par with the likes of skyrim, it may not be as long or as deep as skyrim, but it is certainly the JRPG equivalent to the experience that skyrim provides while being decidedly japanese at the same time .
I've had trouble with acne since my freshman year of high school. Over the years I've tried many different tricks and products, and not a single one has had such a stunning and prompt effect as Clearzine. I am very pleased with this product and intend on buying more. The product shipped very swiftly and I have no complaints whatsoever .
When she was younger, my daughter refused to sleep in deep cribs, so I bought the travel bed before I went oversee to visit family.The bed survives the travels well. Easy to fold and unfold, easy to carry and very comfortable. We took it to grandparents, to road trips, and sometimes just for living-room sleeping.Be warn, though - it is light weight, so when the baby starts crawling - it is time to store the bed for the next one. :-)Also: we always put it low - floor, carpet, mattresses - never where it might tip and fall .
The quality of this cube is not really good, but what are you going to expect for the price, just fine if it is your first 2x2. I like it, but I think it could be better .
This Item was not what the seller had described at all!!!! They said it was flat and spiral steel boned but it is not!! the busk is the only thing that is steel and that is it other then that it is a regular plastic boned satin corset. I brought this item thinking it was what the seller described it as even though I saw I was not going to be able to return it. I am very disappointed with the order.  I would not recommend getting this unless it was like 15 dollars or less .
This Item has everything you need! And the price is not bad its great for the quality of everthing you get .
This was such a cute outfit the jacket was adorable but the flower I was expecting to be on it was not there when it arrived. But I still love it. The shirt is cute. But the pants are not what they seem to be in the picture. I ordered for a 12 month old and the pants look like they should be for an 18 month almost 2 yr old. Other then the flower not being there and the jeans it's aborable .
Very good...love John Grisham!!!! So riveting,couldn't put it down,wanted to read more,can't wait to buy his next book ...would definitely recommend this book to anyone who loves John Grisham .
Shins with an new electric sound...it works 100%. Couldn't stop listening to it the first 3 days i got it .
Sunday morning lounging and drive music if i have ever heard it. Makes me wonder why it never became popular in the States. A true British invasion of dreamy attitude and super sounds .
Wow! I have searched high and low and finally found my printer cartridges at Office Depot-- paid $72 for 5 cartridges.  Depressing!Determined not to pay Office Depot prices again, I found Blake's on Amazon-- WHAT A VALUE. I purchased 10 cartridges for a fraction of what I paid at Office Depot, and they are exactly what I need.  Fast shipping too-- even at Christmas time. Thanks Blake Priting Supply .
A bit slow in places didn't grab me early enough. When I persevered it picked up and was in the end a good story .
It was the usual Belinda Alexandra, I can't put down book. I had to keep reading to see what happened next. I have read all her novels released here and can't wait for the next. My favourite was Golden Earrings .
Was not as useful as i thought it would be. Maybe will be more useful as we all get used to it and find out more. We don't use Facebook etc .
This cleansing conditioner is amazing. My whole life I've had straight, no body hair. After using Wen, I actually have curls! I think it's because there is nothing weighing my hair down. I am totally hooked on Wen .
A fantastic looking watch that is nicely weighted. its not too light like some other cheaper watches.If your thinking about buying this watch go ahead as you won't be dissapointed.  I have had many comments on the watch, one workmate asked if it was a Rolex as it looks that good.Like other comments, the face is slightly darker than shown but I prefer that as it looks more sofisticated.  But to be honest most US based on-line web sites seem to be over brightning adverts these days.Thanks Bulova .
I have only had mine a week but getting plenty of questions, and best of all is the price.A quality watch that also looks the part.  This gives some of my TAG's a run for their money in the show stakes.If your thinking of buying one you won't be disappointed.Oh, doing up the band is surely an IQ test, eventually I passed though.Cheers .
This book radically changed my approach and understanding to generosity. For myself, this has been one of the woefully neglected areas of my ministry. I was one of those guys described in the book who felt it was a mark of holiness for me not to know who gives and really be completed ignorant of what was going on financially. After reading the book, I simply looked at stewardship/generosity in a new light. I am taking my leadership through the book and will be making sure that the concepts and principles therein will find their way throughout the church .
Searcy's book, &#34;Connect&#34; is a good book and I really enjoyed it, for the simple reason it enabled me to start thinking through how to create and implement systems in our church. What I like about it is that its very practical. While not everything translates to our context, I always make sure I look for principles of connection not programs. And very often with Searcy, what you see is simply common sense put to print helping us remove much of the fear of recruiting and implementing volunteers .
While using it the first week it broke.  We were able to take it apart and fix the wire that came off.  The cats do love it though, it's better when you get it still and move it yourself because the cats like it better that way.  I would have given it 5 stars if it hadn't broke because the cats do love it .
Be careful with these pants, they DO NOT follow amazons sizing chart. If you order a large you will not get a 30 - 32 waist, you will get a 40 waist .
This is a really great knife, as long as you know a good, experienced knife sharpener.Pros -This is a really solid knife all around, great handle, great balance and feel, not too heavy not too light, and comes with a nice sheath. Feels very durable and is very comforting to have while in the backyard at night.Cons -This knife came to me not as sharp as i would expect from Ka-Bar. It's sharp enough for daily use, but it aint cuttin no arm hair. Real deal knives are supposed to be able to shave hair. I will be taking this to a good sharpener as soon as i find one. Had to take a star off for this .
Fits good, and feels very durable. No itching or discomfort. Also does give a degree of protection from wind and water, not as much as a real deal uniform, but enough for civy use .
This is a very nice keyboard, construction is smooth and solid all around, many nice features and highly customizable. Perfect for Strategy and MMO players, but also useful for FPS'ers. The only downfalls is that there is no Blue LED. Instead of Red Green and Blue, theres Red Green and Amber. Also, the spacing of LED's under the keys is a we bit sparse and certain keys are a little brighter than others. Other than that, if your looking for an awesome gaming keyboard that has a great and unique look and feel, this is the one. This board most definitely beats out most $100+ boards .
After having these for a few months, i have bad news to report. The first couple of prints from these cartridges were fine, but after a couple of months of inactivity, these cartridges will now only print blank pages. It has something to do with the ink sensor inside the cartridge. After much research, i have concluded that cheaply refilled dell series 2 ink cartridges are not making proper contact with the Encoder Band inside the printer, which is responsible for squirting the ink out of the cartridge onto the paper. I have also seen news that ALL dell series 2 cartridge ink sensors CANNOT be reset after they are used, therefore in theory, all refilled dell series 2 cartridges will have problems. I also have two black cartridges that i bought from Abacus that i put in just to see, and after a couple of weeks they are both working fine. Maybe theres something Abacus is doing that Enviroinks is not. I cannot guarantee that all cartridges are like this, but all should be weary .
On my last bag of the 4 pack, as far as i can say, they all taste great and burn great, not too much of a mess and no popping. Would definitely recommend .
Good fit, comfortable and feels durable. provides a degree of protection from wind and water, not as much as a real deal uniform but enough for civy use .
Best work gloves ive ever had. 6 Months of heavy use and not a scratch or tear in them. Very comfy aswell .
These bulbs are of very high quality, no bad bulbs and the coating is the best ive ever seen. Also, the element itself looks to be red aswell. And the price is great. The only downfall is since they have that extra coating, they're not as bright as other 5watt c7 bulbs.If your not worried about brightness then this is an excellent buy .
Very nice cable, nice thickness to it so it doesn't kink or bend, cool color, and the connectors are perfect for tight situations, and they lock in place .
These are very nice socks for warm weather, they breathe very well and my feet are always dry and cool when i pull them out of the boots, but for cold weather, they don't really work that well due to their design. They have an extra band in the middle of them that makes them fit tightly to the foot, wich means less warm air trapped inside the sock. The side effect of this extra band is that it is very hard for this sock to come off inside your shoe/boot, wich i usually have problems with, especially when running in boots. These have yet to come off. I would recommend these to everyone looking for a good warm weather running/working/general comfort sock .
This is a poorly made splitter. After some light use, the black casing will slide off exposing the insides, and no matter what, if you use multiple devices at once, one of them will get distorted sound, as if there's a short somewhere. The ports are too close together, which means any cords that you plug in must be low profile like this device. And lastly, the 3 sectioned jack doesn't like to work right on some devices, like phones and mp3 players, and older devices from back in the day.The only pros i can think of is the low profile design, abnormally strong and sturdy cable, and sleek look. Other than that it kinda sucks .
After a few months of use, i am finally writing a review for this battery. I still get around 2 days of life on this battery if im lightly using the phone. Heavy use (music and gaming) i get a full day. I must recommend this to everyone who has an electrify or photon, but batteries are like eggs, don't be surprised if you get a bad one .
This is a decent cooler for its price but it could be so much better.1. Construction - As most other reviewers have stated, the construction is flimsy at best and heavy mobile use will eventually lead to an accident. Also the metal &#34;incline&#34; bar likes to pop out of slot sometimes wich is bad for the laptop. Also, the unit needs to be propped up on 4 &#34;legs&#34; (i use small square wooden blocks at each corner&#34; to actually get a decent airflow from the bottom.2. Fan - The fan is big, but it doesn't turn fast at all even at max. And it doesnt push that much air to your laptop. After a month of use, i can only get a 2 or 3 degree drop in CPU temperature and a 5 - 10 degree drop on VGA and HDD from this unit.3. Lighting - The red LED is nice and is the main reason i ordered this unit. I thought it would compliment my red backlit keyboard and red lights that i use to operate my computers in the dark. Well i was wrong. The LED is %100 invisible when you have a laptop sitting on the unit, and therefore is of no use at all.4. Size - This unit is advertised to fit 17&#34; inch Laptops. Good luck getting a 15&#34; inch to fit good on it. This unit is for Android Tablets and netbooks when it comes to size.5 - Conclusion - Do not buy! There has to be better products out there for the same price. If your set on a red LED laptop cooler, forget it because very very few Cooler LED's are visible once a laptop is sat on them. Thermaltake kicks ass just not at Laptop Coolers yet .
This is a good beanie, but it has a few things that could be better. The shape of the beanie is a little cone-ish. It could also be a little thicker to protect from wind and cold. Other than that, the fabric is nice feeling and well stitched, no loose threads so far. It is also very comfortable once you get it situated, and also stays in place alot better than most beanies if you have long hair .
This light is one of the best USB lights ive owned. I play PC Games in a dark garage at night, and the Red light is perfect for illuminating the laptop keyboard and whatever else i need to see. The 3 light levels are cool, but the button feels a bit loose and wobbly, but so far has taken all my punishment. The neck is very bendable and twistable and seems to not want to twist at the connection base of the the USB plug, wich is good so the internal cord won't twist up and snap. Overall a great product and the ONLY Red LED USB Light you'll find out right now .
These are the best boxers ive ever owned. They are very comfy, have no tag to bother you, and also bend very well with the body when stooping, crouching, crawling or any other activity that require extreme bending of the body. They are also well ventilated to help dissipate &#34;Man Heat&#34; and &#34;Man Sweat&#34;. Would recommend them to everyone .
I was very excited when i forst got this coat. It looks very good and is very comfortable. Then i found out one of the pocket buttons was mis-aligned when it was pressed onto the jacket, and there is no way to fix it due to the broke off piece being stitched inside the lining if the pocket. Also, after 2 weeks of light - moderate use, this coat is already falling apart. Threads are coming loose all over the jacket, and i will haft to get my Gma to fix some of the inner-liner buttons that were very poorly stitched on with loose threads. I would not recommend this coat to anyone. Ive heard so much about Rothco. Well i tell ya, my experience with them sucks so far. Stay away from this coat no matter how cool it looks .
This may be the greatest external hard drive case ive owned. And ive owned a few. It fits very well in the pocket and is smooth on the outside. The cable that comes with it is big and fat too witch is good for stress/tension. The case is also very well designed, both sides pop off at the touch of a button, although you will need some good thumbnails to press the button all the way down. Then you can take any 2.5' Hard Drive and slide it in, pop the two sides back on and your ready to go.The only con i can think of, is what makes this design work. The SATA connector is a bit flimsy, and feels like it can be broken off, but it has to be like this so it can move at an angle to connect to the hard drive when you slide it in. If it wasn't flimsy, you would break it before you got a hard drive in it. So as a precaution, be careful when you insert or remove a hard drive .
I would like to say Thank you but I NEVER RECEIVED THE MEMORY I JUST OPEN THE BOX I FIND ONLY THE CAMARA & BACK PACK if I don't write before is because I was away so I come back last night then I opened the box I find only 2 thinghs so I would like to know what happen now .
This book was a gift so I couldn't really check it out in great detail. Anyway, I am a german living in the states and what made me buy this book and not any other one was because most of the other &#34;german cookbooks&#34; on amazon were written by americans inspired by german cuisine, or &#34;americanized german recipes&#34;.This book was written by germans living in Germany and claims itself &#34;not americanized&#34;!Since it was a gift I didn't really have a lot of time to check it out in great detail but briefly looking through it I think this was a good choice .
this game was one of my first games on a pc and  i loved it! when I saw that it was only $2 to download I didn't even think about it but just clicked Buy!!and it's still an awesome game!! it works perfect and playing it has brought back so many great memories .
it works just fine on my HP Laserjet 4100TN! Will buy it again!The print is good! Nothing more to say .
GREAT DEAL!It is a Guitar, it comes with extra strings and a pipe (I don't use the pipe) and a bag and a strap and a pick (the pick is strange; pretty big, never saw a pick like that before) for like nothing at all.Of course the guitar is cheap and shouldn't be used for someone trying to make professional music with ultra good sound but for me, since I only play for hobby-reasons, its great.The guitar itself smelled a bit chemical when I opened the package but that was gone after 1 day. The color is good, no trips or something.Ofcourse the bag is NOT protective at all but it's good for preventing the guitar to get dusty and you can carry it around in it if you are careful and don't hit anything. The bag is just one layer of polyester but it does it's job!All the strings were fine when I got the guitar and still are (after 2 weeks). I can really suggest that ANYONE who is looking for a cheap solid guitar to play just for the reason of playing to BUY this guitar!You ain't gonna regret it .
The product is great!the design is very cool, shiny black not fancy stuff, just black.The sound is very good. the highs are very clear the bass is very deep and full. Middle great as well.But you have to know how. First of all, change your Equalizer. it REALLY!! makes a huge difference. second, place the sound system on a dresser or something like that, it increases the bass incredibly and makes it even better.Linking up with the devices (iphone 4s and macbook pro) worked perfectly fine if you read the instructions.But: sometimes (once every ten minutes) the sound experiences small problems. but they don't last half a second so it's fine if you're not a soundphile person.I love them and can only recommend them.Update: Since many people experienced problems after a short while I just wanted to say that I bought it four months ago, use it everyday and didn't have single problem .
so far so good.Nice mat. looks like good quality.made of coconut fibers with I guess is a good thing.Can't say something about the lifetime. Only had it for a week now. I'm using it indoors so I guess that should increase the lifetime .
First of all: I'm not a professional photographer but rather the average "snapshot-guy" who travels around and likes to take some picture here and then. And because of that I wanted to go just a little further than the normal iphone camera.I bought this set for $20 (super saver shipping arrived in 5 days!) and I totally love it.The lenses appear to have a good quality (no flaws,...) and the set up was fairly easy.At first I thought the macro was broken but then I found out that you have to get REALLY REALLY close to the object and then you get awesome sharp shots!the fish eye is awesome and I don't know if its really 180 degrees, but it must be pretty close. Wide Angle is fun and is great for pictures of rooms and stuff because it covers way more than the usual iphone camera. I recommend using the 8x zoom with the tripod and you get awesome pictures, but even without it you can get good shots!Also, the case fits my iphone perfectly!long story short: I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!! it was so cheap but still very good!everyone who wants to go a little further than the usual iphone camera should definitely buy this! It's a lot of fun .
I believe this is a great "backyard mechanic" tool. Coming from a professional mechanic, I bought this tool for home use. I researched many different devises and price. Capability was also a big factor. Being able to download updates online is a BIG factor. The ease of use and the friendly tech support just reassured my original feeling of this tool. The amount of the capability of this tool you get makes it worth far more than the price. Then you still get the tech support on top of that! I am not only extreamly satisfied with my new toy but, YES, I would recommend this devise to anyone with intrest in home OBD2 drivetrain vehicle repairs .
I really like this jacket!!! It fits really well, and it is not to bit or to small it fits just right .
from what im reading so far great stuff/everybody wants 2 read it.its stuff u never read or heard before 5stars .
Came in the mail as expected!!! I was so excited once it came in, everything was perfect! The badge grabbed my attention the most once i flipped the wallet open xD i couldn't stop staring at it lol I showed it off to my friends, they were mega jealous! IMMA S.T.A.R.S MEMBER!!! WHHOOHHHOOOOO .
Kinda disappointed that it didn't have the chain at the end of the sword, but i didn't really care. Its not sharp at all (but the tips are) its kinda heavy too (: this is a really cool sword, it was so worth buying .
This may as well be the best Wii game I have ever played. It came in a wrapped package, like new. The instruction packet was included, though evidently used. No problems with the game at all it's perfect. Hard to believe people buy it for $80 when I scored it for $25 for practically the same quality .
These boots are wonderful.  At 3 degrees F.  my feet were not the least bit cold.  I would recommend these boots to anyone.  Good Buy .
Unfortunately the advertisement did not mention the item I bought was a small size and would not fit a man with size 12 feet so its totally worthless to Me.  Product arrived in a timely manner and in good condition.  It looks like just what I need, but unfortunately is way to small.  Guess when I eventually have a garage sale I have one more item to put in it .
Product arrived in a timely manner in good condition.  Unfortunately for Me, I bought this thinking it would work with My blue yeti microphone, but alas no.  The shock mount is for a normal skinny type mic and the mounting thread is a non standard size so I could not put My yeti shock mount onto this arm.  At some point in the future I may get a mic that will fit this for use, but for the time being its not in the cards.  Good product tho.  I did set it up on the desk and it would have filled the bill perfectly if only the fitting would have supported putting My mic on it .
Soulene is an engaging, creative and historically edifying novella. Children (of all ages) will love it: while the story traces a potentially real figure in an historically accurate context, it is no less magical for its truthfulness. Soulene, the central figure, is training to be nurse, or "healer" in the parlance of the story. On her travel to her schools, in England and France, she meets and offers medical help to a wounded knight (whom she will meet again under surprising circumstances), flees for her life with her two faithful dogs and a new animal friend she calls "Horse," and interacts with many other engaging characters. The description of her life in the woods is engrossing, taking the reader to a captivating place which feels like something between "Harry Potter" and "The Wind in the Willows." It is also a coming of age story that echoes "True Grit" in the manner in which this young girl defines a task and sets out, against significant obstacles, to accomplish it. My kids are eagerly awaiting (a slightly longer) volume 2 .
What is all the hype about? This is a perfect example of &#34;the emperor's new clothes:&#34; there really is nothing there. There is no substantive script, and no space (sic) for real acting. The special effects are boring and vertigo-inducing: stuff keeps spinning around and Bullock's primary contribution is panting like she is in labor. The events are so far-fetched and illogical they further minimize an already minimal experience. What a disappointment. She and the movie were both nominated for oscars; somebody must have lobbied hard and long .
The cinnamon is super strong, which I guess I should have expected. It wasn't bad but not as good as the other types I tried .
Not sure why other people don't like these, The brushes arrived in perfect condition,I received this package in the mail, the brush set is not professional quality, but It is great for me, because I practiced nail art on my own nails, make beautiful lines The handles are made of hard plastic, the only thing is the brushes that i purchased are not the same as the picture .
So nice looking on nails, very easy to use, it was amazing packed  well and there is no damage, compare to similar of this, super great product, that's include the price and free shipping, by my house i found a Sally Beauty Store, and they don't have this Nail Tape Stripe, and i wasn't happy, because when i called to the store they told me they have this product in the store, and that's why i like amazon, because i can find everything, and i'm happy .
"I love this product, I love the colors,They arrived nicely wrapped, and great price and free shipping, and one of the color was out of stock and they included another neon color, and in my next order the seller its going to include the missing color at not cost, and this is very nice, and this package does not take to long to arrive to my home, this polish nail are perfect for my nail art designs .
I bought this lamp for my acrylic work, I'm super happy because the price was very good, with free delivery, all you pay a tax, but I get ahead of schedule, very well packed, and in good condition, I look elsewhere and had it for a higher price, dries fast, and I like that does not occupy much space and has a fairly long power cord, my friends liked it, I highly recommend it, the transaction was clear and very fast, and they sent me an email notifying me the update, and hope to make another purchase in the future with the seller .
I ordered these brushes because I didn't want to spend a fortune on an acrylic brush,good price, The brushes came  very fast it came before the set date, Brush Size: #4, #6, #8, #10, #12, It is safe and easily to be used, ready to try them out in a few days, only i got one brush that is not the same like the others, colorful handles makes it fun to work with them, but at the end, i'm happy with my order .
usually i wouldn't spend this much on tweezers but I think this is an awesome brand,I absolutely love this pair of tweezers, They are great because i can get the perfect size of rhinestone, I am glad I bought them, excellent goods, these tweezers came in fast delivery, Packing good, Great tool & very easy to use,  I would recommend this to a friend, Thanks .
I ordered the 350buy Fashion Caviar Nails Art New 12 Colors plastic Beads Manicures, I was looking for this caviar pearls for my nails,I was fortunate to find it available on Amazon.com, for extraordinary price,  I thought it was an absolutely fantastic idea to create a 3D effect with tiny pearls on my nails for my son's graduation, The application of the pearls is very easy, The package is in a cardboard box with the product details on the front, the caviar pearls are in a  transparent plastic packaging and can keep each color in their place, I am really satisfied with my product .
This wheel has any color you can imagine to create gorgeous nail art or enhance your basic manicure, i got good quality crystals, and plenty of them, The design options are endless, These are durable and lightweight, so if you have a small nail surface you might want to go with these because it won't feel heavy on your nail, The price for this product is also very affordable, so i can get treat myself to a little luxury and look amazing, super fast shipping, i'm happy with my order .
Just what I wanted, I placed my order on May 21, 2013 and I got the package on May 29, 2013, very fast delivery, product arrived flawless, perfect packing, you can use these rhinestones on many other things, pleasant colors, the only thing I thought would be a little bigger wheel, bring half and half drops of pictures, easy to open, and the price is not bad, and I pay for shipping , great seller, would buy again! Thank you .
The item was received exactly as specified and the price was good,The colors are great and there are 12 colors with no duplicates.  Brand New, Easy to apply on natural or artificial nails, this are perfect for my nail art, the most important thing is the case, because the case works fine, and i can keep all my Rhinestones in order, I recommend  this product .
Tthe faucet was easy to repair in minimal time. The cartridge changed out smoothly and worked well. No more leaks .
The suit was extremely cute! But unfortunately the pants were too long for the baby. You guys should consider shortening the length of the pants considering most babies don't have long legs like that .
Bought this for my fiance's Jeep - He couldn't be happier! He loves the light bar. Extremely bright and very nice quality.thanks again .
It's cute but It doesn't fit properly I feel like If I want to take it off it might break .
I ordered this case 3 days ago from amazon, the shipping and handling was very fast. When I got my phone case it was broken on the one side and didn't fit properly on my phone. The description of the phone case is HARD CLEAR case and I did not get that at all. I got a cheap piece of plastic that you could fold together. The back of this phone case was also blurry. False advertisement on this product .
The almost perfect mix of comedy, action, romance, and length. A solid choice for any mecha lover. Its not as much drama as eva but it works .
So far I have not had any problem with the screen protecto. I would purchase another.  Love the fact I can't tell if I have a screen protector on my phone(very clear .
Ordered this as a first laptop for my preteen. Works great but is slow. Do not put a lot on it or it will slow down .
FOR THOSE NOT LUCKY ENOUGH TO UNDERSTAND THE BOND THAT A MOTHER AND A DUAGHTER MUST HAVE TO CREATE SUCH A WONDERFUL BELIEVABLE, KINDA OF PLACE. WERE YOU YOUR SELF FEEL AS IF YOU ARE IN THE VERY PLACE WERE THE AUTHORS WILL TRANSPORT YOU, WILL MAKE YOU A BELIEVER...A KIND OF MAGICAL POWER ONLY THIS MOTHER AND DAUGHTER CAN ACCOMPLISH! I NOT ONLY LOVED THE TANSITIONS OF THE CHARACTERS AND THE HOLE BOOK I COULD NOT STOP READING FROM START TO FINISH.I BELIEVE THIS WILL BE THE FIRST OF MANY BOOK PUPLISHED BY THIS MOTHER DAUGTER TEAM. THERE WRITING IS VERY TALENTED AND I PERSONALY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO ALL AGES YOUNG AND OLD YOU WILL FALL IN LOVE WITH THE STORY OF  ALEC AND HIS FRIENDS JUST TRYING TO GO THREW LIFE THE BEST WAY THEY KNOW HOW. I CAN NOT WAIT TILL BOOK TWO.A MUST READ .
Do not buy seriously. Its like the worst material ever and it would fit a small kid. looks super cute in the picture but NO it is not cute on. I put it on and everyone of my roommates laughed historically its awful .
charger didn't work and batteries are very weak.  the only reason i bought this was because my charging port is not working properly.  If you are having this problem i suggest you just buy a wireless charging pad cost about the same but works so much better .
Best buy on Internet!!! Others offer same thing for far more. Was here in no time and exp was for 10 yrs from now which is great for prepping .
Belt is very nice and durable.thats the good. the bad the &#34;screwdriver &#34; is a half inch very thin piece of metal that can't be used. And fishing kit is cheep .
It's not worth the aggregation!! I have a LG Cosmos. It fit's around your phone but you have to take it off to use your phone. It covers up all the function control buttons such as the volume, unlock, messaging, changing between characters/symbols, optional. It also interferes with sliding your phone opening to use the keyboard. I did contact Electromaster - stated it was meant for the LG Cosmo 2 phones. They were not very helpful and told me I needed to e-mail someone else. THERE IS A GOOD REASON "WHY IT WAS SUCH A LOW PRICE!!!"  I will be sure to contact AMAZON to help me deal with this issue. I will probably need to throw this away cause it might damage the phone. If the seller doesn't seem to take care of the problem. Do your research before you buy. If it really cheap, there is a reason behind why!!!http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0026PV6RI/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title .
I have an android phone and the battery dies fast. This is useful when I'm not at home and the size is perfect for charging. I am definitely satisfied .
Super useful when I'm on-the-go! Android battery isn't that great so it's helpful. Charges iPads great too. Gona take it with me when I go camping .
Neither power cord that came with pump fit. This has got to be the dumbest product I've ever purchased, someone needs to be shot for such an oversight .
Fragrance to use day by dayI recomend for women whose don't like anything strongIt keeps for a long time .
The screen protector sucks when i got in in the mail it had marks all over it and the back one doesn't even fit the back .
I really like Netflix....very convenient and everyone in my family enjoys watching Netflix whenever they want. We are very happy .
This was a very good read. It kept thinking about the characters when I wasn't reading the book. I hope that part 2 is even better.I recommended this book to a couple of very close friends .
This book is incredible I love love love it can wait for the next one diamond McKinney can I just say no homo but I love you lol .
reading it you can give it no less then 5 star.stop running to find what's in you heartand being to live .
this stony was amazing and true to the heart when love comes their is nothing you can do but accept it .
From the first time I opened them, I am extremely blown away by these headphones. My only warning is that your ears are VERY prone to get hot while exercising wearing these and it's easy for people around you to hear. The bass is powerful and the on-ear style is very comfy. This is the perfect companion to listen to anything anywhere, just not while active .
magnification times too high, not fit for hand-hold.  magnification times too high, not fit for hand-hold.  magnification times too high, not fit for hand-hold .
Very good product. Much better than the Santa Medical one we purchased first and had to throw out because it gobbled up batteries. The Nonin has same battery now for over 6 weeks. Accuracy matches the professional units used by the nurses at rehab center. Thinking of buying another one for another member of the family. Do not hesitate because of price - it is clearly the best on the market .
Disappointed with battery life. A set of batteries lasts less than 2 days. Apparently auto-shutoff does not stop current flow. Accuracy is good. However could not use it at rehab center as batteries were always dead. Cannot recommend .
Since the title says &#34;belly button rings&#34; (plural) I thought I'd be getting all five. I only received one and did not get to pick the color. The belly button ring I got is still cute, but not what I was expecting .
My granddaughter, 12, has been doing nails for a while, and has always had trouble finding small brushes to draw designs on with. The brushes for these polishes are a perfect fine tip, and the colors can't be found anywhere else.LOVE IT .
I struggled with this book.  Chapters too long.  Didn't care for writers style.  Would not recommend.  Not what I expected .
It's been awhile since I read it, so I cannot recall specifics.  I just recall that I didn't like it .
I was recently diagnosed with breast cancer of the right breast -- second time around for me after being cancer free for 16+ years.  A lot of great changes have taken place since my first surgery (1997), a lumpectomy and lymphnode excision followed by radiation; e.g. sentinel node biopsy (made standard of practice 1 yr. following my surgery); Oncontype DX test.  Through Dr. Love's Breast Book, I learned about the advancements made since 1997, and learned about the pros and cons of aromatase inihibitors.  One big change since my first cancer in 1997, is that chemotherapy is not always the adjuvant treatment of choice depending on the type of cancer.  I learned from Dr. Love's book that because I am estrogen and progesterone receptor positive, and the fact that I am negative for HER-2/neu, my cancer would not benefit from chemotherapy.  This was confirmed by my doctors.  For these reasons and others, I have opted for a bilateral mastectomy with immediate reconstruction.  I have been informed that I will be admitted for only 23 hrs. following surgery, not the &#34;few days&#34; admission stated in the book.  That is the only thing in my experience I have found different from that presented in the book.  I found the book very beneficial in that it made me a more informed patient and therefore able to communicate better with my medical team .
Easy to set up; use it for dog to get on bed.  Bought it in advance of an upcoming surgery that places physical restrictions on me, including not picking up my 10-lb. dog.  He loves to sleep with me and didn't want to deny him getting on the bed just because I won't be able to lift him for a time.  Was able to quickly train him to use by placing treats on the stairs, moving the treat up 1 step at a time.  Now, just need to direct him verbally to use the stairs by saying, &#34;Stairs, Buddy&#34; and he climbs up them without the use of treats.  He still likes to just jump down from the bed, but that's okay.  At least he's learned to climb up them without my assistance .
This time you lose is one of those books that you can't stop reading. I read it on my kindle i am just turning 13 years old as of october but i have finished reading this time you lose in approximately 1 and a half days this book for me was action packed definetly one of my favorites and definetly on my top ten this i will be looking for more of your books to read. Thankyou for being a great author Sincerely Ariana Knighton .
Fit my tablet perfectly and was a good deal with fast shipping no squeegee included but I used a card so no biggie .
Baby didn't like bath time until he got these to play with now he has a great time in the tub .
It was for my wife and she loved it. I don't think she put it down for long and the savings were great .
Amazing game worth every penny can't wait till I get my ps4 version still going to be my favorite mmorpg .
I give it 5 stars because it is an amazing show. Yes it does get even better in the later seasons but this establishes the characters and the many plots to come. Not my very favorite season but this show is so good it still is great entertainment .
The extras are unusual and amazing i love this collection a must for all Keaton fanatics. Things you won't see elsewhere .
I love this pitcher but I don't like the lid arrangement. The lid seals too poorly to shake the contents .
All the reviews say that the top line of the cover is off, and they are correct! However, if you can get over that, the color is awesome. I couldn't get over that though...blame it on the OCD tendencies .
Obviously an awesome show. I adore it. Amazon let me download it quickly and hassle free but the quality isn't the greatest. It isn't bad though .
T.E. Lawrence was a very reserved person, who was virtually forced to take the lead in the Arab revolt, to try and get some sort of sense, from the situation he found himself in.He was able to take advantage of his wide experience, for a young man, in the regional history and culture of the Arabs, to gain entry into their midst, without seeming too English. He had spent several years in Palestine and surrounds, studying the many Crusade Fortresses and general culture.He was also able to get a high level of Authority in the British side of things, through these same first hand and in depth experiences and because he was in the British Army already.Once he was able to get in contact with the Arab side, in the form of Prince Faisal, he had an amazing influence on the whole revolt, instead of only having a passive influence, as an adviser he took the lead and became in fact a very successful General soldier, leading his part of the war effort, by using Gorilla tactics, he was able to discomfort the Turks and force their retreatFinally he was able to take Damascus and if he had been able to unite the various Arab factions, he would have really changed history in the region, to the point that today would still have seen the effects he would have caused, but unfortunately that didn't happen and we are where we are now, because of British interference in Palestine, after the Arab revolt.Lawrence has given us an amazing piece of Literary work, that stands out in our 21st century as a beacon of what mankind can do, if he is working from a clean heart, not just for lucre.Lawrence also was a victim of his own success and fame followed him everywhere he went and with a certainty that he was suffering from Post Traumatic Stress, he had a bad time of itI believe that he could have very easily taken High Public Office after the war finished, had he been recognised properly for his work, but instead he gave us Seven Pillars of Wisdom .
Well, I could not put the book down.  If it was really possible for an Amish man to be President, it would be a great day for our nation.  The values in the book Josiah had are exactly what the Amish believe and at one time the citizens of America had those same values, but they appear to be disappearing.  Oh how we need leadership like Josiah .
it is a nice simple ring but it was not what i was expecting. the turquoise &#34;stone&#34; was barely a stone at all.. i do wear it and its nice but i am still looking for another turquoise ring .
Muy buen producto y precio, llego tal cual aparece en la foto, la coloque en mi tel&eacute;fono y funciono perfectamente satisfecho .
Le quedo excelente a mi tel&eacute;fono lo cubre y lo protege donde debe proteger y deja libre lo que debe estar libre,excelente material y acabado,muy buena compra .
Not sure if the keyboard works or not, like so many other reviewers, because there was NO directions telling us that we would need an adapter.  The picture is misleading because it shows the adapter with the connection.  In fact, it says to plug the connection right into the tablet.  Now I have to go get one, not a big deal if I had just known specifically that I need to order one at the same time .
my girlfriend loved this neckless. i wair it all the time. and so dose she. i have been wairing it for about 5 monts and it has no scraches or anything. i would say the only thing that i don't like is that the girls chain, the clip on it comes undone sometimes if its pulled on or something. but you only have to bend it back alittle. then everything works perfictly again .
Worked better than any of the three other stay-down products we have tried.  Excellent product!  We have an articulating bed, so sheets were constantly sliding up and off of the mattress.  Not so with these .
I bought this because I liked the movie better than the first one, even though I think the original is also a great movie. Little Lady actually does good at continuing from the first movie unlike some where some of the details don't make sense between original and sequel. This movie is worth buying just for the parts of Ted Danson pretending to be a minister .
The Masters saga is good since it ties in the story for the Robotech series. Yes Dana's character is a scatterbrain but she isn't too serious either. I wish they would have made episodes for after the Masters and into when the Invid arrived for more detail about what happened to the Army of the Soutern Cross and the members of 15th squadron .
Scottie was a great character in the original series and having him on Next Gen made for a perfect episode. The fact that original Enterprise crew didn't show up that often in TNG makes this figure an even better grab in my opinion .
This is an awesome series whether or not you're an anime fan. I used to watch this show back when it was on Cartoon Network (back when that channel had more shows I actually wanted to watch). If you're already starting to get into anime, this series is a can't miss .
The cards I got were pretty well what I expected. All of them were in excellent shape. I loved that there were some cards that came from cereal box specials and others like that. It's a good buy for a kid or someone starting a collection. The only thing I have a problem with is that they didn't actually come in a card box .
Well written and insightful. Well worth my time and a a very appreciated new view on a not often explored topic. I hope that there is a follow up to this story and that by sharing her story new in roads to the science of eye disease will be made .
This movie is fun for the whole family, perhaps a little frightening at times for the under 5 crowd. My two boys who are 5 and two love it, but always watch it with my husband or I. It is one movie that we don't groan when we have to watch .
We just received these are beginning to track my cycle, however I have to give them a decent rating as I am not knocked up. Will update next month .
Everything was to spec so it fit perfectly. We used it for our sailboats hot water tank. I searched for this product at other name brand hardware stores and this one was by far the cheapest for the same exact product. ...and shipped to my door! Can't beat that .
Nice thick tape, never hade a problem with this brand breaking or peeling. Dispenser is very easy to use. This is not the cheapest packing tape, but you get what you pay for and this does the job .
Used a lot stupid and other insults. I had such fond memories of Charlie Brown, but found myself cringing when watching this with my two little boys. Would not recommend .
These are a good price and work as three season boots, similar to bogs or muck boots, however the craftsmanship is not as good as the far more expensive brands. I am not sure these will last more than a few seasons as I see a small section of rubber has come unglued to the neoprene after only a few months. It does not affect function yet, but it is probably only a matter of time. For the price I am quite satisfied with these as they have made it through 3 months of a Maine winter .
Very lightweight, perfect size for 4 or 5 year oldIt floats, that is great for any age.Cast action is simple and very easy to useThe spool is a good size to limit overrides, does not jam in the spool, like most reelsPractice plug is a great feature.Has a penguin or two, but not obnoxious, like most of the children's rods that are covered with characters. Once this is out of the packaging, looks like a nice blue and white fishing rod .
These are definitely not my idea of slip ons. They are incredibly stiff and even though I sized up, I could not get them on my feet. I have never had that issue before. They are nice looking and have great tread and perhaps they would stretch? But I wasn't willing to deal with the discomfort to find out. Back they went .
The color is meh. Just meh. Not horrible, but it is olive green with a bright green fabric showing. These were comfortable right out of the box. I could tell they were very well made and will hold up well .
My boys love Richard Scarry. They have many of his books and several of his videos. This one is meh. Not terrible, but certainly not the best out there. I would recommend sticking to his &#34;Best Ever&#34; series .
These are not lingerie, they are simple, comfortable stay put undies. Very thin. They do the job. I would not recommend putting them in the dryer .
Not really sure that chia seeds need to be organic, however these are a good value and a good source of nutrition. We like our sprinkled on cereal. As a quick pudding in coconut milk and honey or to thicken pumpkin pie .
the new printer did not seem to like my computer am trying to sort it out .with help from an expert .
It's been well over a month and I haven't gotten what I paid for. I reached out to them to see what was  going on n they weren't helpful at all. I would never order from them again. It's the 2nd time with these overseas dealers  it's really frustrating .
steps were fast..and direction..also music was not what i expected? It is good for experienced Zumba dancers workout,but someone who is starting needs warm up and simple direction before steps-squats- ect...I got it as a start,but will try someone else .
I like this professional CD player, user freindly and looks great.. we have a lot of fun with it...no regrets here,so far .
All worth the cost/price for this amplified speaker ( as so many to choose from..) i went with this model/type to fit my budget and not waste my money, well.. it was a good choice.. user frendly-Loud enough for my use.. (classroom) and backyard (gatherings) i plug and play my CD player and mic-up to have some fun .
Took a try at this.. and did not like and work for me...very uncomfortable, burns-stings some, smells... not worth the try .
i used as directed- have no great improvement from use of my first and only bottle. I am not sure if i would try this again .
I bought this stick was in a pinch and on a budget,i honestly am not all that pleased with the button lay out the HAT switch is off set and at least for me feels awkward.The stick is very comfortable very nice grip feel.The buttons on the base a virtually flush with the surface of the base and that means you have to look down to find them taking your eyes off the screen,anyone who flys  combat simulation knows thats NOT ideal .
These 25 foot cables work really good, the sound quality is great with them. I got a couple of them. The price can't be beat. A 6 foot 3.5mm extender would be more to buy in a store than these 25 foot cables online .
This 50ft CAT5e cable is great, especially for the low price of just $4.68!I'm using it to connect my surveillance camera DVR (which is hidden in a cabinet in the dining room) to my AT&T; router/modem, and it's working perfectly. I ran it along the baseboard from the dining room to the living room (there isn't a wall dividing the dining room and living room in my house).I'm very glad I found this. The 50ft CAT5 cable at Walmart is around $30 .
I used these to connect extra 50ft cables to the 60ft cables that came with my Zmodo camera system. They work great. I didn't notice any quality loss either. It's better to buy them in packs of 10 like this rather than individually because although I don't need 10 of them, it's much cheaper to buy them like this (I paid just under $4 for these) and if I ever do need more someday I have extra ones .
I've had this monitor for several months now, and it is great. The colors are crisp and clear and it is nice and bright. I can't see any light around the edges even when the screen is displaying something with a dark background.I plug it into my MacBook Air and use an Apple Wireless Keyboard and Magic Mouse to make a desktop out of my laptop. It works pretty good.P.S. I didn't buy this on Amazon, I bought this monitor at Best Buy, but it's the same monitor .
This is a great system, I really like it. Here's my review about it.Note: I didn't purchase this on Amazon but this is the exact system that I bought so I decided to write a review about it here.This system comes with the DVR, four cameras, four 60ft power+video siamese cables, a mouse, the power supply (power brick) for DVR, and a single power supply with a 4-way splitter for all of the cameras.- - - - - - - - - - - - -Part 1: The DVRThe DVR is great. It's nice and clean looking. The user interface looks crappy but I didn't pay much for it so I don't expect a pretty UI on it. It's also not that intuitive/user-friendly but I'm pretty familiar with it now . It was much easier than I thought it would be to install the hard drive. The screws on the DVR cover weren't even on it yet (they were in a bag with the hard drive screws) which made it easier to install the hard drive since I didn't have to unscrew each screw on the hard drive first. It came with the screws for the hard drive as well as the hard drive cover. I got a 500GB "white label" hard drive for $45 on another site and it's working great.The DVR has motion detection recording which is really nice. You can set it to continuously record or to only record when it detects motion. You can also set it up to send you an email when it detects motion and attach a picture of the motion it detected.- - - - - - - -EDIT: I have now successfully set up the networking stuff. It didn't take me too long, and I followed Zmodo's tutorial but I have experience with networking so it was pretty easy. You just have to open a few ports on your router. I can view my cameras anywhere on my iPhone as well as from any computer (that has Internet Explorer - ugh, I know... but it requires ActiveX to work). I couldn't get the email notification to work though - it just wouldn't work. I would've constantly been getting emails anyway though since the motion detection recording is triggered all the time.- - - - - - - -The DVR has 8 BNC video inputs, 2 BNC outputs, 4 RCA audio inputs, 2 USB inputs (one for mouse and one for flash drive to back up files), 1 ethernet input, 1 VGA output (for monitor), and the power input.- - - - - - - - - - - - -Part 2: The CamerasThis system comes with 4 cameras but the DVR is 8 channel so I have the ability to extend it if I need to add more cameras. The cameras were a little bigger than I expected them to be, but they're not too big. A couple years ago I got a couple of Lorex cameras from Radio Shack, and they're a bit smaller than these Zmodo cameras; I was expecting the Zmodo cameras to be as small as the Lorex ones. They do have more IR lights (night vision) on them though. The Lorex cameras that I previously had have microphones built in to them but the Zmodo cameras do NOT have microphones. I'm using the Lorex camera for the front door (so I have audio) but you can buy this small microphone to attach to one or more of the Zmodo security cameras for audio:VideoSecu High Sensitive Audio Pickup Device External Amplified Tiny Spy Microphone for CCTV Security Camera with Bonus Warning Decal WD6You'll have to purchase a cord that has the audio though too (they're available here on Amazon - 100ft video+audio+power cable for around $10).The cameras come with brackets and the mounting screws. It's kind of difficult to get it just right but I haven't had issues with the mounting brackets like others have had - they didn't break and I tightened it pretty good. Also, the camera colors are pretty accurate. I noticed some people have said that the camera colors aren't accurate but mine are pretty accurate.The night vision isn't that great, but it's better than just a black screen. You can see more than shadows but still not enough to identify someone. Lights that are outside your house make the night vision better though.- - - - - - - - - - - - -Overall, I am very happy with this system. I got a nice 8 channel DVR with 4 cameras for a great deal.PLEASE NOTE: This system does not come with a hard drive installed in the DVR, you have to buy it separately. You can still view the cameras without the hard drive but you won't be able to record anything without it .
over a year now and still going strong. not the most hi tech system in the world but they get the job done and keep my employees honest .
I like these sandals but the strap is a little tight around the toe.  It may be because I wore them for the first time while out walking for a long day in DC.  They are super cute and overall comfortable.  I think if the leather stretches a little, I will be fine.  The sole is a little rubbery but it doesn't take away from the sandal .
Easy to clean! A little difficult to keep folded but it's a great blanket. The fleece on the top is nice and thin, so it's not too hot but it can definitely keep your bottom warm when cool outside. I purchased it for my son's soccer games and we enjoy it .
These sandals are cute and comfortable.  I like the fact that they are affordable and made in Italy.  At first I was going to return them for a larger size ( i ordered the 7.5) but after trying them on a 2nd time, the leather stretched a little bit, so I am keeping them.  The studs are cute and give them spice.  the toe straps are comfortable and not rigid.  I highly recommend them .
These are possibly the best shoes I've ever owned. Because they're leather, and not vinyl, they don't stick up my closet and they allow enough air in to keep nasty foot odor from occurring. Plus, they're just plain beautiful .
I haven't used much nail polish in my life, but this is the best I've ever tried. Lasts pretty well, dries quick, gorgeous hazy purple grey color .
Once upon a time, I bought a pair of this grey earbuds to use them when I'm outside and at school. When i first used them, I was shocked by the sound it delivered, even when I was outdoor. They have an EXCELLENT isolation from the noise outside. You put them on, press play and you can be in the middle of the traffic.... you WILL HEAR NO CAR. I also use them as ear protection when i'm in the workshop at school cutting wood with VERY loud machines. It protects your ears and also, the sound quality remains excellent.I've compared them with the Beats by Dre buds from a friend. Although the Beats cover very well the whole range of sound, the Skullcandy offer a more intense, powerful bass. It's like comparing the Monster's Studio and the Solo HD Dre headphones.They deserve the place in my heart for the best earbuds ever. However, I know that many people complain about the build quality. They lasted me 8 months... It's still a pretty decent run. They would have probably lasted more, but I borrowed them to some of my friends and they must have damaged the straight cable. One week after they returned them, my Left earbud was dead. My beloved Ink'd were unusable...To honor the best earphones that I had, I cut the Right one and put it on my key-chain. I really loved them.LESSON LEARNED: Never EVER EVER EVER borrow your headphones to anybody. Thrust NO ONE! hahahaLike all the stories that start with "Once upon a time...", this one has a happy ending too. I went to the store I first bought them and found them! It was the last pair, and I had to search for them a little bit, but there were finally mine again! This time is a black pair, that can't wait for the school to start. In my opinion, there are the best pair you can buy for the 20 (the price I here in Italy).Final judgement: THIS EARBUDS ROCKS!!!Cheers .
I have the Acer Aspire 7741G model with Core i5 (2.66 GHz), 6 Gb of RAM, 640 GB HDD and AMD Radeon HD 6550M. (It's the brother of this model)I bought this computer about 2 years ago. I'VE DID EVERYTHING WITH IT. I've even installed Mac OS X on it and IT WORKED.I am an architecture student and a freelance designer, so i need to run HEAVY software. AutoCAD, Photoshop, Illustrator, video editing, etc... it handles them like a charm! For multitasking, it's a great computer.For gaming... well, let's just say IT CAN handle new games (gta 4, assassins creed 1 to 3, COD MW 3 etc.) with no problems and graphics settings quite high, BUT it OVERHEATS... After some point, it "black outs" (shuts down and can't turn on for about 10 mins) for the heat. I've heard some people use cooling pads, but I haven't tried them yet.One thing i hate is the battery life... It's horrible! I can't even watch a full movie without recharging (in energy saving mode), but for me it's not a great problem. I almost always use it on a desk, so i really don't care that much.Anyway, in the long run, it's a pretty reliable machine. Only problem I had was with the HDD which was damaged (after i installed Mac OS and Win 7, and Mac OS and Win 7 for about 20 times). Most likely because of the repeated formats of the drive.THIS REMINDS ME I HAVE TO ADVICE EVERYONE ABOUT ONE THING: ALWAYS STORE YOUR IMPORTANT DATA ON AN EXTERNAL HARD DRIVE.I've learned my lesson when my first laptop crashed and i lost everything... Now for the grand finale.Pros & Cons for this bad boy:PRO: very fast processor, good screen, full keyboard, reliable*, lots of memory, very decent graphics (for a laptop), will still give you at least a couple more years of good use.CON: LAME BATTERY LIFE, keyboard build**, needs more USB ports, build quality (made of cheap plastic... i'm always afraid to break it when i have to take it outside), design**** if you don't abuse it like i did** although i love a full keyboard, the type on this model it's awful. The perfect keyboard type is on the mac book pro's or the sony vaio's.*** i prefer other designs, but this is not the worse i've seen. Also, i don't like the back lid texture because my stickers don't stick very well. lol .
I don't do this every day but am definitely noticing some tightening in my abs and my shoulders feel really strong. This is an intense set of moves and you do it twice through, faster the second time. I have done a couple of her other videos but this one and the kickboxing one are my favorites .
Not exactly what I expected but what I wanted.  It was introspective but was not a cutsie book about a dog and his person.  It was a nice read and I got a nice feel of climbing the White Mountains.  Some good family thoughtfulness.  I enjoyed it .
Thoroughly enjoyed Diva.  Description of the characters is strong and I began to see them well as the story unfolded.  Author did a good job making it seem that the story might go one way when it, in fact, went another. I enjoyed the way the author inserted the "shadows" theme. This was a fun read that I did not want to put down.  I am looking forward to the next book .
This was such a help to me this year.  I had a major illness and could not really face trying to get out to shop.  I was able to get these for family members who live a good distance away, which would have meant shopping AND shipping.  The grandkids loved them and there were plenty of items available for the parents as well.  Even better, I could deliver them via Face Book, which worked better than I ever imagined.  Great service and great idea that sure worked for me this year .
Not Great, Pretty standard. Looks pretty cheap, pretty loud when you step onto it. Works for me though, didn't break I way 200 lbs .
This fit just as expected! I couldn't wait for it to come! I love it and will order another! Great deal and good service .
My kids love this game so we had to buy it for every system. the only thing they dislike about it is they can't play online .
Predictable but enjoyable. I thought it was a bit rushed at the end. Some of the issues were not explored and sort of left hanging. Maybe they get resolved in the third book .
It only lasts for one hour of battery juice, not cool but it does work well so far .
The phone is already starting to have problems.  Sometimes when I text it turns itself off unexpectedly which is not good and I can only use it on speaker phone now because the outside earpiece isn't working anymore .
the movie does not play in american made dvd players.  i wished i had known that before i ordered it .
Could never get it to work.  Should have returned it, but didn't take the time too.  I had purchased two talking books at the grocery store this summer and they were cheaper and worked perfectly.  In fact, my grandaughter has played them so much that they are now hidden....for her parents sanity sake .
Moved the fan in our living room during a remodel and didn't like the way the sheet rock guys finished it off so decided to buy a medallion. This one matched my crown molding perfectly!  Easy to install .
when it arrived a month later it came broken worst product everi do not recommend you buying this product .
very bad product, broken wine. I did not like. I want my money reinstated. I found a steal. sorry so bad .
Not messy and fun. Creates beautiful pictures. We used them in the coloring book and on construction paper to design our own pictures. It was perfect during a kindergarten play date too! The girls and 3 year old brother painted, shared, and had great conversation .
did not receive ubs,  cord as it stated it was included.  No instructions as how to get clock off military time and onto regular time. No instructions on how of program or search FM radio stations. I feel that the instruction manual need a LOT OF WORK. A little to technical for the average person with limited computer  tech knowledge .
its good i couldn't get free and it is also soft on the wrists i like it a lot :3 .
These chairs are very comfortable and extremely well made. I would recommend these to anyone.You can't beat the price .
I am pleased with the overall product. The only problem i ran into was that after useing a heat gun on the strips,they wouldn't stick to the leather on my steering wheel like shown in the picture which is what i wanted most out of it. otherwise the product worked great around my stereo and shift nob which is made of some sort of plastic .
This sub is grreat i just installed it the other day and i already love the thing. the aluminum box resonates the sound really well. there is a metalic ring after a big hit occasionally but it isn't a bad sound i actually kind of like it. the sub was extremely easy to hook up and get wired in, the only problem i ran into was getting passed my anti theft deck. The port on the front improves the clarity a lt and the design is kick ass this is deffinetly a good buy for the price. i just wish shipping was cheaper >.&lt .
Everything was great as far as fast service, price, etc. The only problem I had was that the color is mire maroon and not pink like in the picture. Wish I'd of known. My daughter loves pink so I hope she still likes this one .
Great motivational book. Steve writes in very easy to understand concepts. Can't wait to start putting these principles into action .
We've ordered pieces from Sauder before, but this was was really junky. We had to order replacement parts twice because they kept arriving all scratched up. Pieces are not packed well. After we built it, it looks like the shelves are way too small for the cabinet. There is all kinds of space on either side of the shelves.I'd avoid this .
Boxes were shipped from manufacturer, not retailer. They were originally &#34;placed on the wrong truck.&#34; and were three weeks late arriving. When they arrived, there was a huge gash in the box. Only after taking the base out could we see that the gash cracked the back panel. The retailer we ordered through, Moshya, was very unhelpful. We really wanted the piece, so we kept it. We just have to be very careful of what we put under the seat. Blankets and jackets get snagged where the crack is.Otherwise, looks nice. I'd probably rate it higher if ours arrived on time and undamaged .
I guess I got what I ordered. Thankfully, I didn't pay a lot for it. I wanted to put it into a case, but the pin is clumsy and bulky .
They are roomy. Kids took all their stuff to camp easily. One bag already has a hole though, so not sure how they'll last for next year .
I got this primarily to wear under my shirt, to carry my CCL and a CCL badge my kids got me. Unfortunately it doesn't fold flat, and bulges way too much under my shirt to be any use. You can only really wear this on the outside .
The holster is way too tight for my Glock 19. I can squeeze it into the holster, but when I try to pull it out, the whole holster comes with it. Not good at all. The holster is molded from one solid piece of plastic, and is sewn together. No way to stretch it out. If they put some elastic in place of the stitches, maybe I could use it .
Just downloaded so not sure needed a hint so I had to rate this to get the free hint  so I not sur and nreed to type 20 words .
Item came VERY quickly. 5/5 on delivery time, especially so close to Christmas using the free delivery! Item is in wonderful shape. No frays or discolorations. The pictures are all brilliantly colored and high detailed aside from the darker one, which is usually covered anyways so I can overlook it. Material is good quality for the price. If you're considering this product, I recommend it.Ignore the rating bit, I always rate accordingly and...for some reason it believes the wallet is a toy and therefore wants to know how educational and fun it is...both of which would be 1/5 >_>TL;DR :Great productGreat imageryHighly recommend .
it's so good.My thoughts about it are stars I can't fathom into constellations it's so good. READ THIS BOOK .
Still trying to figure this product out. The product is ok when I really need it to work it won't we charge it every night and it will work for 1 or 2 uses, but then it fizzles out.we have a German shepherd /Rottweiler mixed so she's a pretty big dog. I couldn't wait for this item to come in and I was thrilled that it work so well at first, but like I said after the second use it didn't faze her the power was weak. We keep trying because she hates to hear the warning beep she will back off which is good I hate to do any thing to her but if she needs it I want it to work, but I can't rely on it .
I was suicidal when I went looking for something and found these, I'm fat and now I know that eating healthy and exercising for fun are all I need, not the BS advertising companies have bribed the health industry and brainwashed stupid Joe Blow into telling me .
Fat Chicks Rule and Fat!So? changed my life - saved it even. I was suicidal when I went looking for something and found these, I'm fat and now I know that eating healthy and exercising for fun are all I need, not the BS advertising companies have bribed the health industry and brainwashed stupid Joe Blow into telling me. Marilyn Wann rocks .
Just finished reading  Christmas Grace.  Couldn't put it down.  A well written story with well defined characters and story line.  You could tell exactly what each character was feeling but you could not anticipate how the story was going to play out.  You laughed when they laughed, cried when they cried but always kept wondering what was going to happen next.  I would recommend this book to those who love a good romance or good stories about the lives of every day people .
This book taught me imagination. I still have a copy of it and can't wait to share it with my first granddaughter .
I loved the story...the only thing I did not love about it was how they separated it into 6 volumns just to get you to pay 2.97 for what was just a book .
Very touching! I can't wait to read more like this book. I Love family books about falling in love. Great book .
Nothing bad about it. If you like simple, and you wanna show the color if your iPod I'd buy it. Just took a little long to get it, but it's worth it. Very slim .
I LOVE IT. First, service was amazing! I made these especially for my boyfriend and I, but I got the date wrong on my dog tags so I emailed them right away! Sure thing, they sent me another pair with the right information. Second, the company is so nice and they really do a GREAT job. I can't wait to give the dog tags to my boyfriend. Shipping is great!  YOU WONT REGRET IT .
As skimpy and nice this costume is, it is extremly hot! You wouldn't think that with a costume. The material sticks to you and creates alot of body heat. Normally I freaze my butt off in anything I wear so its not me. But overal it fits very nicely and skirt is not too short .
It is smaller than I expected. And less durable. The knives are sharp but the light flickers on and off at times. Would not buy again .
Loving the photos I am able to capture from this!!  Sharp, clear images with great color.  Wonderful purchase, I couldn't be happier .
We spend enough on the camera and lenses, why wouldn't you take good care of it??  Plus YouTube has wonderful videos to help you through the process .
I have returned this item three times and everytime I get it there is something wrong with the box or something is cracked and this last time the box was bent but I'm keeping it because I'm sick of having to send it back and wait. It's not the post office it's factory flaws .
Does not let you pick the contestants row.  coins  you pick the first coin gives you the second one.  Out of three coins and so on .
I downloaded this app and I couldn't get on the internet with this. This is not a good app. Don't get it .
I didn't like the what this app has. I was looking for an app I can do all kinds of different editing .
Good update for news about Lady Gaga. Now I'm sure I do not miss anything this time!Updated more time in a day .
I ordered this using my prime and I couldn't be happier. All of the Part Stores around town wanted to charge double and have me wait for two days while they ordered it. I would purchase this product again .
I just started using this product. I really hope it Will work bcus I have something called Hormonal Acne and I've tried everything. Nothing works, I've heard good things about this product. ..it's really cheap at Costco if I may say so.I'm trying it out .
I have had a the same G100 for years, worn as a work watch in really dirty, rough and tumble industrial environment...at the end of the day just shower with it on, scrubb it down and the next day start all over again.  I have worn out several bands which I just replace and good as new.  I like the analog dial along with the easily viewable digital display, as well as the easily accessible stop watch mode, which I use reqularly... for the price... very impressed with the durability and accuracy of this watch, just wear it, use it, scrub it down at end of the day and your good to go again. I have found no issues with its ability to with stand substances within an industrial atmoshere...oils, fuel oil, grease of all types, dust, mud,  solvents, submerged in water, heat, hot and cold weather and never seen the vapor fogging under the bezel that I have seen on other watches in such extreme environments... the bezel glass is still perfect, not all scratched up and foggy, due mainly because it is protected by the high rubber bezel ring surrounding it...The only issue I would comment on is the cost of the replacement G Shock bands, little pricey for a $60 watch, but not as thought you have to replace them reqularly... maybe every few years at most..but definitly the only weak link in the system, IMHO .
I purchased the Monsoon Gearslinger as a handy pack that I could carry on short outting and in the truck as a emergency bag if need be on long road trips...and for this use it has worked well. I am a big fan of Maxpedtion and their fine line of durable and well thought out bags, backpacks and pouches of all types are fine products...I have used this pack on several short 10 mile hikes and to attend all day events like festivals, sporting events and shooting matches..it has worked well. The pack rides comfortably over your shoulder and generally stays in place, well constructed, amble pockets with many internal and external achoring points and conpartments,very quickly removed and remounted, items are easily eccessible within the intercompartment. Once again Maxpedition has not let me down...its not a perfect all purpose pack but for quick excess, short hike or day outing as well as bag to throw in the vehicle slung over the seat works very well .
I have the medium and the large Rollypoly and use them on reqular bases, both have proven tough and convenient pouches. The roll up feature is very desirable,I believe its best feature, besides its very good construction.  I do not use the pouch very often in a traditional dump pouch function, attached to my belt or gear, but just as a compactable pouch to carry in my shooting bag to collect brass or carry gear while moving between stages in match environment.  The pouch has reinforced vents in the bottom and will stand upright by itself, if the wind is not to strong, with a few items in the bottom has no trouble with up right open use. Its sort of promoted as a dump pouch to be worn for magazine dumping, and can be used for this, though mounting variety is limited (thus only gave it 4 stars, gets 5 starts for durablilty and folding compact storage)..really, lest for me, it is just a tough, strong, well thoughtout folding, compact pouch that somehow is very useful for a variety of handy uses...in fact many many many times during events shooters ask me &#34;where did you get that pouch&#34; , &#34;who makes that&#34;  after I show them how it folds up..&#34; have to get one of those, now who makes it?&#34 .
Garcinia Cambogia extract pure max 3000mg this product didn't work for me, didn't lost weight, is expensive and don't do anything, so bad, don't like me .
My daughter won't even wear it because it's too uncomfortable.  Also, the sizing is not accurate.  It is much too big .
I have been adamant about losing at least 40 pounds since the start of the new year. I saw the details for this and thought that it could help me to start losing weight again . My goal was to lose a total of 55 lbs which I've been trying to lose . Before I stopped losing weight I had lost a total of 21 pounds. I hit a plateu of course but am now seeing pound for pound drop. No jitters for me was a plus .
OMG - the grandson loves this app.  I can't play my own games when he's around because I constantly hear, &#34;my turn&#34;LOL .
My husband and I don't normally order things on-line, but when I seen this Bible and the price, I knew I wanted it for our oldest son. I was surprised when we opened the package (which arrived way earlier than expected, another plus) that it was exactly how it was described on-line. We were certainly pleased with our order and will definitely order again .
This boot fits true to its size. It's not too heavy but yet it keeps my feet dry and warm. I haven't used them in snow for hours at a time yet so I may revise this review after that.They are a nice boot to throw on with leggings because they aren't super heavy duty but they have enough fashion flare to wear them casually.The boots were exactly as pictured and shipped 1 day ahead of schedule. I would recommend these boots to others .
Does not stay in controller falls out constantly the batteries are hard to remove from the battery pack and you can tell the difference from a normal battery pack .
The analog sticks don't move well when you install them, they stick when you move them they don't return to proper position after you move them on the contorller .
Cute Peanuts book! I only wish I would have known that it's not totally appropriate for younger children, since the pop-up eggs in it could easily be torn out and eaten by curious little people! Cute story, though, just one that you will need to monitor younger children with as they read .
Cute toy, my son loves it! Expect the paint to chip and fade quickly, however. Wooden toys don't stay nice in the hands of kids! Otherwise, a great purchase and well-loved toy .
I am really disappointed in this product. It arrived utterly damaged. The decals/paint on the beads had mostly rubbed off and stuck to everything else (the tree base, other beads, everything), making a huge mess. Not only that, but it doesn't seem well-suited for a child to play with at all. Needless to say, I will be sending it back .
My grandmother gave me this book while I was on bed rest when I was pregnant with my son. and I have to say John saul book "The Right hand of evil" kept me enterained. It was my first book of his that i've read and I absolutely loved reading it. I am now reading "When the wind blows" and love that book as well. If you are considering reading this book I promise you won't be dissapointed .
I have got this product which is too large. Now they are saying it to give it someone else and they will refund only 80%. Isn't it pathetic.. What a smart way to sell the product. I am going nuts with this as it has screwed my all the plans .
i love it! it actually works too. it wasn't like reflective paper. it was nice not to have to think if i brought my mirror w/me, that i could just whip my fone out real quick n be done.  very useful invention for women!! it came in a couple days too. thanks .
Got this way before they said I would. Works great on my 22lr. This is not some cheap plastic it is metal. Locks in good also .
Tuck so long to get to my house. It was not even funny, then after waiting for so long it came in And it was broke. Very unhappy. Don't know if they are sending me another one or not. But I'm very unhappy .
Bought this for my daughter and she could not put it down. In one day she produced two beautiful zentangle  designs and easily picked up the technique. She is hooked and is excited to learn more .
I bought this for my daughter who is beginning to learn zentangle along with an instructional book .I like how everything she draws will be in this book and not have loose papers everywhere .
This is the funnest car and little girls with bows in their hair look great driving it.Our one year old granddaughter can't stop playing with it even if she is too small to actually drive it.Received it faster through Amazon than a local toy store .
They can be worn anywhere,so fun!No fear of mud in these high tread shoes. So easy to put on and take off yet snug when worn.I can't garden without them .
When you own roses you are always replacing your gloves. These are great in the war of not getting stuck by thorns .
I take this every day and definitely helps with my digestion. It should not be used to lose weight it's mostly to help you with the constipation .
This book has made me feel so much better! Ive been through a lot of testing to figure out whats wrong with me. I was terrified I had MS.. I started this diet because my blood tests showed I had inflammation and I figured it could only help. My chronic pain and cramping began to disappear. I lost 12 lbs in the first 10 days! The only complaint I have is that its a hard program to stick to 100%. I made a few minor tweaks to the recipes and gained. But as soon as I got back on it I dropped the gained weight quickly .
The way it's written is just beautiful. She brings you into these people's lives and makes you part of their journey. You will rejoice with their accomplishments and cry throughout their disappointments and heartbreaks. Not once did I lose interest in this book. I have taken the characters into my life and that is a show of a passionate writer. I thank you for the privilege of being invited to read this work of art. Can't wait to read the next book .
This is the best book that I have read in two months and I read a lot. As a matter of fact this is the first book I have been inspired to write a review for. First of all I'm pretty savvy at figuring out the plots to these stories and although I was on the right track I didn't see it going exactly  the way it did. This book was incredibly intriguing, it kept me interested at every turn, I read it straight threw. Would love to read his POV. I don't put my stamp of approval on just anything but I will be sharing this author's work .
I had tinea versicolor really bad on my stomach and arms. It was embarrassing and nothing seemed to help at all. But this, take my word for it, you will not regret it. This stuff had visual improvements on my skin in a 24hour span. For having this nasty skin issue for over 6months, of say this thing is worth every penny!  I urge you to try this!  2-3 sprays at least twice a day on the area of your skin and you will be better in no time .
The T-Core is an amazing way to add bulk to your abdominals since it is a resistance weighted piece of equipment.  You will not get amazing abs using this alone, unless you do at least like 3 different exercises till failure using little to no resistance to burn fat.  It is a good thing to add to your already existing ab workout!  However, this requires the activation of your core, which I'm sure most people are not understanding when buying this.  What I mean is; form is key in using this.  Most people will just lean forward and back or use their arms to pull the T-Core down and up.  That is completely wrong and why I believe anyone who has put a bad review down has done.  You need to only move your core and abs, nothing else.  It's much like a cable crunch or normal crunch.  Bend your core and abs, they should be doing all the work .
This product is by far the most amazing capture card ever made in my opinion.  It is so easy to get started, record, and finalize a clip before saving it into a file.  No hassles or inconveniences, just 100% perfect.  Works great with Mac and I know it works with PC as well.  Records beautiful 1080p HD on my Xbox360 and the program for it is so simple and user friendly, this is truly a gift to the gaming community.  If you aren't satisfied with my review, check out my YouTube video on the out of box testing using Halo 4!Search: RicherFilmz on YouTube!!!Titled: elgato Game Capture HD - Halo 4 Style .
Says &#34;does not support this accessory&#34; and now it a piece of garbage.  Be warned before you buy, the iPhone doesn't allow charging with it .
Gave this to my nephew for Christmas and he loved this guy. Both of his parents snowboard so he was excited about this guy, and it was one that he didn't have .
I purchased this for my 80-year-old father so he could wear it 24/7 (takes blood thinner). He has almost lost it several times as the clasp keeps coming open and the bracelet slips off. Most times, he doesn't even know he's lost it. I had a jeweler tighten the clasp as much as they could but it still catches on things which pulls the clasp open.  A better, more secure clasp would give this bracelet 5 stars as it is very attractive and a good solid weight .
SPOILERS INCOMING!!!It was a great book but a bit disappointing compared to all the other books because Artemis had the Atlantis complex and he so he wasn't coming up with his normal schemes and half the time he wasn't even Artemis he was that Orion guy who was really weird. All in all it just wasn't quite as intriguing as some of the previous books .
I love this product! Yes the sizes are strange but if you can find a size that fits its great to use. I started using one on my redbone coonhound and it worked perfectly and he liked it better because it didn't have the strap over his muzzle. So when my boston terrier started getting a luxating patella her pulling all the time didn't help. I didn't want to use the normal gentle leader on her because bostons tend to have eye problems and the strap would cause more pressure on her eyes. Today I received her harness and its such a joy to walk her now. she's only 20lb but all muscle with the harness she is no longer dragging me around. This product is worth every penny .
excelente articulo, excelente vendedor muy puntual y cumple con las especificaciones solicitadas ! ! ! &#60;3 muy bueno gracias .
Probably my favorite book ever. I can't wait to read more. I can't wait for the movie too! So excited .
I liked the case when I first received it.  It looks different from the usual cases and has a touch of bling.  However, the case does not stay in tact for long.  The edges started to fray, and the front orange flap is separating from the black backing.  This separation started happening after the first week or two of using it.  I predominately keep my phone in my purse or on a table (wherever I am).  So, it is not getting bounced around a lot.  I suppose I could glue it back down, and see how long that holds up.  I started cutting the extra white strands that periodically stick out around the edges.  But, I have to keep doing this because more strands come out.  I will shop for a more durable case next time .
This 2013 calendar includes some of his very best, well-knwon works, and also some pieces I wasn't familiar with yet .
Love the options.  It has never, not worked properly.  This alarm clock app is very user friendly.  I have downloaded this app on all of my devices. I would recommend you do the same .
I've read almost all of the Alex Cross series over the years and generally find them to be a fun, relaxing read. There are twists and turns in this one, but the outcomes are predictable.  This was not as intense as many of the others, especially some of the early books, but it was still an enjoyable read .
I bought these just to have an extra pair but one of the ear buds didn't even work when I received it .
Liked this nail polish but for the cost it doesn't really last long. If you use it as a top glitter coat it's fine but to use it as a solid shimmer takes up to eight coats .
Drop once about five feet and completely shattered. Very cute case and shipped quicker than expected. Would not use if you're scared of shattering screen .
Charged really slow. Took forty minutes to charge 7%. Not worth the money or the wait. It also fit very snug .
I received a whole pack where the stickers were stuck together. Not worth the wait to get sent to you .
This was truly a beautiful purchase - the seller could not have been more accommodating and even tailored the bracelet for me! The bracelet is really well-done and the stones are just lovely. Thank you so much !!! Excellent customer services!!Keeping my finger cross :- .
very handy can't beat the price wish there were more music production terms but overall a good handy thing to have .
just as advertised couldn't really be more happy with this product its a bit pricey but that aside it works looks and feels great .
best controller for reason that is on the market the faders and knobs feel great and the lcd screen and keybed are the best not to mention the motorized fader great job by nektar .
This laptop never worked properly from the beginning.  I thought it was due to my infamiliarity with windows 8, but that ended up not being the case.  My wife and I run nothing too complex...Pictures, excel, word, PPT, web surfing.  Eventually the computer slowed down and we took it to the Best Buy Geek Squad.  They were good and did what they could, but it ended that a new hard drive was required.  I know a hard drive is not expensive, but I figure why throw more money at a machine that sucked when it was new?Note: I have a different Lenovo for work that works like a champ .
Omg, this book was amazing. I couldn't put it down, the text is incredibly raw yet impossible to put down. Must read .
a little awkard to use. doesn't shutdown the kindle when you close it. would have preferred a different kind of closure .
Cannot get all the air bubbles out. When using the included piece of cardboard, the protector has scratches on it and still has air bubbles .
Looks exactly like the picture. not very protective, but very fashion forward. so glad i found it. i love it .
I actually needed a metal-toothed comb for my long cosplay wigs. This works great, and I don't regret purchasing it .
The rings arrived fast, and they are of great quality for cosplaying. I LOVE Katekyo Hitman REBORN, it is one of the best animes I will ever watch. All of the rings were excellent, and despite the first look, the Storm and Lightning ARE different. If you'll note the close differences. I didn't expect them to arrive in such an adorable case as well! I wanted to say thank you very much .
I like this game because I can have the fun of playing video games while moving my body. Who doesn't like dancing when nobody is looking .
The figurines were all good, their faces were properly painted. They are the perfect size. Most of them fit into their stands... One of the black sticks didn't fit into the stand. Otherwise, the figurines themselves are very nice .
The size chosen for me from their sizes fit perfectly. The sleeve length and body length of the coat are perfect. It arrived ahead of expected delivery time, I am very happy about that! The ONLY thing wrong with the product was that the actual thing was 2 shades darker than advertised. Colour perfection is not a priority of mine, because I am happy so long as I can tell what the cosplay is with a  glance. However, if colour accuracy is a priority of yours, then so be it. I LOVE my new cosplay, thank y'all so much .
I always have it in my iPad mini when I am not listening to music. The paint is not messed up, and the cat is very cute. Thanks .
Not that small at all. It's well made and light. Decent replica for the price.It looks really good, and can be used as a letter opener .
This hair was horrible. It matted really bad. This hair also contains dye because when you wash it, the water turns black. DO NOT purchase from this vendor .
The lights were not very bright other than that they are ok I really liked the blue lights that were ordered now they are noticeable .
Terrible doesn't even deserve a star. It's not even meant to fit the 5c phone if you have a screen protector . Got dirty with in one day .
Great product!! Sticks on forever!! Would recommend it to everyone if you want a really long term sticker. Not even really like a sticker because it stays on SOO long .
I was looking forward to getting slouch socks. Dissappointed. Three are way too small, so I got a pair and a half. Plus I really wanted 100% cotton, but I guess not available .
I love the song, and the download has no issues.  What I did have an issue with was that this track has way to many beeps in it.  I didn't realize that I should have looked for a listing with 'explicit lyrics'.  Perhaps if the 'explicit lyrics' track had been listed with the one I actually got, it would have been better.  Thanks for listening .
This book is so amazing no matter whaat other people say this book is just something especial and its so my theme .
I was given these as a gift and can't wait to use them.  I love the soft feel and the cute design .
Overall I'm pretty happy with this coat. Past reviewers commented that the wool was scratchy, or low quality. Yes, it's scratchy, but not terrible. To be honest, when compared to other wool items that I have, it is pretty smooth. It has a smooth felted feel to it, which is perhaps why past reviewers didn't like it? (It isn't fuzzy soft, or lambswool - it's more like a &#34;motor coat&#34; kind of wool.) The quality is about what I expected for the price. The wool isn't super thick, which I appreciate, so the &#34;skirt&#34; of the coat drapes fairly well. It's warm, windproof, probably not the coat I'd want for sub-zero temperatures, but great for cool brisk November days in Oregon. I liked the studded sleeves better than I expected, they stand out more on the actual coat than they do in the photo, and they add a nice feminine touch. I love the gray color.  Now for the less than ideal... it's not quite as structured as I thought it would be, and it bunches up a little around the waist. The arms could be a little longer but I always have trouble getting coats with long enough arms. I'm 5'8 and ordered the small, but wonder if I should have gotten the extra small - the shoulders fit, but as I mentioned there is a little bunching of some extra fabric around the waist. That seems to always be the trade-off- enough room in the shoulders, or a nice tailored look around the middle. When all is said and done, this coat is a little bulkier than it looks in the photo, but I still like it. I'm keeping it, and in the few times I've worn it, I've gotten a lot of compliments .
I haven't finished the book, but it is very informative and enjoyable to read.  A lot of time and research was devoted to writing this book...loved it .
The service was great.  Shipped and received quickly.  The socks look very nice and are of high quality.  They don't look any different then very nice dress socks .
I met someone that was wearing nice cologne.  She told me that this was the kind she was wearing, however, I purchased it and wore it and do not believe that it has the same smell as the cologne she was wearing.  The cologne is nice and was as described, I just do not personally like the scent.  On the upside you only need to use a tiny bit .
I bought another since my older mop died and I hate the thought of being without it.  This is a fantastic product.  Unfortunately the one I purchased was not working and I had to return it.  I have since purchased another new one .
This product was recommended by a physician assistant for providing relief for nerve pain.  I haven't had the opportunity to try it yet, but it was new, shipped promptly and I can't wait to use it .
I was recommended to use these by my physician.  For minor joint arthritis pain/aching this is just like a little miracle in a box.  I put a patch on before bed and take it off when I wake up...no more pain, fabulous .
Eco Friendly Dog Pet Waste bags are ecofriendly and do not leak! I recommend buying them to pick up after your pet .
I have been using this product for years.  I recommend it highly. It lifts and firms around the eyes and  I see an instant difference when my eyes are puffy.  I've used other products with no results.  Everyone's tissue is different and not every product works the same way.  This product works great for me .
I really love this watch! It is simply and classy. Also, it is great that it never needs a battery! This will be my everyday timepiece .
it's a little smaller than expected, Must be mounted properly to really work well. The assembly only came with pictures no instructions but pretty easy to figure out .
First of all the item arrived way before the due date which was very nice of Amazon. The phone is really great.. Although there is no wifi, 3g works just fine.. There are different apps that can be downloaded. I do not mind using a touch screen since its easier to text on this phone .
I was a little reluctant to buy these beads because there was no one to review it before. But these beads were really nice on a chain and I hope to buy more in future .
A friend of mine urged me to download this book onto my Kindle/tablet, going on and on about how the Elizabeth series is so good. I read it just to get her off my back when I spoke with her next. Reluctantly, I sat down on my lunch hour and read it cover to cover, loosing track of all space and time. I was completely and utterly converted to this author and this series. Vivid imagery and a plotline which draws the reader in from the first paragraph through to the very last word--a quick and satisfying read. I could not wait to get the box set with the whole series so that I can find out what happens next. I am hooked! A fun and exciting breathe of fresh air .
This is perfect for my room filled with skulls and what not~Came in good condition; no chips or anything, but it was a little dusty.c .
It's really pretty & glitteryit came pretty fast as well :)the packaging wasn't damaged at all.very pleased with it .
Oh my gosh~I just got it in the mail today and it is absolutely adorable and you can't go wrong for it being 4.24 c:It took a little while to get to me but I didn't mind waiting.So happy with my purchase! :D .
I had 3 packs so farand it is one of the cutest things i've ever seen!it came pretty fast the first time I ordered one, but I didn't mind waiting a little more for the other two .
I am sooooo so glad I bought this!I needed an umbrella for quite some time and I couldn't find the right one for me until I saw this little cutie and I knew I had to get it :]a very good price. 10/10 .
It is really soft & adorable :)Came in good condition; no fuzzies all over it or anything.A good price for it as well .
It was as expected.I liked it very much. It was usefull for me and not expensive at all. I recommend it .
Since this book arrived  not a day has gone by without its pages being turned.  Our three grandboys love it as much as we do and have googled to find out more about many of the trees.  I am using it for inspiration for art quilts and the designs, colours and textures are invaluable.  I would highly recommend it.  It is a very special book indeed .
This product is the best hair care I have ever used.  My hair went from straw to silky within weeks.  I have never had as many compliments on my hair in my life.  The copy-cat version of this shampoo leaves your hair flat & dull looking Stick to WEN and you will be a WEN girl forever .
I'm so sorry to write this comment, but this dress really let me down, never wear in winter, it is warm now, start to wear a week,  clothes SLV.opening and bottom cuff had a lot of hair bulb ball!!!,It is defective!!!(Ihave pictures .
THIS IS FOR A SINGLE ENVELOP!! NOT FOR 20 OR 25! PLEASE READ THE &#34;Item Package Quantity&#34; FOR ACCURATE INFORMATION .
Did not notice any changes while taking it for six weeks and would not recommend this product to a friend .
Perfect for my mood. Love da lyrics as well the tunes. can't wait for more, keep it up. &#34;Trust in the Lord with all thine heart&#34 .
the printer is fine. the problen is with yield of the tonner, no one cannot help me with the yielding. I want to buy a high yieldig tonner, no one knew it, prety bad .
I prefer the electronic copy because the paper copy has never arrived before the start of the period. The January copy was due in December as at 14Mar13 has not arrived. I will recomend that all subscribers at Our Lady of the Pines Donvale us this method .
this fan is sturdy, holds my computer at the proper angle and the blue lights are cool too... its a shame it had to break so soon. within the first week of receiving it one of the three fans quit, but i continued to use it with only two fans remaining. however within four months it was completely broken and nothing but a cheap plastic computer stand. if you are looking for something functional i suggest you spend only a few dollars more as this is too cheap to last for any reasonable amount of time .
Not what I was expecting.  The five charging cords don't work. Happy with the camo phone case. And happy with screen protectors .
Kit means more then one item the only thing that came was the remote did not ,one I had one just needed sensor .
Power cord would not plug into. It would fit into the x box 360 just fine , but with no power to, it ,itis worthless .
Did not think I would like it ,but work great 2 dollar buy still works after 6 weeks of hard playing .
love the colors, matches the cover on the book. can't wait til it gets warm out and i can wear it. would recommend it to every hunger games fan .
these lights were just what i was looking for, they were perfect for my project. they don't get hot either. shipping was fast. i like them so well i just ordered another set for another project im doing. thank you. i would highly recommend the lights .
only one thing wrong with the set, the pieces on the ends won't stay on, ive lost one due them coming off all the time. pen writes nice. they are a nice set for a collector .
Finally a coffee that doesn't keep me awake!  I'm a coffee lover and couldn't have coffee past 3pm if I wanted to fall asleep that night.  I can't tell you how thankful I am that someone out there finally came out with this coffee!!  And it tastes lovely!  I wish it was around 10 years ago .
It's a shame that a perfectly intelligent writer had to write such a piece of Rubbish.  To call the leading Conservative voice in the United States, a man who fights for States Rights, equal opportunity, equal treatment under the law, and for conservative fiscal and foreign policy a Nazi shows not only a blind contempt for the man, but ignorance of history, particularly concerning Third Reich policy .
The quality seems pretty good. I ordered two of these for my sons outdoor birthday party to make it easier which it did come in handy so the wind didn't blow the roll. As far as making it easier to pull the paper towel off with one hand I'm not so sure about. At first it seemed to work pretty well. But overall I'm satisfied with them and use them a lot over the summer outside for our cookouts .
We have had this base installed for about a month now but the bathroom remodel isn't finished yet so we haven't been able to use the shower. It looks nice and the quality seems pretty good. Delivery took awhile but being such a large size the local stores didn't stock it .
Putting it together was easy but the quality isn't that great. I thought I would really like the double bar but without having it sideways you really can't see the clothes on the back row. The bars are adjustable so I have the front bar all the way down and the back bar up high so I can have it against the wall. I ended up having a closet built so I use this rack at our Pawn Shop and seems to work well there .
So far I like the case. It seems light and convenient compared to the previous cases I had for my old iPad. I do wish it had a screen protector built into the case. I haven't really traveled much with this one yet but the iPad Air and this case are definitely easier and lighter in my purse then the old one .
This app won't open on my Kindle Fire HD. At. All. Grrrrr! I did try the Farm Frenzy 2 and it did open. It's fun .
I have really enjoyed playing this game; however, it keeps crashing on me! In between levels or at the end of levels (not usually in the middle of one) it shuts off and goes back to my home screen. Not the worst thing ever but still frustrating. The game itself is very entertaining and engaging .
From the photo, I thought this watch was made of links and had a clasp. The watch actually is just a band and has a buckle. I think it makes it look a little bit cheaper than what I'd hoped for, but it's still nice. It's just a simple, everyday watch to wear. I got it for my boyfriend for his birthday, I think he will like it. He's the kind who would beat up his watch quickly by working, so I was afraid it wouldn't be durable enough, but I think it is. Definitely not a watch that you would want to wear with a suit .
If you need high quality, affordable screen protectors, then look no further. They are the cheapest ones I found on Amazon and there's three of them! Perfect .
This case came very quickly, within four days of the order. However, the color is not true to the image, in the photo there is a lot bright yellows and oranges which is not at all the way it actually looks. The design is correct, but it looks like a pressed on plastic film to a plastic green case... and the green is not as bright as it is in this picture. Also, I don't know if it was just the luck of the draw on the case I got, but the front piece doesn't even fit my phone, it's too small! Not happy with this product at all, and I have bought plenty of phone cases from here before .
I ordered this book not for me but for a friends since i don't like anything by ellen hopkins (don't jump on me for saying that) but the book came new and didn't have any marks or anything so thanks .
Love the cables, not as long as i hoped them to be but that's my fault since i didn't know how high 6 feet was (I'm a girl) but the cables are nice, don't feel cheap, and doesn't break so easily like the cables i buy at walmart. Really good service, especially for a penny .
I got this in the mail in 3 days and hate it. It won't let me play any games on ps2 even if i download it onto my ps3 and its a wired joystick. The picture is of a wireless joystick not wired. If i had know it was a wired joystick i wouldn't have bought it. It also feels like really cheap plastic. But otherwise on the actually performance on ps3 games its ok, no dual-shock though which sucks. But for the price it was at i will give you 3 stars .
I got the item and its very cool but you have to be careful because its very fragile. I put a bunch of music on it and plugged it into my cars usb and it couldn't read it. I have never heard of different types of usb software but im sure ill figure it out. Like I said though,its not to be played with like a toy .
This bracelet is sweet. Like one of the other reviews said,you do have a hard time fitting the pin in the holes but after some use its no problem .
Beautifully written and a personal private joy when someone uses words I actually have to look up! Reading a great story and learning along the way is the best storytelling there is. There is no rehashing of old stories here. It is truly a new and fresh way to enjoy monsters and amazing characters .
Really a great read and thankfully not a full on love story. It was pretty well written except a few areas toward the end the paragraphs got a little confusing as to who's side you were reading about. I genuinely enjoyed the fact to that this starts after the wars and doesn't drag you thru anything but the necessary and important ones .
My husband's tablet was able to do this without an app and I was so jealous that I couldn't do it on my Toshiba or the Fire so I'm beyond excited to have an app now! It works flawlessly and is fantastic when watching movies...no more missed calls .
This thing is awesome! Very easy to clean and maintain. Makes great tasting coffee/tea and or hot chocolate. The extra water reservoir is great. Can't go wrong with this one .
We've been using this system for about 2 years now. It's easy to maintain affordable and very clean. The cats prefer it over the standard cat litter and box. Ordering thru Amazon with auto ship has been a blessing, we've never run out of pads or the litter pellets .
bad quality, not for big toes, especially if you're an adult man. might work for women if they have small feet .
I was not expecting the end of the book to be so fast and quick to happen. I wish the ending had of been a little more drawn out but it was a good read .
These shoes are a hit whenever I wear them.  They started to slide a bit but inserts fixed the problem.  They make your legs look amazing .
I'ma tech fan , so anything I buy that has todo with him I love. Great live concert. never bought a video like this , but if you want to see a great live concert in the comfort of your home an your a tech fan than this is a must have for you. Well put together .
I gave the ratin g of 5 stars for several reasons. First it is a good size for a portable player, and fits in your hands comfortably. Second is the fact that it will play the regular DS games as well as the ones for the DS Lite. It is the only model that will play games for made for more than one model. The only thing I don't like is that it will not play all the newer games, but you can't have everything. In closing this is a well made system, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a fun inexpensive handheld video game system .
I love this charger. When your batteries are fully charged not only does it tell you but it stops charging them, it even turns itself off after 9 hours .
These are perfect for storing the spare batteries for my camera. The only thing that would make them better is if they didn't come attached to one another .
The Nerf Triple Armor lives up to it's name. I gave it 5 stars because it is just like a suit of armour for your DS. My daughter has dropped hers several times with no damage. This is the second case and second DS we have bought her. The first one broke (both the case and the DS) that we have bought her. It is a little more bulky than a normal case but cushions the DS well. It was easy to install and works for several different models. In closing this case is an excellent investment towards keeping your DS safe from damage caused by a drop, and I would recommend it for everyone .
This is a very good coffee. It is strong enough that you get a nice flavor without it being bitter. It is very smooth. I must admit that I like Emerill's a little better, but for the price it can't be beat. I have recommended it to my father in-law, and he likes it as well .
Not only does my wife like the color but she loves the way it attaches to her nook. It seems to be a quality made product that uses quality materials. It is so good that if I ever need to replace my cover we will see if they make one for my model of nook .
This is a very good mild coffee. I drink my coffee black, but I need a coffee that is easy on my stomach. This is a very nice mild not to bitter coffee .
Right from the start, the CD Player never worked. We tried it with a number of CDs.But it did not work. We are unable to use it .
The battery did not work and would not charge .
Very bad: the problem of this book is that it does contain a lot of symbols in formulas, and many times it doesn't explain their meaning. If there wasn't this problem it was worth 5 stars, but imagine a reader trying to guess what all these symbols mean(for example in Ward shading model). Writing a shader knowing what the symbols mean could be done in 10 minutes, but it takes even a week if you don't know what symbols mean. I guess how can the author think that we magically know what he means with all these symbols, how asinine .
Although this book may not appear as good as its brothers it is really important to link the story together its a bit like the 4 book it has a serious twist which may ruin it in some views .This book is brilliant for the Alex Rider fan club it may get to.your head but be patient it will make sense eventually .
The hobbits Is a never put down book. The greatest hit with the 13 dwarves Bilbo and Gandalf all telling a fantastic syory .
Excelente m&agrave;quina facil de usar y deja una acabado perfecto el envio fue r&agrave;pido, venedeor responsable, tiene infinidades de puntadas para bordados, no tengo ninguna queja sobre el producto la recomiendo .
It came in on time, and was not very expensive. The material fits comfortably, but those are the only good things about this purchase. I ordered a small and got a medium, there are no openings for me to put the buttons through (so the shorts don't button up, practically unwearable). Also, there was no return information to be able to send it back. A total waste of money .
Sorry folks........  This movie can be summed up with 3 words.......  Stupid,Borind and Dumb........  Like a prievious poster said "move along folks nothing to see here".......  Don't waste your time or money on this one .
Being a fan of most of the regular tatoo shows i thought i'd give this a try......  Love it!! Not only do you get to see the artists doing their work but you also get a idea for the business aspect of running a sucessful shop.....  seeing the transformation from a so-so business to a top of the line studio makes for some intertaining viewing......  Cool show.......  Would recommend .
I don't get all the bad rewiews on here..........  I mean this isnt acadamy award stuff but i found it a very intertaining somtimes funny little movie .
Quick, easy read.  Narrator's perspective is attention-grabbing.  I could not put it down!!!  Read all three books in a few days time .
This works well, easy to clean.  I use this at work for our keurig machine.  Does not leave grinds in cup .
This item is reasonably priced.  It works well.  This will not protect phone from cracking as it is not padded .
There&#8217;s nothing fancy about this product. It only has one elevation and is ideal for basic use. I do recommend .
This is my first trainer, so I&#8217;m not familiar with the noise level of other trainers. I know this one is very loud, so loud; I must turn the sound level on the TV very high to hear the TV. I have it in the garage, so it doesn&#8217;t bother anyone. I do not recommend this product if you are living around (apartment) or with someone .
Having heard about this tragedy before i also had many questions about how something like this could happen. When i saw the book i was drawn to read it. Reading Jackie's words and seeing the pain she went/ is going through made me realize to never take anything in life for granted. I cried through just about every chapter in this book. Its a tear jerker but once you pick it up you won't want to put it down .
it came in a box and when i opened it i was so satisfied with this order. i was worried that it might not be what i ordered because there was alot of reviews that said they got a different design and that it's not good but i got my headphones and it satisfied me. it looked just like the picture and the sound quality is great. love it .
only reason i gave one star is because NONE was not an option!I ordered an assortment pack of different size screens, and was sent 100 of the smallest ones instead. Seller never responded to attempted contact...  least I wasn't burned for much .
yea a few little wood chips but no big deal...  I was surprised at how large the bag is.. should last a very long time .
First, the only reason it gets one star is because ZERO is not an option!!Half the bag contains Myrrh (if thats what it is) so fine is like fine sand... the rest of the tiny pieces look like dirt.. can't see ANY RESIN at all in the bag...  looks NOTHING like other stuff I have!  stay clear of this stuff .
the burn pot is beautifully engraved and the wood coaster nice, but the top piece with the screen does not match. The burn pot is more of a engraved silver and black, the lid a plain uncleaned unpolished brass.. does not look like the product photo...  not a big deal I guess..  I give it four stars because of it .
I don't see what others are complaining about.. maybe I got lucky.  Lights right up with a single match and is odorless and ready to use within a few minutes. .. yea it smokes n stinks when first lit but not a big deal....  one piece burns around an hour and a half .
I picked up two of these cases, one was a gift and the other for a AR-15 with all the bells.. fits perfectly and the blood red velvet like  inside gently cradles your weapon.  tag says it floats too! tho I can't see how with a serious weapon. both are embroidered with  Zombie Hunter.. looks nice .
The quality is too general, I don't feel very good&#65292;Feeling a little short&#65292;Quality is really very general&#65292;It's not worth the price .
Well, yao also use, also don't know whether have effect, texture can still&#65292;Waiting for the use effect&#65292;Listen to the friend say is good .
It has an orange color, not red...I should have listen to the reviews .
its so cute!  Can't go wrong with Dr. Seuss.  This book keeps baby's attention... who knows maybe will help her learn her ABCs .
Made in the USA ! Finally a product for babies not made in china. My daughter likes to try new foods in this .
I love haba but for the price , not sure that the expected quality is there --- the stroller is great but the pillow/blanket / mattress are pretty cheap and lumpy. Tags say 'designed and quality of haba Germany' but do not explicitly state made in Germany.... Which leaves me thinking the fabric parts of this item were made at least in part in china , which is what I've been striving to avoid. The whole thing is supposed to be made in Germany but I've got my doubts about the fabric !  That being said, my daughter loves loves loves this stroller ! She uses it all of the time to help with walking. It's  very solid and durable , and came requiring minimal assembly.  It's really an adorable item and the stroller itself is heirloom quality. The stroller itself should get 5 stars but the cheap fabric knocks it down to a 4 star .
and touch and try to hold it.  it's cute, soft, and thankfully an organic piece, so I don't care how much baby chews on it .
My daughter loves this duck! She is 7 months and wants her duckie at all baths. It's cute and small. It doesn't sit upright , but it spends the bath in her mouth anyhow.  Be careful because it will get water in it- squeeze out the duck after each bath to avoid any issues.  Not made in china , hooray .
These are cute and reposition well--- I went through a few remove and re-sticks and have had no problems so far .
So relieved that this was made in USA, NOT CHINA, and that it comes with a 10 year warranty.  Very excited to try this out .
The fabric is soft, which is great.  It looks like in the picture there are fold overs at the hands to cover baby from scratching herself, but its just a regular sleeve cuff.  For some reason the buttons are placed oddly... there are open flaps between buttons as baby goes about her day.  The cut is very boxy.  Not a lot of length but a LOT of extra room width-wise in the body, arms, legs...  Would probably be perfect for a chubbier baby .
I read the mixed reviews and bought anyway.  Not as quality an item as I anticipated for the price.  keeping it but not blown away by it.  It is a very dim night light .
Our child did NOT want the commercial vitamin dropper we were trying to use.  She'd spit it out, throw it up, and get upset.  Using just one drop on the feeding surface is so much easier, and less stressful for all involved.  She doesn't even know she is getting her vitamin .
our daughter is long and I wanted something we could use for more than a few months.  This piece, while expensive, is not a purchase to regret.  Well made, soft and comfortable .
I understand that while pregnant, I'm not supposed to be doing the same things as I had been doing pre-pregnancy.... but.... I'm pretty disappointed in this series.  I purchased these DVDs because I love yoga and have been doing it 2-3 times a week for the last few years.  The yoga DVD was extremely disappointing.  I guess it would be okay for someone who is accustomed to a level 1 beginners yoga, but for those of us who like at least a little bit of a challenge (and to get at least a little sweat on!) this sequence  has nothing to offer.  I also tried the pilates and strength training... not impressed with those, either.  I could see these being good for someone used to a lower level of working out, but for those of us who appreciate even a minimum amount of challenge, this series is not a good fit .
Yikes. So sad that fisher price sold out and had this manufactured in China. Do you think that it's reasonably foreseeable that a baby will chew on this? Yeah, the manufacturer didn't think it was, because the cheaply painted portions of this remote are- wait for it- chipping ! And within 24 hours of giving this to my 9 month old. Have to take it away from her when I'm not on top of her watching her with it since I don't want her ingesting god knows what off of this thing. That being said , she absolutely loves the remote. I wouldn't buy again though.  I try to not buy things manufactured in China, when possible.  This purchase reinforces that decision .
Wish I could return these ! I opened the package , they are really cute but smelled toxic... I washed twice with tide detergent and now the seams are falling apart AND the leggings still smell like toxic chemicals! These will not be used.... Total waste of money .
but the pin that it came with has rhinestones on it.  The dress got snagged on the pin and pulled a bit.  This dress is PERFECT for your pregnant body if you  are going somewhere HOT, like an outdoor wedding.  Otherwise you will definitely want a slip or something underneath.  Its nearly sheer but not quite .
This overnight / carry on bag is just what I was looking for.  The bows are much more sturdy than they appear on the website.  Can't wait to use it .
For the price I expected a better quality.  This is a very thin dress. not well made or something that seems like it would withstand multiple washings .
its great I love to play  it on my kindle its much fun then on my phone the only thing that I don't like is the sound but other then that its an awesome game .
I have had so much trouble finding a case (that's not black) for my tab 2. This fits perfect and even the screen protector does to. Nice quality for an $8 case. Fits inside my tab sleeve for ten inches with the case cover .
Praying Medic is not just an example but he is a teacher as well. Solid teaching made simple. Hearing what and how others have been through stretching their capacity for God is more than inspiring it is motivating. He leaves you with that feeling this isn't so hard, I think I can do this. My capacity of faith has grown from reading and beginning to apply it more effectively in my own walk. A must read. Thanks, Praying Medic, for putting your heart between the covers .
I bought this board for my sister as a gift, and I wasn't expecting such quality. The board was so nice I used it more than her while I was visiting .
I'm a fan of spigen, I dropped a $100 on one of their Ipad cases before and I still use it till now. So I didn't hesitate to purchase a case from them for my GS4 and the case looked beautiful; people didn't even recognize the phone when it was on. but forward 3 weeks later and the rubber back started deforming due to the phone's heat. My headphones jack fit into the cut out so it only affected me when I'm at a friend's and using their speakers, so due to the plastic part being as fragile as most reviews say it eventually broke and now I have a phone without a case, thank you Spigen .
Keeps the baby food at a nice temperature for the baby to eat, I don't like using a microwave to heat food and this warms it just enough for her to eat, love it .
I couldn't put it down and when I had to, I couldn't wait to start reading again.  I'm looking very forward to book 2 .
absolutly love it....can't have enough quilting books......but this onetaught me a whole new way to make a quilt top....thank you .
It's another Brother for my sewing room.....still learning what it can do......have figured out how to use the gather function and have used that for a Christmas gift....really came out well......will continue to work with manual and machine until I know it better......had no problem learning how to thread it, which I feared......Brother took care of that with their design....piece of cake.....even for an older person .
I am still working on getting this program to work....I'm not very computer savy when it comes to these programs...  I followed instructions and got it downloaded but am unable to open up instructions....will have to call for assistance .
Absolutly love my brother sewing machine....I am 62 years old and my first sewing machine was a brother.......while I have has other machines throughout my life....I always go back to brother products........i have purchased a Brother Serger after this machine and am still learning what it can do........This company produces sturdy machines that are extremely easy to operate and service......I am not pricing  brother pe770 and looking @ the brother pr650....can't make up my mine how deep I'm going to plunge.....One of the best features of the HC1850 for me is that you can operate the on /off function on the machine without using the foot pedal.....I have problems with my legs and hips and constant use of the foot pedal is painful for me.....I can sew much longer with the switch on the machine....Thanks .
The Snugg does fit the iPad3 perfectly as advertised.  I love the hand strap and have used it several times for work (this was one of the features that led me to buy it).  Although I haven't used it yet, I also like that it has a stylus holder on it as well.  The case seems very durable and I would recommend it to others .
I didn't care for this book, I found it quite boring,  although I had wanted to read it for years and never had the opportunity, it just wasn't my kind of book .
I really liked this book, it went from family to family and kept you wanting to not put the book down, it was full of suspense wondering what would happen next .
I like this word game, sometimes I get a lot of letters that I can't use then I get frustrated, but overall this is a good game .
Not a lot of good stories this month  but maybe there is something wrong with me..  I will try it again .
The dress  itself is sweet I don't know how they match these pants to that dress not too good otherwise I'll buy again thank you .
THE PRODUCT NOT ARRIVE TO MY HOUSE!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WHERE IS IT !?  PLEASE CONTACTME URGENT!! PLEASE CONTACTME URGENT!! PLEASE CONTACTME URGENT!! PLEASE CONTACTME URGENT!! PLEASE CONTACTME URGENT .
Arrived early! I bought two of these for my partner and I. Everything we do is electronic as far as paper work goes, so we are either taking up a bunch of space between the iPad, tablet, phones, and tablet/iPad keyboards. We got these yesterday and plugged them in today and they are working great! The blue light that everyone is posting about really isn't a problem in the office. I was actually able to replace my power strip with a smaller one, so everything looks nice and tight and less of a mess. Thanks for the speedy service .
Educational and fun.. my 3 year old and my 5 year old play it all the time. They never get bored. Plenty of different puzzles to enjoy .
The Price of a Gift is  a super good book!!  The author did a great job with character description and the relationships! As I read I honestly felt like I was there with them. Very easy to follow, I couldn't stop reading! The author draws you in instantly!!  Great read for teens and older!!  I can't wait for the next one Ashley Drake!!!!  THANK YOU .
It's beautiful and even shinier and more sparkly in person. It seems like its good quality. I have only had it for a week. I am hoping the gold doesn't tarnish quickly .
This case offers great protection (I've dropped my phone dozens of times w this case and no phone damage yet) and it is sleek so my phone gets to stay thin and cute! The kickstand feature is convenient and snaps back into place magnetically .
No, the book does not include the access code. You have to purchase one from MyITLab. Mine was 88 bucks. It's still a pretty good price for the book itself though. If you take a course that requires this book then I think you'll like it. It's written to where it's easy to read, there's tons of interesting things to break the monotony of just reading. From what I've seen, none of it's hard to understand .
I'm somewhat &#34;new&#34; to the Sci-Fi/ Fantasy style books, (not new to reading in general by any means), and I thought that the &#34;Song Of Ice And Fire&#34; series was as good a place as any to start out. I would definatley reccommend reading it, but it you're just starting Sci-Fi/Fantasy books like I was, you should start out with something a little bit more light. And I don't mean figuratively either. The book is LONG. Maybe not long as compared to other books of this genre, but long nontheless. If you do decide to read it, have the next book close in hand for when you finish .
Well written, just as the previous book. I loved this one just as much as the first. I look forward to reading the next one, but for now I'm giving myself some time to read some other books ;) They're just so looonnnng :P Maybe not for some of you, but hey, it was worth it .
I've read every single one of David Dalglish's novels and short-stories to date, and with every single one I find something new and exciting. While this is a re-publish of his earlier books, it's an updated, upgraded version. The story now has a lot more depth and consistency, and over all is just better quality than the previous ones. Which isn't to say the others were bad, they were great, just that this is an improvement ;) If you've read the other books before these, read these. They're somewhat pricey for a kindle novel, but it's worth every single penny. Just so you know, I'm not just a Dalglish fanboy, I only support author whom I believe have talent and skill, both of which and more Dalglish has .
As posted by reviewers before me, the book is kind of a run-of-the-mill fantasy novel. It's good, not great. It's fun to read at times, but at others it's a little painful. I would recommend it because it's free, if it weren't I wouldn't waste more than a few dollars on it. I don't know how the books after this in the series play out, but I plan on getting the next one to see how it plays out. The book has potential, now all that's left to do is see if the author acts on it. (If the author had a better editor the book could have been amazing, just sayin' .
I picked up the book from my school library, and I immediately noticed that the environment posed to the reader by Barron is amazing, and you immediately find yourself immersed in the book. I did not entirely enjoy the book, as it was not really fitting of some of my own preferences, but I can't bring down any stars solely for my personal preference. The book is smooth, (a little slow at a couple of times), innocent, and, in a sense, refreshing. The writing is simple and easy to follow. I can see younger readers finding it many times more enjoyable than I did, and I highly recommend it to anybody within the recommended age group .
I felt like the book started very well, albeit, lacking in some detail, and the writing seemed a little too simplistic and not well thought out. I enjoyed reading it, but I feel like it took a nosedive towards the end. I won't be buying the rest of the books in the series, maybe the next one, to see if the ending is made up for, but since it's free and you have absolutely nothing better to do whatsoever, go for it. See for yourself. Don't recommend it if you have another thing to read, it'd be a waste of time, but if you're still curious, go for it. I'd give it 2 1/2 stars .
The first book in a series that is far more worth than the money you spend, as well as the time it takes to read. I highly recommend it to any dark fantasy reader. If you're a little squeemish, and can't handle a gory fight scene or two I'd say walk away right now. If you don't mind a little blood and viscera, read it! It's worth the time, and I'm confident you'll buy every other book in the series and not regret it for one second .
If you've read the first, and enjoyed it, get the second, it has all of the good, and less of the bad (that was minor to begin with). If you were kind of wary after the first, but was on the fence about getting the second, get it. You won't be disappointed .
Another amazing series from Dalglish, and more than worth the money I spent on it. The story is easy to follow, and a good one to boot ;) I don't want to look like just some fanboy, but I am. Either way, it's a great series, It's perfectly fine to read as a stand-alone, but it's easier to understand if you have a little bit of Dalglish back-story. Either way, it's as good a place to start as any .
I finished 2BR02B in one sitting, and I enjoyed quite a bit of it. The concept was good, the story was O.K., and it ended just as quickly as it starts. I won't spoil any of the book for you, but I recommend it to anyone with nothing better to do .
I loved the book, and while it was a tad bit short (2 sittings...) I find that I got attached to the characters rather fast, and wanted to know more about them. I didn't like the ending however, seeing as it was kind of sudden. I could see it coming, but I went to the kindle store to get the second book in the series, but either they don't have it, or it isn't out yet. Either way, I can't wait for it! It's pretty cheap, but for being so short I would expect that. 2.99 is a good price though. Just hope the next book won't be any more than that. (Unless it's a couple-hundred pages longer :P .
I have had a hard time reading this book, as well as the one before it. I wouldn't consider my experience &#34;trudging through&#34; the book, but rather, chugging along. I've read the first book of the series, the short story, along with this one, and I believe this is where the experience ends for me. If you're a teen reader under the age of 16 or so I'd recommend this book. It's a decent starting read with almost nothing in the way of complexity. Easy to follow &#34;plot&#34; The If you're at least a semi-serious reader of fantasy novels then don't waste time on this book. It's not that it's not good, it's good, but there's much better books out there to spend your time on. The book just doesn't flow well in my opinion, it has ups, it has downs, and it has bumpy patches that could have been smoothed out. Some parts feel like they could be fleshed out more, and others like they last a little too long with not much to keep the reader interested. If you loved the first book, read this one, if you had reservations after finishing the first, find something else. I hate to give it 3 stars, but the way I rate books, 1 is terrible, 2 is bad, 3 is good, 4 is great, and 5 is for only those few authors whom I feel truly deserve a 5 star review .
I finished this book in a single sitting so I'ts not the biggest book around, but it was well worth the time and money I spent on it. I feel like the writing could have been a little stronger to make the &#34;intense&#34; moments a little more &#34;intense&#34;. That being said, there is some decent suspense. I feel like it could have been fleshed out to a couple hundred pages or so to make a full book. Maybe giving some back-story, and maybe flesh out the characters. But who knows, it's Dalglish, maybe after &#34;The Breaking World&#34; he'll make the backstory ;) Either way, another quality piece by Dalglish .
I decided to buy the paperwhite over the other kindles for the main fact that it's simple. Maybe not so much as went into designing it, but the use of it, the way it performs and everything. No frills, no gimmicks. It's simple! And I absolutely love it! I've already read 5 books on it in the 4 weeks that I've had it. Living in a small town means that there's not any bookstores. Nor is there any good ones within a miles drive. So convenience was a definite factor, and the Kindle Paperwhite provides that, (much like the other Kindle products I'm sure). Did I get what I payed for? Absolutely, and a lot more than I expected, and being an Amazon product I expected a lot .
A very complicated book,  that I don't really feel was intended just for the average reader,  although,  I can't allow my own lack of knowledge over the subject affect my review. This book I about exactly what it states,  a voyage in a balloon,  I came into it believing it was chronicling the voyage of the men who landed on the island in the book &#34;The Mysterious Island&#34;... It doesn't,  not even close,  still,  it was an interesting read,  and worth the time spent on it .
If you think you may want to read this book, do it! It's well worth the time it takes to read it. The story is original, the characters likable and an easy to follow read. The writing can get a little rough, but the imagery is usually pretty good, and you get a good idea of what everything looks like, and it leaves just the right amount to the imagination. I'm not going to ruin the story by nit-picking every scene, read if for yourself and form your own opinion .
After reading the first I immediately came and got the second, and I am the better for it. I can't wait for the second to come out. This book has its issues, as do all books. But It's well worth the money, and the time it takes to read it .
I don't want to seem like a fanboy of Dalglish, but I do have to say that I've absolutely loved every book he's put out that I've been able to purchase. The Paladins series was one such case ;) These are books that you would rather not put down. I found myself easily reading for 4 hours straight or more, and feeling like barely an hour had passed. I found it easy to lose myself in the story, which is well written, and filled with conflict :P  As another reviewer stated, you find yourself liking one character, and then disagreeing, then pitting them, then wanting to change their course of action. After it all, you see it pan out to an ending that you may or may not like, but hey, that's what I love about Dalglish, he's not afraid to do what must be done. The books can be gory at times, (which gives it a sense of reality) there isn't any chapter long sex scenes that you'll have to worry about either :P I would recommend these books to any person who enjoys fantasy novels, and doesn't mind a little grit every now and then .
If you plan on, or are reading the Godsland Series, I would highly recommend this to you. There's no point in not reading it, it's free, and definitely not a waste of time. I think it took me about 20 minutes to read it. If you're gonna read the series, read it, if not, there's no point :P .
Never read this author before.  Would read this author again.  Kept the story interesting as well as the interaction of the characters.  Very satisfied with the book.  B .
Found it hard to really get into.  A lot of characters to keeps track of.  Maybe just not my kind of book.  May be great read for other people.  Thank  you, B .
Not quitevas good as the first book but was well worth the read.  You can't help but love Nathan and Harv what what they do.  Adventureous and exciting.  Bea .
My dog love the mini snacks.  Could not find them at my local Walmarts of any other store since Christmas and was lucky too find them on line.  You have made my Su-Ling very happy.  Awesome product!!  Bea .
i have used it a couple of times.  It gives me something to do when riding with my husband.  A good past time when you don't feel like reading.  I also like the challenge of being timed.  Good fun.  Bea .
I  bought this phone for my mother, who needed a new phone  no voicemail call waiting.just a phone. Nice phone worth out of extra carp. This is a basic phone . She has NO interest in Celll iPhone or cordless. THANK YOU. Roman .
Haven't even worn these yet and I'm sewing the holes in them up. Even those won't stay long due to the thin, gauze like fabric. Not worth the money .
it works very good - good reception good soundthe only thing is the one i had before this - the head piece was adjustable and this one is not - so it is a little big for head and i always feel it is falling off. Other than that i like it alot.nancy norris .
After 2 weeks of just normal use the binding is coming off/ the magnet has fallen to the side and will not close. The stitching is coming out. Just a bad product!! DO NOT BUY .
Covers all important topicsContains good set of questionsDoesn't go out of scopeGOOD BOOK IF YOU ARE SHORT ON TIME AND WANT TO PREPARE FOR A TECH INTERVIEW .
I like it, except there is ventilation. I get all sweaty even when it's little cold outside. Can not wear it much in SF bay area .
Easy, simple and looks just like the picture. I like not having to carry much and this wallet does it all .
Great case very slim.  I got the turquoise mint very bright color not quite like the picture but il like it just the same.  It for have sparkles so I would not recommend this for men .
The case fits great and stands up to drops and falls. I like the PU feel, slides great in and out of your pocket or purse and doesn't catch all the lint the rubber cases get. Does not stretch out over time either. Great buy and great price .
The case fits well and looks just like the picture. The buttons on the side are still easy to use and all the cut outs make easy access to them. This case will do great protecting my phone and I like having the stylus!I did not get the screen cover in my order though .
Fits well, doesn't slip or stretch off. Has done a great job protecting my phone from drops and falls. Looks just like the picture. The buttons are a little slow in response but it doesn't bother me .
The highs, mids, and lows are perfectly balanced. There is no way you could make these any better in terms of sound. Sure, they don't look as good as the beats pro's, but they sound 1000x better. No competition .
I absolutely adore this laptop. Its design competes with, if not outright beats that of the Apple Macbook Air. My only wish is that the keyboard had more key travel .
Omg the cell case is just beautiful! Received in a timely matter no stones missing and high quality! I'm very pleased with my purchase .
No words can describe this! I was so pleased when I opened the cute pouch to reveal this beautiful pink crystal pendant. Breath taking and so blingy! Would so recommend this to anyone looking for a gift for adult or child .
I liked this book very much, it exsplains a lot about the life of a boy who is grown now. but reallycannot give up his dark interself he is deeply  unsure of who he is .
this book is very  true and  scary if you are not a christian. our world is in a big mess this writer  seams to know his bible well .i read all his books .
Really enjoyed these books. Would make for a great movie too, reminded me of the Twilight series. Can't wait to go back and read it again .
This item wasn't what I thought it wasy. It wasn't made well but I have it now so I will make sure I read the description next time .
From  20 feet  the  reception is  bad do not use  them.Wish I  had not purchased just  do not want to pay to send them back.Mark .
Not really a compelling story for me. Disappointed to learn that the author did not have first-hand knowledge of the culture or the era in which the story was written, and the descriptions become repetitious starting about halfway through the book .
Sorry to see the shoulder area ends very short of the average female figure.  it is hard to fit a blouse or top if you don't have suffucient width there, as this measurement is cricital to a good fitting garment .
This hair was perfect.. I haven't used it yet but I was able to match it with my hair and it looks perfect .
why are you still reading reviews? go get this game and never look back youll LOvE every minute of it .
Pratchett's brillance is once again shared with us in this book. It is the first in Tiffany Aching's series and we meet a young girl we can all look up to and cheer on. We also meet a race of fairy folk, who while we may hope never to met them, are also endearing .
I honestly could not put this one down. Well written and enthralling. A brilliant re-imagining of the roles played by characters formerly well known. My only issue with the story is that I have reached the end of this tale. I long to read more of this Robin's life. If I can find a continuation of this tale I will certainly buy it .
I'd been wanting to read this for a while now, glad I did.Now I keep wanting to shout, it's a warning, not a Damn blueprint .
This is a very useful app. I honestly have never been very good housekeeping track of my period, and honestly tend to lose track very easily. This very simple to use app has helped a lot.Unfortunately my son, played with my kindle and reset it to factory. I lost everything I had entered in the app. Hopefully it won't happen again. I hope having it connected to an email address will help prevent such a loss should it happen again .
I am absolutely thrilled to have received my cards. They are everything I could have hoped for. I can't wait to order the other expansions .
While it's not the game I remember, it's still a bit of fun. If you've enjoyed games like frontier ville you'll probably enjoy this. Could use an easier energy refresh .
The author offers a simple and achievable plan with links to relevant info. However, his solution to cooking and heating water is propane. I would have preferred to hear about other options which would not require purchasing fuel, such as a solar water heater .
When you read a thriller, you root for the good guy and hang onto their coat tails wherever the wild ride takes you.  With Liz Raci's book, you hang on for dear Life, and this time the bad guys are those nameless hateful people at B of A.  I laughed so much when I was reading it, It almost helped me to not hate the all powerful B Of A.  Almost, but not quite.  Who wouldn't crack up reading what is unarguably the most unromantic proposal in History.  I quote, "We had been living together for a few years when I finally said, "Are you gonna marry me or what?"  His respnse was, "If I have to..." Freakin funny! How our heroine gets out of this process with her positive attitide still intact is downright inspiring.  My own home was in foreclosure several times before we were finally successful, and each one of us could write our own story, but it wouldn't be as funny, encouraging and enlightening as this one.  In my heart of hearts, I hope Banks like B of A suffer for their greed, But after reading this book, I think I'll leave that up to God .
I just received and set up the lighting studio. Directions were lacking simple, step-by-step walkthroughs for set-up but fortunately a lot of the stand equipment is modular and easily figured out. I did have a broken 105w CFL due to handling issues which I do not attribute to ePhoto and Amazon was great to refund a discount to my account to procure a replacement on their behalf. As far as the lighting is concerned - I was skeptical of using CFL for my main lighting but I have since changed my mind. I was pleasantly surprised at the intensity and saturation of the light. There are 4 combinations of lighting using the inner diffuser, outer, both or none. My 4 star rating is based on a decent product of good quality but lacks simple, comprehensive installation instructions for all the equipment in the kit .
I am not at all happy with having to log in every single time I want to showcase my photography. zFolio has a much better application right now for that one simple issue .
Its not creamy at all.. Hard as a rock! But once you get some crumbled pieces and warm it up in your hand its good! Jut not creamy like i would like it to be .
So, I'm a mommy with a three year old.  This product is so much better than a purse, that it's almost hard to describe why until you wear it.  Due to the way it's hanging on your body (like a sash or seat belt), it's very "stuck" in place.  You can bend over, pick up your three year old, get them on your hip, and carry the groceries in the other.  All while your purse stays right where it is.  The shocking amount of time you waste messing with and re-positioning your purse becomes apparent, once you don't have to do it anymore.  Since you always have two hands free, the number of tasks you can preform while wearing your purse skyrockets.  Nothing falls out - ever.  Zippers and pockets and magnets and loops and snaps and everything .
It works well with my laptop and the sound quality is awesome. My only problem with it is that the headphones are not adjustable .
I find it hard to believe that "Lesson in Romance" is Harmony Evan's debut novel. It has exciting plot twists, passionate love scenes, funny moments, and tender heart-breaking relationship advances. I like how the author shows you what is happening from both Cara's and Alex's perspectives and ignites you with the fire from their chemistry together. To me, one of the features that distinguishes this book from other authors is the description of the setting and the atmosphere. I really feel the author truly comprehends the magical (and sometimes blatantly financial) world of music and music composition, as well as the pressing issue of illiteracy, which somehow continues to exist in our first-world country today. This is more than a thrilling romance novel - Harmony Evans gives us a peek into the bright world of music while also showing us a glimpse of how pressing dark issues like illiteracy and gangs persist today. But - man - Alex can 'play my instrument' anytime. Phew!!  I can't wait to read Harmony Evan's next book .
Item is plastic, not chrome.  The silver is a metallic chrome-like finish.  I am not returning the item because I do like it, but feel that the item description is misleading .
Great item, but should come with installation instructions....bottom part of backseat does not have holes for seatbelts and I couldn't use it in my Mitsubishi Eclipse but the item itself is awesome and definitely displays my Steeler pride .
I purchased this item after incresing my fitnesss level and needed some device for iphone 5. This did not disappoint .With its adjustable strap it can be used on any arm. Would recommend .
I bought two of these as gifts and niether one them worked.  They both locked my laptop up when i plugged them and music could not be loaded onto them .
The Kindles (3) i bought are just plain fantastic.  I love my Apple probucts but the whole Naziism of but Itunes stuff sucks.  Ipad has nothing on the my kindles....grab n drop is so nice.  Bye Itunes .
Works great with iPhone 5s!! Don't have to get tangled up In headset wires any longer!!!!! Awesome for workouts! Highly recommend .
Amazing story that I couldn't put down.  A must read!!!  Two damaged people finding each other and the skeletons in their closets.  The details of their sexual encounters is tantalizing.  I loved it and recommend to anyone that loved 50 shades of gray .
The story keeps you on the edge-I couldn't out the book down .. Amazing is all I have to say .
Loved this trilogy!  Once you start you can not stop. Amazing love story,  lots of up and downs but it's worth it in the end!  Love this type of story, even though there it's love of tragedy, love prevails .
I just loved this book.  I couldn't put it down.  It will make you laugh and make you cry. Enjoy .
Loved this book, the kind you can't put down.  That being said, the ending was weird .  Unresolved is how I describe it .
I just finished  3 and love them!  I can't wait for the next one!  I love that the story keeps you turning the page and wondering...what's next .
Great love story with suspense!  I love it, kept me wanting to read the next page and the next page! I couldn't put it down.  The steamy love scenes were the best! It's a must read .
I loved the story, but hate the cliff hangers!!  Wish I didn't  have to wait so long till the next one .
I choose a five star rating ***** because this book traps you so that when you have to go to the bathroom you rush because it's that good! I like that she compared the story to her life she had staying in an academy school. Dislikes- none! I'd reccomend this book to people who went through hell and sunshine who've had their hearts broken and need to cheer up. To people who don't know the identity of one of their parents. YOU SHOULD READ THIS .
Very nice elliptical... EASY to assemble and is sturdy. I have no complaints whatsoever. Very pleased with this machine .
One of the best books ever written, can't say how much I'm grateful for it. Changed my perspective about life about 180 degrees .
I regret I bought this laptop. So may things work wrong. Wifi disconnects so often than sometimes I have to connect it few times an hour. Touchpod doesn't work well as well, usualy have to press few times to open what I want. My old HP was much better.What is funny, just after opening Vaio for the first time, I got the notification that I already have 333 errors in the computer which make the computer work slow and if I wanna fix it, I have to buy special program. Are they normal? I spent more than a 1000$ for that piece of crap and they do that to a new laptop? No way. It's slow, so many times it's just suspended and websites don't respond. Few times Windows was completely not working, even restart didn't work. Maybe I just had a bad luck with Vaio, but I WON&#34;T recommend it to anybody, Invest your money somewhere else .
I have received the Squeeze & Teethe Lamb from Infantino to facilitate my review.&#8221;My 2 month old son loves this lamb.  It is easy for him to grab and he smiles every time he sees it.  The soft material is perfect for him to suck on.  I am excited to see how he plays with the toy once he gets older.  This is his go to toy at playtime .
There's nothing makes it feel like amagic it simply like any other..warm not so I can even see my hands through it..I give it a star cos of a fast shipping and the price..but about the quality..em em..don't recommended .
Simply doesn't work,rash my skin I used it about month and half and no significant results just waist of mony and time .
FITS BUT DOES NOT POWER UP WHEN THE BATTERY IS PUT INTO THE LAPTOP AND THE LAPTOP GETS  PLUGGED IN .
Ok, so a vlogger recommended this book and it sounded interesting. I read 75% of it in 2 days! Very interesting facts. I don't like this guys writing style. He acts as if he wants to build suspense , but it ended up being confusing and annoying at parts. Also, he leaves some relevant facts unmentioned and unaddressed. He pours an unexpected level of personal opinion into each story, tainting(in my opinion) an otherwise uninformed/unbiased reader's perception.I have my own opinions and have read much on many of his chosen subjects and have my own opinions. That said, some of the information changed my opinions but some only darkened my opinion of the author.I liked the book, though .
I purchased this because of reviews on this and similar products. I bought it used since I don't really care about the look of a book as long a s its reasonably useable. The seller I chose for ratings as well, and they gave themselves a large window for delivery,  but it came at their earliest projected date. That said, the book was in gently used condition. I've only just started to read it and so perhaps I may come back and provide a more in-depth look at its content and  information quality .
This product is as described. It may be my hair, or maybe the shape of my head , but it tends to slide back. Also my forhead gets itchy because of it. I can't seem to find a comfortable alternative. Recommendations welcome .
(5/10/13)Vendor purchased from:ArmyPropertyI've had this attached to my NcStar MOLLE/tactical vest(by VISM) for almost 3 weeks. I've no complaints about this product except for the securing system. The clips attach to the webbing perfectly, however, the straps that are supposed to secure it in place are constantly slipping which allows the carrier to sag below the comfort zone(wherever you prefer that it stays). I'm not military,  just a facilities maintenance person, but it seems that if I was carrying this all day and having to adjust it regularly in a combat zone or even in a security area,  I'd be a lot more annoyed than I am now being in an urban environment,  running from property to property, fixing, carrying, moving things. I plan on getting a heavy elastic strap and lacing it through the ends of the securing straps to see if that helps.06/20/13  The camo neoprene(or whatever it's made of) began pulling away from the top of the drink tube. My solution was to roll it away from the top to about half way, kind of like a woman's stocking, and then roll it back( I didn't let it form into a roll when pulling it back, but, made it slide down the length of the tube .
I am a Leatherman fan. I hate the old, original tools, but find that their new designs more than meet my needs in a multi tool. When my wife saw what I'd gotten her for Christmas(2012), she all but squealed! Made me happy that she was happy!I strongly suggest researching each tool before buying one. Chances are super high that they have one for your lifestyle, but don't buy one based on price or &#34;cool&#34;factor .
Sold and shipped by amazon.I love the way this thing fits! If feels amazing. It is truly fully adjustable with hook-and-loop shoulders and 3 adjusters on each side around the waist. I've worn it practically every day for a month with no accessories(to poor to afford everything I want in one order).I'm a maintenance/facilities management guy and I was tired of running back and forth for things and saw this as a way to fix that(excellent idea, by the way. I think all trades people should have something like this).within a week, stitching began loosening in the molle loops. All I've used it for is a caribiener with keys(35 keys, to be fair). One loop came out completely just before I received my first accessory pouch(Condor). Don't plan on taking this to the battle front. Weekend use for airsoft/paintball/hiking, maybe. I am looking and may spend around 100on something better in near future. (P.S. I thought the hydration bladder pocket was a plate carrier, shhhh, don't tell anyone, it's embarrassing!(Update:05/10/13) I've loaded the vest down with 15 lbs of gear, including my CamelBac and 3 tactical pouches. I've run, jumped and moved heavy items. I haven't yet improved/repaired/reinforced the molle webbing (and it needs it) but it seems to be holding up pretty well. 40 hours a week plus, wearing this, the wide flat shoulder straps are starting to cause slight blunt discomfort in the contact area(no chafing though).I'm still of a mindset that this could NEVER hold up under real combat conditions .
When I ordered these pouches, I thought they had elastic loops in them to hold the ammo in place. When they came, i was a little disappointed at first,  finding that they did not. My attitude quickly changed and I plan to order several more! I'm not in the military, nor am I in security.  I own a handyman service. These pouches are fine for holding batteries(which is why I purchased them in the first place). I found that they also easily attach to a belt for convenient carrying of small items you need every day! I regularly keep my Leatherman and a flash light in mine. I've also used in as a change dump when I'm paying cash at a drivethrough. I highly recommend these pouches .
It does what it's supposed to. This isn't a complicated item. It's simple. The snap closure is really tight and definitely needs a tight leather belt to be secured to. If you have a bit of "belt hang over" your body type might make it difficult to access. It's hard to pull a lighter out if any angular pressure is put on it. You must slide lighter strait out. Good product!The snap broke off .
i was really excited about this item. It came in the mail, i fueled it up, played with it quite a bit. Loved it. Today, a week after I bought it, it somehow came loose from its lid and fell somewhere . I'm very sad :( . It probably would be better with some kind of latching design so it doesn't get lost easily.  I don't have anything bad to really say about it. It's great .
Purchased from Best Service Stores. Arrived in time. This doesn't have high demand in the area of packaging, so I'd say it was adequately packed. Have it in use on my NcSTAR hydration vest(which is, itself, unimpressive) equipped with MOLLE webbing. It holds my carabiner of keys nicely.  Easy to access .
These are a great tool to have on your person at all times. You may not use it for months, but when you need it and it's right there, you'll be super glad you had it.These are higher quality than others I've had. They came in a timely fashion. The packing was a bit primitive,  but didn't affect my opinion of the product. If you're wanting to buy with the intention of selling, or having stocking stuffers/random prizes for campers, or whatnot,  you can buy 100 pc. lots and get much better deals per piece if you buy from another source online. But , if a few are enough, buy here .
I used this on bedbugs in a friends wheelchair(seriously! I'm not making this up) and all I can say is,&#34;holy crap! Don't use this indoors! Certainly not in a small room! I didn't get any on me and I was almost incapacitated! I was coughing and eyewatering, and my poor friend who couldn't walk and stuck in the room with the vapors! If you use this , be ready to deal with the consequences!  Good stuff .
I recently moved to a different state on a whim with little money and little clothes, and not being able to drive quite yet where I live now, I've had to resort to online shopping for what I need. Most my clothes are, shall we say, well loved, and I needed a lot of new things. These were absolutely perfect. I will say that yes, the tops unravel fairly easily, and one of the bows come undone, but other than that they fit great and are super comfy .
I purchased this Samsung Galaxy Proclaim because of all the good reviews.  Everyone said that it worked well on Straight Talk even though it has Net10.  I just called Straight Talk and was told they could not activate this phone without a sim card!!  I have purchased a Straight Talk $45.00 - 30 day service card at Walmart and a $150.00 phone that I can not use.  DO YOU HAVE ANY SUGGESTIONS .
Beautiful gown. but being 5'4&#34; the train was way too long so i had to get it trimmed. the top was a little big in the breast area but it wasn't noticeable. fit comfortably and fit nice around the hip area .
Without question, this is the best show on tv in my opinion. I can't wait until the mid-season break is over .
Good ... I like the fit and feel very comfortable.This needs some more warmth as when you wear that in Cold conditions does not protect you completely .
This protector does not give enough protection to the phone and there is no snug fit. The inside of the case does not have any cushion that could fit properly .
Takes me back in time to a simplier time..... Mixture of Rock and Blues.. If you have never heard this album,Please give it a listen .
I love this. it attaches to my belt.I don't have to worry my phone falling out of my pocket .
haven't had a chance to read it yet but i loved the first book and i wanted them all in hardback .
The last me more than a day on a full charge with very heavy usage. Never need to be tied to a charger. Will probably buy more later .
I was given a tube of Rhuli-gel some years ago for poison ivy and it worked great.  I then purchased a tube of Band-Aid anti-itch gel when the drug store told me I could not longer but Rhuli.  I can now no longer find the Band-aid anti-itch gel.  Where can I purchase this product and if I can't, what has taken its place, and it as good?  The Band-aid anti-itch gel is the greatest.Linda Stevens .
I love the top of this shoe.  Not sure if the wedge is too big for me.  Size 6 1/2 was not available so I bought a 6 which I can sometimes get away with in a sandal.  I have to wear them around the house to see the comfort level.  I really want to keep them .
I bought the pack of 2 because I saved money.  If I had purchased the hairspray in a store, it would have cost a lot more.  They were shipped fine, and I have had no problems using the spray .
I saw these shoes in a store and they did not have my size.  I was happy to find them on Amazon.  They fit well and are comfortable.  I really like the sparkle from the studs on the sides and front.  These shoes go well with many outfits .
I have not got to look at this book to much yet I have let a friend borrow it and she has told me that it is very good .
I truly enjoyed this book as much as her last one and I can't wait to read the next one! It took me a little while to get it read with the holidays but bring on the next one ! I can't wait .
It was very slow starting and it made me very angry I didn't like know that there are people out there like that but as I read on the better the book got and I didn't want to put it down. As I got to the end of it I was very satisfied with it and I'm looming forward to reading the second one .
I found it to be very good once I got to sit down and read and there wasn't something going on! It took a little time for things to get rolling but once it did look out .
Loved it and I want more!!!  Please hurry I need to know more! Can't wait for the next book .
This book was a dream! I loved this book. I couldn't have asked for a better book it was fast and it was one of them books that when you started it you didn't want to stop. So if you feel like reading a fast book this is the one .
I was very happy with The Surrender Series Books! I really enjoyed them and even had times where I couldn't put them down. They went fast but would recommend them to friends and really I already have .
It's netflix what can i say about it that you don't know already I can watch what i want when everyone is watching something on the tv! I can watch it on my own .
I guess the book was ok it just wasn't what I thought it was going to be! It took it a while to get going and then it was done .
Looks just as advertised. Some slight cosmetic damage, but in great shape.  Can not wait till we use it tonight .
We I got the socks they looked fine.  But when I opened them for inspection there were loose threads everywhere.  It was like I bought seconds, which I don't remember them being advertised as so .
Butt still hurts but not nearly as bad.  Cushion is fine just didn't solve problem. Still glad I bought it .
The bibs are nice in themselves, seem to work just fine although they are a bit thin, but they did not fit around my 18 mo baby's neck. Would be best for a younger/smaller baby .
Love this Amazing product!  Please never stop producing!  I get compliments on the fragrance and my skins appearance all the time .
i normally don't want to see a movie after i read the book, but i can't wait to see the film interpretation of the novel. absolutely entertaining and full of emotion .
Even if you have a good time since the first fat guy is not going on the first place running .
Great read! I could not put this down for a second. Can't wait to read the next book! Loved it .
Nice quick read, likable characters, with a different perspective, though not quite believable. Would be a great young adult read .
Oh yeah that's what you up to tonight today and tomorrow I night with with the day off tomorrow tomorrow night and I I I don't don't think so too many people are have to been be a little little while ago I .
Easy, fun read. For the most part, very well written. Not a classic novel, but extremely enjoyable with a satisfying ending. Still makes me want to find out what happens next. Is there another .
I thought this was going to be a sweet easy read, a nice little no brainer, then Bam! he throws in the kidnapping, the murder. Great plot twist, and a very satisfying ending .
Picture of the poster on Amazon shows it in color, mine came in black and white. I wasn't very happy, but I guess it'll do, just posting this as a warning .
Easy cleaning, light weight and charming... Love it. Good, Good, Excellent and excellent. I don't know what to write anymore .
Very very good cup, but you can't see the once because of the pictures. I recomend it anyway. Good for everything .
I've had this camera now for about a month and used it extensively in the garden and traveling.  The pictures are crisp and clear and the amount of functions are amazing for this price range.  It took a while to get used to the function dial, but I really like being able to toggle between auto and specfic functions like 'vivid'. The view finder is a little off but I'm so glad to have it as an option to the screen. It was really hard finding a camera in this price range with a real view finder.  Thankful to come across this camera. Totally enjoying it and the batteries last well when not in movie mode .
This book was interesting on so many levels.  It was a great looking glass into the history of a time that I did not know much about.  (History major, here).  It dispelled many myths I had about that particular century, (i.e. no one ever bathed), and it made me curious enough to explore the Hapsburg family to see how close fact was to fiction.Great read.  Simple and straight forward .
Amazing on so many levels!  From the beginning, when you can't figure what the heck is going on, until the moment you realize that this is a historical, yet fictional representation of our culture.  Hard time putting it down, and find myself thinking about it at work.  Reflected in Jim Crow laws, the story line is placed in the future, but somehow familiar for me as a southern woman .
I needed a bike mount for my phone for when I go to unfamiliar places. I saw this and it looked like what I was looking for. It wasn't too expensive either. It was shipped quickly and installation was easy. It easily held my GS4 in all types of cases. I used it for directions so that I don't need to hold my phone or have earphones in to see directions. The only problem is that the phone shook a lot no matter how tight I had the mount. This shaking caused the phone's position to shift constantly. I used it quite frequently. About 4-5 times per week for 1 hour each time. I was riding around, and I hear a slight crack as I'm riding on a slightly bumpy sidewalk. Then I hit a minor bump (barely 1 inch) and the phone-holding part completely separated from the mount. I did have a very protective case on my phone, but if I didn't, my phone would have been destroyed. Honestly I only recommend this product if you are only staying on paved streets .
The book is huge with lots of pictures and great stories.  My mom doesn't like to read but said she reads a few pages a night because she has always loved Oprah and the blurbs are fascinating .
Beside the bad remarks about this book, i was immediately frazzled when i  started to read it. This is an amazing book and i can't wait to read book two .
I totally love this book .... i can't wait to read another one!! :) I hope you continue in this route .
I should have trusted my instinct and bought a size B but I went with the C looking at the size chart spanx had online. Unfortunately they don't feel tight enough. Typically the higher power is firm and the material is durable but this one feels like I could rip them easily. I'm 5' 6&#34; (36-29-39) and I weigh about 140. Shipping was fast and amazon was great I just should have bought a smaller size. The best part of the spanx design is the open gusset although I never use it for what its intended for...it's a good feature though .
This ring is super pretty and has the "look" of being close to authentic although the stones around the center are small and need cleaning often. I would definitely recommend to everyone to buy CZ and not real diamonds. Real diamonds lose their value and you'll never get retail price or even close. Save your money! The issue I have with this ring is after 3 months, the center stone fell out. Just looked down one day and it was gone. Make sure to check the prongs regularly and don't expect much from a ring under $50 .
Pretty set but too simple, not enough shine or luster except for the middle stone. Nice but I'd recommend the heart shaped set by Berricle instead. Wonderful shipping but I think I'm going to return .
The shipping was great...no problems with that but not only did I receive the wrong color...light brown when I ordered bleach blonde but the quality of the hair wasn't good. Another review compared it to Sally's Beauty hair saying it was better and I completely disagree. Wasn't as long as stated and was thin at the bottom. It definitely won't hold up to heat and styling very long. It's going back .
This dress is not meant for the shy and modest girl. This dress is very sexy with it's open key hole neckline so if you don't like showing cleavage, do not buy this. The material is a simple cotton/poly/spandex so there is stretch to this. I'm 5' 6" and I weigh 140lbs (36-29-40). I read a lot of reviews talking about how this is cut small but I disagree. I ordered a large but really a medium would have suited me better. I'll keep it as sending back to China would be more of a hassle. I do have to say, I was VERY impressed to have received this dress one week after I ordered it! I wasn't expecting it til mid May.  I'm very pleased with this dress and feel super pretty in it. I'd definitely recommend a good push up bra and spanx to go underneath and really bring out the desired effect. This would make a great first date dress, just broke up with my boyfriend dress, or girls night out dress. It's light weight so if you're on the dance floor, you won't sweat too bad and if a drink is spilled on you, it will absorb quickly...win, win. If you're thinking about buying this, do it...you won't regret it as long as the sizing is on point .
Legs and iron holder are made from some kind of metal but board is from some kind of cheap plastic and broke after 3 or 4 times use. It was arrived in a great shipment condition. During this two months, I have used it for only a few times and then I found out that something wrong with the board. After I open the fabric cover, I saw that the board is broke. Never fall or hit with something because the leg is very strong. Don't waste your money .
I've had this flat iron for a few weeks now and I love it. I haven't had any problems with it. I usually set the dial half way to 450 and that seems to be just the right heat setting for my thick, wavy hair .
Adequate, but nothing to write home about. It's a mid-range product. This takes out small scratches and not tar or paint marks/scratches .
I normally wear a size 61/2. All the reviews said that they run big so I ordered a 6. They fit PERFECT. Unlike the old Dr. Martens, the leather is very soft and comfortable. The sole is not as prominent as the old Dr. Martens which makes them less bulky looking. I wore this boot all day when I received them. This is definately a must have if you want a good looking and VERY comfortable boot. Shipping from Amazon was super fast also .
This is a great story no matter your age.  It it beautifully written and illustrated by a mother and daugnter team, Gabriele Mamone and Dr. Debbie Mamone, a Pediatrician.  It is about all of these fur friends who have met from all around the world and yes, they really do exist.  They have all gotten together, well, buy the book.  You won't be disappointed and you will be able to meet all the characters and see their real pictures in the book!  And if you didn't but the first Once Upon A Rose Princess buy it also, you'll love it. &#9829 .
Haven't used yet, bought for xmas gift. Did open box, looks like great deal compared to other sets we checked in stores .
Very neat looking, works well. A good inexpensive tool to keep tabs on you weight. Guys over 370 lbs use it daily and have never given a problem .
I only had it a week, was not happy with it at all. It all fall apart so I would not buy again .
I just received the dictionary today after placing the order more than one month ago. I visited the post office to check the package by myself and I could finally got it. Around 100 pages were in shrink condition that I have to put them back into their right place. I wonder where those pages started to shrink; is it from the packaging point or at the checking or customs point?.While reading the words and their definitions I found that they are very clear and understandable. Everything almost as perfect as I've been expected to. However, there are things that caused me to conclude that it is only a four starred dictionary. The first is the paper which is too thin, which is easily torn apart. Secondly, there is no colorful picture to attract my eyes. Thirdly, I need more encyclopedic definitions about some worldly events like the 9/11 2001 in New York. In my opinion there should be a picture of the "late" twin towers along with the list of suspects, both individual and organization, and more detailed story about what exactly has happened in the 9/11 event. But most of all, it is a quite satisfying dictionary which must be collected by everyone who is serious in English .
My 5 stars rating is enough to express my impression of this product. However, it is better if the next edition includes some more up to date entries about the latest events happened to influence the world. I found that the dictionary is somewhat smaller than the Oxford American Dictionary,which I bought earlier, even though both have equal size in product descriptions. The content is so extraordinary, which means exceeded my expectation, the paper and cover are of high quality materials. The only question I keep asking is that the dictionary seemed specially composed for the exclusive use of American people only because the entries and pictures are too Americanized. But most of all I would not change my 5 stars rating for this product since it has brought me a newer nuance in words exploration .
Even though the dimension is smaller than my expectation and the paper is very thin but it's still very good. No doubt it gain fiver stars. The bounded leather is nice and the printing is clear. I planned to buy another one for a gift next time. One again it is an amazing book .
It is a good dictionary with an old fashion performance. There is no colorful picture to attract my eyes. Words in the addenda should be inserted into the existing entries. The typing is more like my grandfather's first dictionary printed in Netherlands in 1950s. However, there are some specific elements to let me justified that it is a four starred dictionary. The first is the abundance of word entries which is not found in any other dictionaries. Secondly, the amazing printed size book, which caused other people to think that I might be a great lexicographer while carrying the book. Thirdly, it has been the dictionary of my dream since I was in secondary school. What a subjective reviews!!! I recommend you to have one if you are serious in exploring English through words .
It is a very amazing study bible with complete comments. It gives me clear understanding of many verses which I previously di not understand. In short, I like it so much. The only reason why I did not rate it 5 stars is the paper which I consider too thin. But again, over all, it is a very good study bible .
Okay first of all the packaging is pretty sexy :D I mean its full of multicolored stickers and stuff 2nd of all it fits perfectly in my note 2 the price is insane for such a Great product it's like 3 bucks a pop and they're not cheap what so ever  I would totally recommend I got my dad, sister and mom for there iPhones and s3's this is now my favorite screen protector out there thanks i smooth :D .
I'm not sure what more I could add that other reviewers haven't mentioned. I purchased this book mainly because I wanted a reference book filled with tons of beautiful photos of Native American blankets. Sure enough, the book delivered! It is my understanding that, unlike the first Chasing Rainbows, this book's photos have all been taken with a fancy digital camera which makes all of the images really pop with vibrant colors. Beyond the photos, Friedman provides a brief guide to understanding the history of the companies that were behind the blankets, thus providing context for the wonderful photos. In the end, however, it is the marvelous photos that show off the exquisite blankets that will keep me coming back again and again to flip through the pages of this fantastic book .
I ordered this cup for a birthday gift when it came in the mail I have to reorder it because the Starw did not come with it but when the second one came it it had the straw .
I could not get enough of this book! I was hooked from the beginning! I would recommend this book to everyone .
Loved it! Amazing storyline and very well written. Great read. I think I'll have no choice but to reread many times .
Very sturdy and easy to use.  The 24&#34; length keeps one from having to twist or bend to get shoes on; &#34;handle&#34; on top makes it easy to remove from shoe.  My husband was heartbroken when we could not find one of these locally (so we bought two) to replace the one we had that was broken in a household move .
Wasp Freeze really works.  It seems like professional strength.  It kills wasps and hornets on contact.  Just spray it on the nest at night when the wasps and hornets are in the nest, they will come out of the nest already dying.  Keep on spraying and they will die within a couple of seconds.  You can spray from about 6 ft. to 10 ft. away from the nest.  It sprays in a fairly heavy stream, not in a mist.  I also killed a big spider with it.  I highly recommend this product.  It is worth the money .
I received a large Gildan tank top within a few days.  It is all cotton, feels good, a good fit, not too big or too small, and a good value.  I would definitely recommend this tank top .
The Saferest California King mattress and box spring encasements appear to be durable and good quality. I cannot comment on how long they will last because I just bought them.  The micro zippers appear to be good quality and have velco covers at the end which appear to be effective.  They fit the mattress and box springs well, and the mattress encasement has a nice soft terrycloth top. I am completely satisfied with these encasements at this point .
I bought three of these Fruit of the Loom dark blue large tank tops, and they arrived within a few days.  They are all cotton, feel good, good fit, not too big or too small, and a good value.  I would definitely recommend these tank tops .
These shades weren't really what I was looking for, the paint was blotched, there were several scratches and it feels like the arms were going to fall off. All in all, I'm not satisfied with this product .
Didn't work. Doesn't charge or connect iPhone. Tried the wall box and my laptop .
Its too big but I love it I don't use it no more... I'm a guy and its just too big in my pocket but its good quality I reccomend it to women n guys who don't mind .
This game is a waste of space on my device in my opinion and would advise nobody to get this wierd game unless trying to do some kind of prank. I deleted this game right when i got it and i bet that is what everyone did who got this pointless game. You should definitely not get this game .
It's a lot better than the other temple run and the graphics are the best. There are better upgrades and power ups in this one I recommend this for everyone. The only thing that I don't like is that there are demon monkeys .
This movie had the same title as the one I'm looking for but this wasn't it.  Back in the 1980's I saw a Hidden Agenda movie that had no Americans in it and the topic was more IRA related.  The main character was English.  I do not recall his name.  The items offered with this title did not match the subject matter I was looking for.The movie I purchased was good but not what I was looking for .
I needed the energy. When I'm sluggish and just don't want to do all that I need to do, SPARK givesme the boost to get it done. Thank so much .
I did not receive a loot card from my booster pack, but I enjoyed trying. Especially at the low low cost of the item itself .
I could not have asked for a better discount on this item. It arrived packaged well and in perfect condition with all contents untouched inside .
The product served its purpose and seems made sturdily. I have no complaint about the item itself. Thanks a ton .
Akira is a classic. If I can run at you screaming &#34;TETSUOOOOOO&#34; and you don't start screaming back &#34;KANEDAAAAA&#34; then I don't want to know you exist. The imagery and theming behind this movie influenced countless anime and scifi works to come. Chances are something will feel familiar and you'll realize that you've already seen references. If you haven't seen Akira already, get electricity and GET ON THAT. BREH .
This was a very tight fit. The shoe was beautiful but was made for people that have narrow feet. I don't have narrow feet .
I purchased this on feb. 12 th still do not have, still not shipped. Said ships in two days. I really need this for my business and yet paid and have nothing. Very Disapointed . Have order many things from here this is the only problem. Makes me frustrated .
No worth the time and money. The picture is deceiving the actual color is black and has many defects on different parts. It was a let down from Amazon .
Funny movie. Can't believe I hadn't seen it before now. Usually don't like older movies but it kept me laughing .
A good romance . Not all the  characters developed the way one would  have liked but Worth the read as said before .
I found that this book reminded me of why I believe in God. It also helped me to put known truths into perspective and strengthened my faith that God is sovereign and in control. Nothing takes Him by surprise and He is God alone .
I have always liked the messages and teachings of Charles Stanley and this book was not a disappointment. It helped me to focus and pointed me to God"s word. Truly a blessing .
The story was good was not the simple girl moves to new town and meets boy story.  There was intrigue the personalities of the characters were developed and the setting one could imagine.  One could actually see the movie.I really enjoyed it .
I liked the characters.  They were real and one could identify with them.  The only negative was that the end was not as detailed as the rest of the story when they separated. Good otherwise .
An interesting read. Story line was definitely different and was a clean story but still that kept it real.Not bad .
The product arrived quickly and the packaging was nice. I have only been using this for a couple of weeks but I have noticed improvement in the way my skin looks and feels. My skin looks brighter and fine lines have shown some improvement. I have a couple of dark spots I hope will fade as I continue to use it. I had been using a different Vitamin C serum I purchased a couple of months before I found this one. It was priced the same but the results were not even close.  I have to say OUI is far superior and their customer service is excellent. I will be buying this product from them again .
I live in the UK where these pants are not available so I ordered 5 pairs via a USA friend.They are excellent.Fabric not too thin or light weight and soft.Fit is first class.Style is excellent.Very worthy pants which I purchased in all colours.Only very small niggle is the inner pockets within front pocketsyou have to dig around to retrieve small items .
This is the cheapest place to get this product by far :) I decided to try this product to help with my dogs fatty tumors, at the advice of my friend. Gave him 1oz per day. After several weeks, the tumors started to shrink! There was a significant reduction in size. They went from a softball size to around golfball size. Then after a cpl months, the tumors started to grow back. :(  They returned to their original size. I may try the gel in addition to the neutralizer and see if that helps. It was very amazing how they shrunk, even if only for a while .
It worked well for a few days, then it wouldn't take a charge. I tried several charging cables and none of them worked .
I mean what is there to say about the best fishing reel ever i mean ever i have been useing these for years and i won't use any thing else. I have landed a 75 LB catfish with one so do i need to say any more. Just get one you won't be disappointed with it .
When i got this i installed the cd that came with it and it would not work well with some looking around at the installed device it wasn't even an easycap it was a smi grabber witch is the fake version of easycap so the audio doesnt work and the video sucks but i wasnt going to fight the guy i got it from because it was cheap and i didnt want to wait another 4 weeks to get it and hope it would get here some day .
just like the old one but with out the broken glass on it and it fit like a glove couldn't ask for better .
There isn't any thing i can say bad about this computer and not enough space to tell you all the good things about it .
just like the old one but with out the scratches on it and it fit like a glove couldn't ask for better .
I absolutely loved this book! They're story was way before my time, but it doesn't matter, because some stories are so great! there just timeless!I remember hearing references to Martin & lewis through out my life, but didn't know who they were. I found out later after got into Frank Sinatra. I would watch all there movies and watch any program I could find about them. But sadly they usually featured people who knew them and were around them during there comedy partnership...I wanted to hear it straight from the horses mouth!When I heard about this book, I couldn't wait to read it! It covered everything, how they met, there relationship, and why they "called it quits". I have to be honest, it was like I was getting a behind the scenes of there life at that time! and at times it was like I was there!I recommend this book to anyone who was aware or even slighly interested in these two amazing talents .
I ordered it for myself.It came quickly in the mail, but when I opened the envelope, what I received was very different. There are no details on the sticker I received. It was a whole different elephant, instead of facing frontward it was a side view of the elephant.It was just nothing like the picture shown.Very let down .
What is this a college textbook?  $80 for a softcover and the pictures are in black and white!  You can't even read a few of the pie charts because they are in black and white and you can't decipher 6 different shades of gray....The content is decent but there isn't anything in there that the million other Lean books don't have, it's just in the context of emergency services and priced 5 times as much.Basically the professor (Dr. Noon) saw an opportunity to partner with an ED physician (Dr. Crane) he had in his MBA class to take the same material that is in every other lean book, put a different context around it then price it like other professors price their text books .
i saved 58,000 pocket change to me but i was able to donate it to charity very satsfied i might buy another and donate some more to my collection its worth over 580million which is nothing im planning on getting some for my friends and i was thinking about keeping one in my aventador and bugatti for good luck got here very fast and no damage very good product i might even buy some for my workers .
It worked for about two weeks and has not since. Bad product .
I am a professional make-up artist, and I love young blood. It can be a bit tricky if you don't know how to use it, but once you understand how it works it is absolutely amazing .
Great paper hope it last and doesn't fade. I guess time will tell .
Love this stuff! I've tried other cuticle products but they either don't work well, too oily, etc. This one's the best .
these were the biggest pieces of junk ever!!! i was furious when they bent and broke off the first time i used them!! don't buy these punches .
Didn't enjoy this story as much as I thought I would. Vampires are not really my thing but I thought I would give it a go.and in parts I found it boring and didn't seem to get into it as much as the cover pic promised. My mistake because I known you shouldn't judge a book by its cover .
Found this book quite boring but I had to read all of it to make sure. Not really my genre but the cover pic was gorgeous .
A good Mills and Boon read which I enjoyed but probably wouldn't recommend as they all start to sound the same after a while .
Run of the mill, an okay read but boring like the author has run out of new material. Won't buy again .
I didn't find it as memorable as Ashley's other books but still had the Kristen Ashley magic to it. Was kinda disappointed in the story line as it seemed to go nowhere .
Unfortunately I found it a bit long winded and boring. I finished the book but now can't really remember what it was about so that has to tell you something .
Just about up there with Dream Man. Got a bit annoyed at times when things happened that I don't think should have happened but still an exciting read. Loved it .
A great insight into motorcycle gangs and how the brotherhood works. I was intrigued but felt there were a couple of things unfinished and not explained fully .
This was an interesting read but in parts I found it quite boring and wanted to get to the end as quick as possible. Story line was good but it didn't have any magic in it for me .
A readable story, not as enjoyable as others I have read but was good at the time, Didn't make me want to read the nest one too quickly but was ok .
Thought these books sounded intriguing but I was wrong. Still a good read but I have read better. They were well written but not to me taste, I think .
I chose this book because I wanted a quick read. I didn't particularly like it and will not be reading any follow up story .
very great product works great.it does the job pumps about 7 foot up love it. basement dream. if you do not got a ground drain .
I got this it was very very cheaply made no way its holding 3200 per self i weight 150 and stood on the botton and it bowed .
I just recived this very nice but made on the cheap side if you tighten the bolts to much metal bends also has some broken clips and scratches on it. in the prosses of working on a return for a new one.. but very nice to relax on if you are not a picky person this is the swing for you.. I am a QC guy at work so any damage sticks out well I give this swing 7 out of ten enjoyYork pa .
I love this case alot for my ipad. It does everything I want it to do. The slimness is great and the stand even better, while the price is best of all! I have no complaints with it and wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone .
A must see DVD. Part 1 was a 5 star series as well. Can't wait for season 8 to come out .
These did not work when I got them. I opened them up and they sounded nothing like the actually apple headphones. Buy it new not used .
dvd will not play. tried on 2 different players in 2 different homes.reading disc icon continually blinks but will not play .
every thing great. no problems. thank you.shipping was quick and secure.it proved to be accurate in its weight and works fine for calibration .
I would rate it just okay - it does have some good recipes in it but some of the ingredients are in &#34;british&#34; english and I don't know what they mean, i.e. crumpets (I now know that mean english muffins)  but other ingredients are just baffling to me .
I don't like this book - it is very disappointing.  It does have lots of information but I wanted some recipes  for Stage 3/4 kidney disease  not  a background/history .
I like the looks of this watch and was hoping it would help my husband in determining night from day since he now has dementia.  I am a little disappointed that the face does not light up for night so he can see the time .
I wanted a watch with military time on it so that my husband who has dementia could tell when it was still night or whether it was day.  This watch has very small numbers indicating military time so I returned it and I didn't think it would help him .
Haven't heard how it works since it was a gift and sent out of town.  However, she did say she was looking forward to using this and the blocks the next time she goes to yoga.  She liked the color .
I purchased this watch band to go with the analog watch for my husband.  It is nice looking but we haven't put it on the watch yet so don't know how it will look or last .
Haven't heard how they work since it was a gift.  However, she is into yoga and said she was looking forward to using them the next time she goes to work out .
Let me preface this by saying this is my first set of bib overalls, and possibly my last.If you like the look Uncle Jesse used to sport on The Dukes of Hazzard these are the pants for you.I bought these so I can work without mooning the neighborhood every time I bent over and not for fashion, but I practically look like a clown wearing these.First off the waist sits high, Urkel high! When sizing them keep this in consideration; measure around your gut, not where you normally wear your pants.Secondly the pant legs are so wide I could hide a case of PBR and still have room.Lastly the inseam is longer than advertised.I am keeping them, but next time I'll probably just go with some rainbow suspenders. They would probably look less ridiculous.For the record I ordered 30x30 .
Simple to replace the tilter and now it works like new. If your blinds no longer tilt just order this parts and save yourself the cost of new blinds .
Ok for the price but it has a tendency to fade in and out, the sound quality is ok, product looks cheap but it is what it isi use it but not on long trips kinda gets annoying since the sound goes in and out .
HAD IT FOR 6 MONTHS AND USED IT AROUND 12 TIMES FOR very light short jobs. Just used it to vacuum my car got very hot and stopped working, contacted the company and they said they would send a NEW ONE,will see if they do, and if it last longernot good suction at all, not worth the hassle to use does not get up the dirt, use a broom its better .
My order came on time and is a quality viewing. I hadn't been able to see all 3 series, so I feel lucky to have found them packaged together .
My order came with very little wait period. My daughter and I love it and can't wait to purchase the next season .
I only bought this one over the EatSmart Pro because I read some reviews and thought it'd be just as accurate. I got the scale and also bought a calibration weight. This thing never reads it right. Its a 500gram calibration weight and every time I put it on there I get 503, or 505, or 506. I turned it off and on, tare it every time and still get different readings. I tried my friends Eat Smart Pro and it read 500 grams every single time I tried the weight. I thought it was a fluke and tried some other weights of things I already knew and it was always off.I may contact Ozeri to see if its just this unit, but I really don't want something this inaccurate if its not. That or I will return it and buy the Eat Smart Pro and eat the shipping costs .
I am on day 2 of using this product and it really does take away my desire to eat & overeat.  I feel much more in control now.  I haven't had any side effects either.  It's too soon to tell if I will lose weight, but at the rate I am going with eatting less, I think it is safe to say that this product WORKS .
I had it before all you had to do is plug it in and it worked, with this product you had a do not internet work for to work and it still didn't work .
i was scepticle when purchasing it, but after applying it to my Galaxy Note 2 i am truly satified! can't lose for the price .
i bought it originaly for the price, but now i have it i very stisfied as good as any product i found in the retail store at half if not more off .
I love big nate books because they draw a smile on you're face and this one just made me crack up. Can't wait to read another one :- .
I like the ending it's a twist on the whole story line I can't wait to read the next book .
I love that you can build anything, I think it's the most addictive game, and you can build anything that you want to because I've done that. There are so many levels in campaigns that I will be playing for months.can't wait for an update .
I bought the app and its still counting down, I don't know why. It's after the season started and I was wondering if anyone could tell me in the comments on this app, thanks .
i like this phone..Not alot to complain about except the lack of directions given with the phone.basicaly they cover how to get started on the phone...but not things like how to move and store things like pics from text messages oe multimedia messages. I still can't get my blue tooth to connect with this model phone and there is no trouble shooting for this in the manual either.i have a plantronic bluetooth.  The apps were easy to dwnload although i dont have a need for all of them....This phone clearly was made for people that have a wrking knowledge of android phones and their apps .
I ordered this because I liked the design. Well in this picture you can see the shadow design really good but that's not the case with the one I received. I can barely see it at all on mine. Very disappointed by that. But does fit good on my phone and works to protect it .
I used this flashlight 5 times before the internal switch failed. I didn't even get past using the original batteries that came with the flashlight. My single battery Fenix tactical flashlight purchased ion 5/01/2009 is of better quality and has lasted to the present day. I sure hope that our Special Operations Group warriors are not using this light in combat operations, It is s piece of crap .
Haven't seen a tougher tool box in my life.Really heavy duty.You won't regret if you buy this product .
I just got this today. The massage is somewhat good, but not great. It is more like a low rumble than anything, but I didn't get it for that only. That was just a bonus. As a lumbar cushion on its own, it does a good job. I can already feel the effects of it after sitting at my office chair for a few hours. My spine feels aligned. I also like that it has a strap that you can tighten to tie down the cushion in place.My only concern is the durability of the battery compartment. The outer construction is fine and the foam is fine too.The color is also black, not a light grey as shown in the pictures.Also another poster mentioned something about the massage not functioning even with batteries in. The reason could have to do with the batteries not touching the positive terminals. I had the same issue, but after nudging the four batteries towards the positive terminal, it started working .
After almost a month of owning it, I'm thinking seriously to return it.I bought it mostly 'cause I needed an USB microSD reader for my son's R4, so I thought it would be nice to charge my smartphone as an added bonus to the reader. That part works quite good, I'm using it to charge my Bluetooth headphones to with no problems at all.The problem comes from the reader itself. When you put on the microSD card inside it, it stays on its "Slot" but when you place the reader into the USB port on the computer, the port seems to push the microSD card further inside the reader and then one of 2 things can happen: Either the PC doesn't know that the reader has a card inside it (You see the reader but not volume in File Explorer) or it DAMAGES THE microSD CARD!. Maybe the reader that I got is broken somehow but after inspecting it, I think it's a design flaw. It doesn't seem to have any way to stop the SD card from going further inside it AND it is a real pain to remove the card from the reader, I had to use a needle like for 2 minutes to take it out. It damaged my daughter's 16GB microSD card from her phone and an old 2GB microSD that I had lying around, which was not big deal (My daughter WAS!). It was literally burnt, I almost burn my fingers taking it out from the reader due to heat.I live in Venezuela and it certainly took a long time to come here, I bought it with some other things and I haven't read the return policies yet. I'll edit this when I found out more about this.So, in conclusion:1.- Fine charger, works as advertised2.- Very bad USB reader, but had to be used carefully.PD: I failed to mention that it worked fine on my sister's laptop but all the bad things happened on my PC. But the SD removal issue, happened regardless on where I used it .
These sheets match my room perfectly. They are nice I don't think there egyptian 1200 but they are at a good price and soft!! So its a win for me .
I had to read this book for a book club... Couldn't finish it. Had nothing to do with the premise.  I would not recommend this book to anyone and didn't even donate it to the free books .
Both of the pieces were not Crucial. However So far everything is working okay.Next time please state in your ad .
Every time her books come out I have to have them never miss one give her a chance and you will fine you will like her tooThe way she writes her stories draws me in and never let's me go till the end. Enjoy .
Didn't read this good enough! I thought I payed for an actual phone case. A little frustrated with myself .
I only started reading a year ago and fell in love with the bet....It's hard to find a sequal just as good if not better. I found myself crying, LOL, and couldn't wait to find out what was next. Its nice to have a different story then all the other books and keep your interested without a cliffhanger! ! You will not be disappointed .
Fellow law students (also medical, engineering....anyone who spends their days reading out of giant books), this is the book stand for you.I'm not much of a reviewer usually, but this has totally changed my life so I couldn't help myself.Pros:No more stiff neck...worth the purchase on this point alone.Makes typing while reading, which used to be a time suck of shifting books and looking around, as simple as could be.Now this is true of any book stand, so why this one?- 1st of all, sturdy as can be AND tiny. No trade off here. Can hold even my biggest textbook (I'm looking at you, Cherminsky).-The clamps are really sturdy, but easy enough to move out of the way for turning pages, so no additional time wasted there.-Like I said...it's small. Smaller than I expected, so I was a little nervous, but it does all it claims to do and takes up less space doing it.-The adjustable back is great. Never realized how useful it would be to be able to change the slant depending where I was using it. Even found the appropriate angle for reading in bed, which was an unexpected benefit.Cons:You may have noticed that I only awarded four stars even though I can't stop rambling about how great this product is. As much as I love it, there are just a couple more things I would look for in my ideal book stand:- First, portability. Yes, this is small, but something foldable would be better for taking along to the library with me. Most of the foldable stands out there can't hold paperbacks and aren't adjustable, but a stand just like this that you could fold up and toss in your bag would be great. Wishful thinking? Sure. But the heart wants what it wants.-Second, with a bigger book (still got my eye right on you, Cherminsky), it's hard enough to use this when you're too close to one end of the book that I just don't use it at all. Basically, with most of the pages on one side the clamp can't hold it in place. Yes I'm talking about 1,000 pages, but since the clamp slides to hold almost any size anyway, I don't think there's any reason it couldn't be a little larger.TL;DR: I love this book stand... if you need one, buy this one. Totally adjustable, small, sturdy and useful. Love you, Actto .
these pants are like the most perfect pants ever made they fit in every way and look so good!!! i can move around great in them and they don't hold in sweat Or heat 10 out of 10 .
Im a college student who really dislikes going to get nails done and paying for it, so I'm deciding to do my own now. This came in the mail today, a very good amount for just starting out. I honestly had no idea what 4oz was (to lazy to check) but Im very pleased with the shipping time and how the product arrived .
Awesome Game ! Cool fun &amp; funny you must think I like it because it makes ne think quick on my toes.  Something I need been a college girl. Its like being in school but playing a game, a fun game at that.  I tell all my friends about, I'll recommend this game to anybody lol . Everyone should go Download this awesome game, its not hard its fun &amp; a good help with your thinking skills .
i thought it will be a hard cover and nothing wrote on. But there was many pencil marks...Next time, please have everything in hard cover! thanks .
Five year old belt finally broke so I needed a new one obviously. It was only $11 and columbiana is know for having good quality products. Saw a review that said a size 38 waist only had two inches left once fastened but I'm at 270's 6'2" and there is about four to five inches of excess belt. Very sturdy, holds well, never loosens on me and looks good too. Highly recommend, I will be ordering more of there in the future .
A good book. Could not put it down. A good easy read book. Can't wait to read the next novel .
A very fun game. I can not stop playing it. It is all I can do. I can not stop playing. Must give a try .
Daughter loves the t shirt and it fits greatNow she feels part of the softball group. Quality withstands the washer. I hang dry to be sure it does not shrink though .
This charger definitely works for the HP Dv5-1235dx. I've been using it for about 7 months now and I have not once experienced a  problem with it. At first it seemed as if it wasn't going to work but after couple tries and changes of outlets it started working. now it works on all of them. over all really cheap charger and it does the same thing as the HP replacement. I spent more than $100 buying directly from HP and the charger burned out exactly after a year. so I kept searching til I found this on amazon, found a lot of other ones as well but I decided to give this one a try. I'm happy I did, No complaints, got it in 3 business days, works great.If they sell a back up battery for HP too I'd buy that too, good customer service over all .
It&#8217;s only been the second or third day I&#8217;ve used this battery and it shuts down unexpectedly when reaches 40% left and it doesn't give any notification that it will shut down it just powers off! My laptop refused to start up again, and it doesn't last more than an hour after full charge cycle. It is definitely going back. Very disappointed .
This book is a waste of money.  I am no genius, and everything in this book is common sense.  There are better books out there .
This book is graphic!  Yes, the Bible has stories about circumcisions and be-headings, but this book shows graphic and bloody images of Lego ppl circumcising himself, etc.  It is not inappropriate for Children .
This book is graphic.  It illustrates stories in the Bible that children cannot understand.  There are graphic images of Lego people being circumcised or circumcising himself!  It is inappropriate and unnecessary! Yes, the Bible tells these stories, but not graphically to a child .
The guilt in the past is in the past.  It doesn't define who we are now .
Using these gloves for almost a month now, in a frozen department at a Meijer store. A little of the plastic ripped off the top but that's not need, they are flexible took 3 or 4 days to break in. Great gloves! Keep my hands warm and easy to grab and open boxes .
Great case, feels great in the hand! Doesn't add much weight at all to the phone. Doesn't fall apart, much more smooth feeling than the normal silicone case covers. Volume and power buttons are still easy to get to .
Good Read!!! Alot of magic ,Boyle is charming with a patience for Iona which reads true love! Enjoyed so much,couldn't put down .
Watched this on my Kindle Fire HD, with prime membership.  Loved watching one of my favorite shows again.  Great romance with sci-fi! Can't wait to watch Season 2!  Love it .
This is not for an Ipod touch 5.  It's designed for an iphone.They would not take it back even though its not what I ordered .
I'm not always a Piper fan, but the man does make me think. I'd recommend this to anyone looking to go the &#34;next level&#34; of knowledge and commitment to Christ- it can spark good group discussion/bible study, as well .
Good DVD quality tho.  Gotta have the whole series so don't miss this one.  Still stars the original Angela!  It's a spookbash .
Not many special features like a bluray should.  The transfer is descent.  And if u luv Night of dem demons, then just buy it .
But then again, it came in time for Halloween.  I love H2 (1981) and this package delivers.  It has a gang of xtras and a filmed episode of Horror hound's hallowed grounds (Halloween 2) for those that reads horror hound mag which is awesome.  The tv cut is cool but its edited!  That's what I thought at first but then my friend said it wasn't edited just added footage and whatnot.  So i got my hopes up for the tv cut being extra sweet but it is wht it is, a tv cut.  Nevertheless, it still brings back memories of watching it on television.  A must own for horror hounds and Michael Myers enthusiasts .
It was a really good book and if this ever gets to the author what happened to Nudge , Iggy , Gazzy, Tottal, and Akilla? We do not get to know if they live or not. Other than that it was a really good book and a hate that the series is over .
Excellent for first ice conditions for when it's warm out and little wind. However I do not recommend using it in windy conditions .
This product is awesome. Ive been using it for only a week now and I already see results! I had been looking for an eye lash grower for a while now, and they all seem to either be unsafe or ridiculously expensive. This product however, I couldn't be more happier with! They have my business and will continue to have it .
I use this headset on a desktop land line phone with a headset jack.Pros:Comfortable, clear sound, no issues with microphone.Cons:No mute of volume adjust on the cord. The cord could be a tad longer.Overall I would recommend this, so long as your phone has built in vol and mute features .
It works how its supposed to. Shipped fast, works great. No issues. Plug and play. Good packaging and customer service .
I bought these for my wife because they have both our and our sons birth stones in them. Tad small, but for earrings that isn't always a bad thing. Very pretty. Recommend .
Love this phone, I only have 1 line but it has 2. No answering machine, but who needs that when everybody has voice mail. I bought it because it has a headphone jack, and I also bought the Panasonc KX-TCA60 and those work wonderfully with this phone. Great phone, recommend .
This is a great ring. It is in sterling, and I do wish that somebody made one in white gold instead, but that is not a reflection on this product. Great for parents or couples. Very good quality .
Great product. No problems. Worked plug and play with my Mac. I have prior trouble with other brands not working. This is the exception .
it fit my phone just finebut after 10 days the design started peeling off at the sidesalso its in two pieces and it really very difficult to have the locks snap into placewen u do get it on it sjust finemy phone hasn't fallen to see if it withstands impact tho .
Product installed easily and has worked well. Should  come with documentation describing classes of products to charge with which USB outlets, products not to be connected to avoid damage, how to replace the fuse if needed. The little slip of paper provided is laughable .
Great buy, would recomend to anyone whos not wanting to pay too much for a tablet, does everything suppose to do .
I don't know if this item meets my standards or not I have not recieved it.  Some how it was sent to the wrong address or something .
This book, using valid research, explains why the cycle of poverty is so difficult to break and gives many stories about the issues that people in poverty must deal with on a daily basis.  The middle class unwritten rules do not apply inpoverty.  Patterns of speach, thinking and discipline in poverty are different than in middle class.  Any educuator or law enforcer should read this book .
My second pair for work.  In between I have tried Danskos and Alegrias.  Did not like either.This shoe works much better for my feet .
This purse is super cute! I want another one in a different color. 2 things I don't like about it but its not that big of a deal. The straps are short when I put it on my shoulder the top of the purse rubs under my arm and its very floppy. It doesn't hold its shape when I put it down it just lays flat other then that I love it .
This book is a must even if it is not your first visit. Great layout and easy to use this is by far the best Disney guidebook I have seen, and believe me I have seen them all! I recommend this book to everyone I know planning their Disney World visit .
The terralux is remarkably brighter than the standard bulb.  Battery life is outstanding, and this bulb has taken a lot of harsh treatment. I have dropped it from 4 feet onto a concrete floor.  No sign of damage .
The only real downside to the dresser was the very heavy boxes, but because of the pieces being real wood, it was not unexpected.  Directions were clear and the dresser was assembled with no major issues .
These were a cheap knockoff that don't even work in my printer. I had high hopes but I guess I'm sticking with the pricey brand names .
I like everything about it.I've never had an OtterBox before but I'm glad I got one, it's worth the extra money .
I WENT THREW MY COINS IN NO TIME AT ALL .I THOUGHT WE WERE TO SPIN FOR COIN BUT I NEVER SEE THE SPINNER .
I bought these specifically for when i run.  Love them!  They don't fall off and i dont have to keep adjusting them every 2 seconds like with the i-phone ear buds .
I didn't even use this once, i smelled it and decided it wasn't for me.  I have since gone Paleo and rice is not on the approved foods list .
these are great when there is no time to make or stop for coffee!  One will keep you focused for hours .
If you can get past the taste, great for you!  It's the consistency of baby powder and goes flying everywhere if you're not careful.  After i purchased this I did some research on Soy products.  I am now soy free and i threw this crap down the toilet, literally.  Soy is not all its cracked up to be.  I would def not purchase this or any other soy product again .
I love this stuff.  I can't tell you how many different protein powders I have tried.  This is the best one by far, with the most protein and least amount of sugar and carbs I could find.  You can mix it with just about anything .
the taste of this protein powder is ok but i quit dairy and no longer use any soy, dairy or any artificial flavors or preservatives of any kind.  This is loaded with stuff you don't need.  Better off trying someting more natural .
nasty taste and not so good for you either.  filled with garbage.  A nutritionist recommended these to a friend of mine, I told her to hire a new nutritionist .
Let me say that I'm a huge Adidas fan.  Have been loyal to them for over 20 years.  Started running last year and have loved all of the Adidas running shoes I bought.  There are some runners at work who love New Balance so I hesitantly decided to try them.  I love them.  They were so comfortable right out of the box that i wore them for hours after I received them.  They fit perfectly.  I'm a size 8.5 in Adidas and same now for New Balance. I def found my new running shoes and will def be buying New Balance again.I just purchased my second pair! I love these shoes!  No more Adidas for me .
this bar is ok.  just received it.  screws were missing, found some comparable but don't trust it at all. my hubby is 6'5" and he bumps his head on it so i have to remove it after every use.  He suggested it would have been great to have brackets that are open at the top so you could slid the bar up and down to remove and install.  What a great idea.  Too bad i did see another bar i was going to buy that was just like that.  Again, bad decision on my part and I'm out 23 bucks .
the stitching is bad and the pleat in the back is not even centered.  Waste of money, i will probably donate .
I love these and they are perfect for summer.  I was a bit worried when i saw other reviews of how these pants run small.  That is not the case with me.  I am a size 8 through and through and these fit perfectly.  I love them so much i just ordered a pair in black.Update:  Just received the black pair and they are just as great as the tan pair.  They arrived even quicker than i expected.  Excellent company to purchase from.  They were so friendly and even emailed me personally to thank me for my order.  You don't find that kind of great customer service very often these days.  I HIGHLY recommend .
I bought this not knowing how the juniors large would fit but its perfect!  I'm usually a woman's medium and this fit like it was made for me.  It's long enough where my butt isn't showing when i bend over.  The material is nice and a bit stretchy.  I bought the yellow and its a great spring/summer color.  I just ordered the teal color as well.  I cant wait for it to arrive .
Professionally, I have been a consultant and writer for over three decades. Consulting has included providing assistance and support to those seeking to release fears, to realize understanding of inner experiences, and to expand conscious awareness. "The Sun Has No Shadow" by Etienne Pait is an asset of value for those seekers.When honoring the longing and yearning of heart to know one's real identity, old "mind stuff" emerges into view disrupting daily life. Etienne's shared life experiences and professional qualifications combine to provide a rare and significant supportive piece of material beneficial during a transformational process.It is rare today to find current written material by an author genuinely open to sharing sensitive and delicate experiences from his own life, experiences rarely shared except, perhaps, with a very trustworthy confidant. For those fearful of sensitive inner experiences little understood, there is now an author living in our time actually writing from his own life experience and has lived the ways and means to accomplish expanded conscious awareness.What a blessing Etienne's writing is, because he has carefully laid out case studies and examples along with comprehensive and practical steps the reader may successful apply to daily life to accomplish relief from fear - fear of the unknowns and reactive emotions often emerging during life transitions.When opening and beginning to read "The Sun Has No Shadow", a reader soon realizes they are not alone, for Etienne's sharing reveals him as a sincere fellow traveler in facing the challenges life presents. A page in the beginning of the book says it all regarding the quality of Etienne's character. It is titled 'In Gratitude'. Once one has read this paragraph, one knows they have found a loving friend.As a consultant assisting individuals facing life transitions, I thank you, Etienne Pait, for providing a written work earnest, sincere and comprehensive regarding a very delicate and sensitive subject. What a delight to now have available this supportive piece so precious to those longing in their hearts to know their real identity .

After the first book I was excited to read this one and it did not disappoint me it is great .
I am so excited about this book and I just finished reading this series and I just can't wait for the next one to come out. I am going to read this one again and hope for a early release for the next one .
I don't know what everyone else read but I just finished reading this book and loved it. I would love to read more about this family. This would be a good series about men that had been so abused .

R.E. BUTLER NEVER DISAPPOINTS .  All of her books are written so well she can bring you in and keep you reading .
I have read the whole series at this time and I have to say it is a good set of books to read... I am going to get a few more of her books the only thing I did not like was in some places there were words that was miss placed . But it was good .
What can I say? It is a story in a series that has kept me reading for the last six months so that should tell you that it is good because if it wasn't good why would I wait for the next one and buy it as soon as it comes out. If you are going to read it you should start at the beginning because it always goes to past stories and checks in on the people in other stories.  It was a great story. I love this series it has been great.  Can not wait for the next one to come out .
I just finished the full set of books I can't wait for the next two books to come out..... I just could not put them down .

Can't help but love these books . Only one down fall and it is that they aren't long enough. Always leaving you wanting more . Sexy men, strong women and just enough adventure to keep it very interesting .
I picked up this book not ever hearing of this writer and what a treat this one really surprised me. It is a book filled with everything a good book should, fighting,sex, a very sexy alpha male and a female that can be tough as nails . Going to the next book now. A DEFINITE GOOD BOOK .
I really don't think R.E. Butler knows how to write a bad book. You can't help but love the Hyena men so lovingly kind and protecting. Just to good to put down .
This book was extremely exciting and I just can't wait to read the next one. I just think it was a really great book and I just hope the next one is just as good .
You start this book and don't want to put it down. BECCA. JAMESON you are never disappointed with her books .
Wow. I usually don't like this type of book but when I started this book it surprised me I had to keep reading I had to find out what happened next. For a new writer she definitely has a way with her skills. This was a great book not to be past by. I only found one thing I didn't like and that was that it was way to short. ( I was gifted this book for a honest review .
The Brotherhood of Blood series is very good. A lot of sexy fighting wolf's. I just finished reading it and loved it . Keep up the great work BIANCA D'Arc can not wait for the next book .

Another great book and I think this one has been a really great start to the New Year. Lucien is one hot vampire. Ashley is a good teacher. Loved it . Jackie is never one to write a bad book .
I stumbled upon these books but I am not sorry for it they are amazing. This series is great . It has a great story line and it stays with the people from all the stories. Good action from the start to the finish .
This is the most exciting book I have read in a very long time. Blood Brothers is one of most exciting and entertaining lots of sex fighting and mystery. Never a dull moment.  I suggest that if you like this kind of book you will love it .
Beta's  haven  it's been a really great book and I just loved it. I have read all of this series and I have not found a book so far that I have not liked.  Strong hot alpha males are just a bonus. I love the way the author writes these books you get sucked all the way into the story .
Jackie Ivie has done it again. This Vampire As is just as good as the very first one. These sexy Vamps are brought to life with such a great story you just can't wait until you have read all of it to see what she has in-store for them .
R.E. Butler always has a bright light on her books because she is one of the best writers that I have read. Her books never disappoint this book goes along with one of her best series of WOLF MATE and is one is just as good as the rest of the series  the story line is great . It's a very good read .
WOW SHE HAS DONE IT AGAIN. THIS BOOK HAS A VERY ALPHA MALE AND A STRONG FEMALE. THESE TWO TAKE YEARS TO FIND EACH OTHER BUT THE JOURNEY WAS WORTH IT THE STORY IS ONE OF  BEST . CAN'T WAIT FOR THE NEXT ONE TO CONTINUE  THE STORY OF THIS PACK .
This is the third book in Rose Wynters series of WOLF TOWN GUARDIANS. I loved the book it did throw me off just a little I was not expecting some of the twist and turns that made the book different. I cannot wait for the next one to come out to see what happened next .
KYM HAS DONE IT AGAIN. THIS BOOK HAS EXCITED THE EXPECTATIONS I HAD I DID NOT THINK SHE COULD OUT WRITE THE LAST BOOK BUT WOW SHE DID. EXCITING IS ONE WORD TO USE TO DESCRIBE THIS BOOK AND SEXY. IT HAS A VERY DOMINANT VAMPIRE AND A STRONG WILL FEMALE. A DEFINITE GOOD BOOK. I CANNOT WAIT TO SEE WHAT SHE DOES NEXT .
I have been reading this series and have all of the books it is so very entertaining. It's not a cliffhanger and all of the stories have most of the people from the series in it. A lot of exciting things go on in this book. Some laughs too .
Jackie Ivie has a way of putting the adventure in her books. I have never read anything she has written that has been bad. She has done it again this story will not disappoint .
This book is definitely a super WOW. If you like a story that is very exciting here's your book I got this book in the morning and I couldn't put it down. I haven't read a book this good in a while. Now I will be watching and waiting for the next one to come out to see where it goes from here. It has a big bear and a reluctant female .
I was gifted this book for a honest review. This book is one of the best that I have read in a really long time or I should say since Lynn Reds last one. It is a great book it has a big cuddle bear a great heroine put it all together with a really good story line and WOW. It is a must read for shifter fans. Loved the story cannot wait until the next one comes out. It was so good that I also bought it to support the author .
Victoria Danann never disappoints I have read all of this series and I have always been happy with all of the stories she has written . This book has fun and excitement with a lot of snearing.  This is a great book worth the wait .
Carrie Ann can definitely keep you reading and I am so sad for this to be the last book. But it was a really good book and now that the story is told I cannot wait for the updates on the Redwood Pack. This is a great book to read. A great buy .
for an adjustable ring it doesn't adjust much, im sure its great if your really fat but i got it thinking id be able to make it fit my somewhat small fingers sz5 but i can only get it to stay on my middle or thumb other then the size issue though its nice cute and arrived really fast .
These little shoe socks are the BEST of the bunch, and I have tried them all.  The fabric is lightweight and fits easily under dress shoes.  They don't slip around at all.  I own 8 pairs of them in a variety of colors.  Just wish they were easier to find.  A major bonus-they are made of cotton, not nylon .
Worth buying. Not crystal clear, but has a humble and low-key gloss. Hope it will prove to be endurable as time goes by .
This item came as expected. There was not surprises. It is exactly as described. We are enjoying playing our Christmas music .
This was bought for my children. They have used and not had any trouble. The shipment came on time and there were not any problems with the order .
I received these as replacements on a wrecked truck. I didn't have any problems getting them to fit in the original location .
I bought these to make repairs on a wrecked truck. These have fit fine. I don't think there is a better value to be had .
I assumed this &#34; all weather &#34; cargo bag would be waterproof...not at all. If you buy one make sure you put all your stuff in plastic bags before you put them in the cargo bag .
It is beautifully detailed  however, the charm is smaller than I expected it to be.also, there is nowhere to ingrave anything .
Doubles phone life, I never leave home without. I can get by all day, without having to worry about my phone dying anymore .
I got this deal over black Friday weekend so we got this package for $150. What a great deal!It does come with a 16 gig memory card (it says 8gb in the description so we weren't sure).The camera is fantastic. We haven't used it a lot, but have been very pleased with its quality.Very happy with this purchase and with the seller .
The story was very good and the book was hard to put down.  I can't wait until the next book comes out .
I don't usually write reviews but I have to after this one.  I absolutely loved this trilogy.  This is by far on  of my favorites right up there with SC Stephens thoughtless trilogy.I don't knowingly to put in words how much I loved these books.  I have read hundreds of books and this was by far one of the best.  Thank you K. Bromberg for a great series.  I can't wait to see what you have next for us.  Absolutely lovedIt .
One of the best books I have ever read.  I couldn't put this book down.  There were such great moments through out the entire book.  Just loved it .
I loved this book.  The only problem is the end.  The next book doesn't come out until the summer.  I can't wait.  I want to read it now:)Absolutely loved Gavin in this book.  Didn't like Dillon, the hold he has on Emily is crazy.  I wanted to smack her sometimes for being so naive.You won't be sorry if you read this, you just might want to wait until the 2nd book comes out.  It is called Pulse .
I read all 5 books so far in this series.  I must say I wasn't sure about Conner in the other books, but I do love him now.  I can't wait for the next book .
At first I wasn't sure about this book.  I don't really like the past to present, but as I got into it I couldn't put it down.I loved Brad, not Ethan so much.  I just wish Val figured it out sooner.I felt like I was in this story with Val trying to figure herself out.I also loved Clay/Jet.  He was a good guy as well.Nick was quiet but had a good since of humor, Zane was a good guy as well.  But Brad was the best.  This was a really great story.  I loved how Val finally got her happy ending she deserve.  I hope Jade writes a sequel to this with Val and Brad an  there happiness.You won't regret reading this, you may want to punch Val for giving in 1 to many times or kick Ethan for not realizing g what he had with Val.  But in the end  all I  well .
One of my favorite book  I have read this year.  I will definitely read this again.  I laughed and cried.  Grandma is dam funny.  I am glad this ended with no clog hanger.  Great happy ending .
I'm not sure about this book.  I liked it yes, but there were parts of the book that I was like WHAT????  They go from no sex to a sex marathon and then they are having sex while eating breakfast.... I didn't get that part.  Also is the author not from the state's?  I don't mind where she's from but some of the vocabulary was off.  Yes, there is a cliff hanger.Would I recommend this book, yes but I wouldn't until the end of February when the second d one comes out .
Loved it, great ending to the series.  I can't wait to read about the rest of the band next.  Absolutely loved Drake and Chloe in this .
I just finished reading this book.  Definitely a must read..  I hope there is another book.  I don't want it to end.  I am in love with this book.Twitch, where to start...I'm not even sure.  You love him but hate him at the same time.  He is all male....Lexi is awesome.  I fell in live with her from the verybeginning.Loved Nickki,.Dave an  Happy.  Just read this book you won't be disappointed .
I just got done reading this book.  I'm crying and just wow.  There is so much I want to say but I won't.  All I will say is read this book.  The only part I didn't like was the prologue.  It was just wow.  Loved Parker in this, he was so great.  Anyone that has gone through cancer or seen someone with it knows how hard it is.  I want to thank Amanda for giving us such a great book .
This was a really good book, but very emotional.  You will need tissues.  I wanted to climb through the book at times and shake Tally and Linc.  But the book was so good.  I didn't want to put it down.  Buy it you won't be disappointed but make sure you have time and tissues .
I read a review that said they didn't like the book that much because there were paragraphs that repeated.  I didn't see that.  I liked this book a lot.  It was a fast read.  Very good .
You hardly even notice the product is on your screen. Care needs to be taken when installing, but watch video and take your time it should be no problem. Wipes clean easily .
This book is one of the best nude photography work compendium of all times. And its just volume 1. Can't wait to see the rest .
It serves its purpose. Isn't super strong neither weak. Can't resist an impact or a high drop but to protect and storage equipment ain't bad .
Don't expect this to be like the best of the best but its a good quality product. I recommend it (y .
Its ok I guess for the price. However, it is hard to iron, has so many wrinkles that if you don't play with the lights will show up in the pictures. Besides that, everything else is fine .
I took a little drink every monday after 2 days weekend.It refreshes me well and keeps me energetic.Love grape flavor. No sugar added .
I bought this doormat to ensure I wasn't tracking any dirt unto my newly shampooed carpet. It picks up everything. When I opened the door this morning, it had a bunch of blown leaves stuck in it. If it can catch leaves, it can definitely catch dirt, when I wipe my shoes. Nice buy .
This is an okay bag, but I was looking for more storage space. There are only a few departments to store items. Other organizers have more slots for storage. This would work for smaller purses. Its nice, but not as nice as the others that are on the market for purse organizers .
Great video to watch and great results from Joe. I don't think I could personally do this, but I do see the benefits of juicing and cleansing. I bought the juicing book just in case I could do a few juices here and there .
It was an educational movie; however, I am uncertain that it's 100% realistic, as many people aren't vegetarians. It's a difficult task for those who especially never liked vegetables to begin with .
Nice study package to encourage and inspire to never give up on goals from small ones such as weight loss, to bigger ones like running a business, etc. Great study! Great combination of reading, viewing videos, and completing weekly workbook lessons .
I tried this with the Colon Cleanser. I wasn't sure with the combination if the Garcinia was actually working, or if it was just more of the Colon Cleanser. From what I can tell, it worked ok .
So glad I bought the costume! The only down side about the costume is the sizing.  I'm 5'5", 138lbs...and i usually wear medium. Since they didn't have just a medium i went with the med/lg and it's def a little big in the chest area, so I wore a light blue tank top underneath it and it was perfect!  The zipper wasn't an issue for me at all.  All you need to do is fluff up the skirt when you get it.  The hood was in great condition, that just needs a little fluffing up too. You def need to get the leg warmers with the costume.  I wore this to a halloween party and everyone loved it .
Ian is a true inspiration and hero!  Words can't describe the power of his music.  His life was cut way too short, but I truly believe God had bigger and better plans for him that this earth could just not fulfill.  Instead, he is a guardian angel who now watches over other young men who stand to lose their life.  It can happen to anybody at any time.  EARLY DETECTION!!  Buy his CD and the book, Together We Will Win, by Karen A. McWhirt.  His story needs to be out there .
I could not stop reading. It's a page turner. I like that Michael Jr. didn't turn out to be just like his dad. I don't like that fact his father keeps getting away. He's just too evil. I think he's really the DEVIL. Can't wait to start book three. I recommend this book to anyone to read. I take that back, not no Christian. Lol .
THESE R GREAT. CAN&#34;T DO WITHOUT THEM. ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU&#34;RE TRYING TO PLACE A CALL ON YOUR CELL PHONE & U HAVEE LONG NAILS. NO MORE USING MY KNUCKLES. YIPPEE .
i'm not really a video poker player. its good for those who enjoy video slots. IT WILL KEEP U OCCUPY .
THIS IS A GOOD SCREEN PROTECTOR. HOWEVER, I DON'T LIKE ALL THE BUBBLES U GET TRYING TO PUT  IT ON. U MUST HAVE ALOT OF PATIENCES .
I just love this game. I brought the first edition of Cooking Dash and played it so much, I went to the Challenge mode. Love that one too. I play every chance I get. Can't get enough .
I have not finished reading this book, yet. It has so many chapters in one. Very exciting, keeps your attention. Can't wait to finish so I can purchase the next one .
Once the action starts, it doesn't let up. Zombie fans like me will definitely enjoy it. The story is plausible and the zombies are more realistic than some of the ones you find in other books. Lee, the main character, is realistic enough so you develop empathy and root for him. Put it this way, it's good enough for me to buy the remaining books, pun intended .
This book exploded from the gate and never let up.  It's thinking a persons action novel. He effortlessly intertwined technology and the possible effects on the humanity in a very plausible way. He's on my list of favorite authors .
The story line was good but the way the people acted was very awkward.  The conversations and confrontations were just bizarre since very few people actually act that way. It's almost as if the author hasn't been exposed to very many people .
This was a very disturbing book. I know BATF guys that were involved in the Waco debacle. They are decent guys. However, I do understand the main character wanting his pound of flesh. While freedom is free keeping it isn't. The main character and his pain, could be any gun owner in America, but he has the ability to extract a price for something that should rarely, if ever happen in a "free" country. On a side note, the spelling needs to be fixed but the spelling Nazis made some spelling errors when they criticized TJ. CMU (Cracked Me Up).  It saddens me deeply to know this is no longer fringe thinking in our country .
Works just like the one that came with my Vizio TV i had lost the original didn't know what to expect when i ordered the remote control but  i  recieved  it on time and it works great,  i am completely satisfied .
I think it is a good app but it does not have sound. I got this for my little one who cannot read yet .
Hopeless product. Don't buy it. Works fine for a while. But gets worst within days. Internet connection gets drop. Does not connect with devices .
i wasn't quite sure on how to use them, never used those before, but the teeth them selves were sucky, but i created a better solution with the putty stuff, i constructed fangs from that! it worked perfectly! if i had more of the bonding stuff to make my teeth that would be even better .
if you haven't seen it, buy it. brat pitt, morgan freeman and kevin spacey like youve never seen him before, ive wanted this movie for a while and showed it to my wife for the first time. blew her mind. I chose the bluray because it was actually cheaper than the dvdso if your a ps3 owner i would suggest the same. shipping was quick and it was in perfect condition, brand new and unopened .
Awesome game for its time. The game play may not be the best, The graphics are horrible by todays standards but its very fun and the reminiscent value is priceless .
i ordered this just for the swivels because i did not need the  rest of the hardware but it was worthwhile. they attach very easily and are strong enough to use with confidence. when buying generic accessories Uncle Mikes rarely lets me down .
this flashlight mount definitely is not bad for the price. its nice and universal so i can use it with all kinds and sizes of flashlight. decent for a man on a budget .
xmas present for the wife. bought her two cds and although they were new and inexpensive, the case of one was pretty beat up when i received it. she likes it, i prefer she plays it when im not around lol .
Its very different from what Apathy, Ryu And Scoop DeVille usually do but a classic nonetheless. Any fan of theirs won't be disappointed .
was a little slower to ship than the rest of my order but for the price it was worth the wait. its hard to find a decent cell case for a guy that isn't just black for the droid 4. stands out and people seem to like it. i kind of expected it to be a little more rubbery since its &#34;rubberized&#34; but id definitely buy from this company again .
I discoverd E45 when in England recently after trying many itch creams and oils and E45 has relieved my skin better than any.  I couldn't  buy it in Australia so was extremely pleased when I was able purchase it from Amazon .
A doll in the garden was a very good book. I couldn't stop reading it.Awesome book. Great book.5 stars .
Anyone buying this item should know it is not as long as the original cord but it is an excellent purchase and it arrived sooner than promised .
I have always consider myself politically of the mind of W.E.B. Du Bois but after reading this book I had a deep look into the soul of Du Bois and what makes him tic.  He was a DEEP intellectual who I feel felt like he could never truly be understood by his peer because I don't believe he felt anyone his equal .
I got this book 4 my 18 children (gotta keep the jean pool clean!) and their listening and being obidient and won't queston anything i say! There all just soaking up the Light of the Lord! how can i tell; you ask! Just yestarday billie sue asked where did stars come from and before i coudl give em a good canin' bobby sue popped up and told em! He don told him rite their, the anser! He said "thaht's where God puts the homos to get em out a america .
I have used them once and had great success.  Even in salt water.  Didn't feel like I had the plastic diaper pants on .
Super cute! True to size and colors are as bright as they appeared. Comfy fabric but may require ironing.... Not that I'd iron baby clothes .
Its a really great book the way it was written it makes u feel and imagine wats going on and its gets u excited i really rocommend this book trust me you won't regret it .
I did alot of research on this unit and others before I made the purchase and what I found out is alot of ppl install it them selves rather than getting it installed professionally. So those ppl had alot of problems with different things. Since I saved money on the unit I paid best buy to intall it.  So far I've had no problems with it. Everything works great .
This product works OK for the green screen effect, but the size listed is not true. It is most likely the UNFINISHED size. The size is a little smaller than advertized. I would recomend this product but just be aware that it is not 10X20 as advertized .
If you have any body that wears glasses these lens are worthless. I do, I unfortunately bought 10 of these. I'll have to throw all of them away. They do not fit well even if you don't wear glasses. You'd be better off with the cardboard 3D glasses. Absolute garbage 3D lens .
Great product, very happy with it. Only thing that sucked was the crappy minimal instructions that came with it. Awesome for not adding fingerprints and oils to your screen, huge improvement over the actual screen in this respect. Can tell it is on, but only because you know you applied it, it is seamless, and a wonderful product. Would recommend and will buy again for future smart phones.READ THIS IF YOU ARE INSTALLING IT:1. You get in fact, two screen protectors, one is a backup.HOW TO INSTALL:1. Find a clean work environment, clean the your phone, remove dust, etc.2. Take the screen protector out of it's carrier bag, and place it where you want it to go onto the phone (goes on one way with how it is cut out). It is indicated which side faces up.3. Take the piece of tape in your kit and tape it to the screen protector and to the side and back of your phone.4. The screen protector can now open up like a book. Open it up, and peel off the reverse of the screen protector exposing the sticky part. If any dust has gotten onto your screen, remove it. Place the screen protector back by closing the 'book like' flap closed.5. Remove the final protective cover with the last tab that sticks out, the tape that was attached to your phone will also come off. If you want to, maybe remove some bubbles now with the squeegee.6. Remove final bubbles, and make sure everything is pressed down firmly. You are done.NOTES: The 'dust removal tape' is sticky as all hell... I did not use it because it adhered way way way too strongly. I don't advise using it, maybe get some scotch tape if you really want .
I bought this controller because the modded one i had i bought from a company (rapidmodz) that cost double what this one cost stopped working, Its a great thing because this controller is the one i need to start with! This controller has so many great and easy to use features that even the old one didn't have,Plus like i said it don't cost near as much as a controller from so call "better businesses" this controller is what i'd recommend for anyone wanting a modded xbox controller. I was also very happy with the shipping it came be for amazon or usps was even predicting. It truly is a amazing deal with this controller. GeniusMods is an amazing company and i will defiantly be buying more products from them .
It's hard to see your screen in the sun...Doesn't work as well as I thought it would. Also took awhile to get shipped to my house .
I've never read erotic books before but this one was great. The beginning of the book never let what was to come, what came was a very good surprise. I would recommend this book to all my girlfriends .
It was Nylon, first of all, not fiberglass as advertised.  Secondly, I was using this to mend scratches to my titanium watch and when i used it, not only did it not fix the existing scratches, it just scratched the watch more.  It was not at all what I wanted and I should have looked at the other reviews before buying this..I needed one and it was cheap so I got it without really doing any background research....lesson learned.  Don't buy this .
I have not read the free preview.  I would rather wait and get the full book on Kindle when it becomes available .
I disconnected it because it does not do the job.  It's just sitting on the cabinet where I have the TV.  I thought Sony was a good product but my TV is a 42&#34; Sony and between both of them the sound is not very good .
I like it very much but it drives me crazy.  I don't understand all the nuances and therefore have won only a few games .
It Did the job. No problems. Just had to clean the fan out then every thing worked out just fine .
Detailed and approached from a different position. It highlighted details of other players of the time not often detailed in other histories of Elizabeth I .
I don't read a lot of young adult fiction so this wasn't a likely purchase for me. I did, however, enjoy the book and found that I connected with the characters and wanted to know how the story unfolded. If you're looking for a light-hearted read with a little romance and a good moral, you'll like Capella Bright .
This has got to be the worst game that I have ever played. When accessing some of the puzzles there is no way to back out of the puzzle if you are stuck and out of hints. This game will immediately put you to sleep. If you are given an alternative to die for play this game, take the bullet it will be a lot less ppainful .
I loved the 20th Century Fox one, this Disney one just isn't as good. They changed the dialog for Mei and Satsuki and some of it just doesn't really fit in well with the movie; also they changed the way Satsuki's name is pronounced. If you listen carefully they changed the way the cat bus meows. If I would have known that this wasn't going to be the same movie as the old VHS one I wouldn't have bought it. It's still good, but not as good as the 20th Century Fox version. Most of the dialog for the father and granny is the same and also most of the background sounds but you can tell they added some more music that to me just doesn't really fit with the original music. But now I know to make sure that when I buy movies I need to make sure they are what I really want. (i just noticed that on the cover on the Disney version they have mixed Satsuki and Mei together! Mei's hair and Satsuki's clothes .
Could of had more info on operation. Otherwise it's terrific. Watch is a nice size,not too big nor tooSmall. You can't appreciate the watch until you actually have it in your hands. Would recommendIt to friends and family .
Bad bad awful awful warless war story. Do not want to waste any more time concerning this so called book .
Well written/ did not want to put it downVery realisticLots of details and interesting facts tsThe end .
Bought these at Wal-Mart the other night. They seemed like they'd be pretty cool, but instantly had the black plastic piece on the smaller knife fall off on me. Easy fix but they could have put more effort in securing that piece down besides a single strip of (barely adhesive) glue on the back side. Then, the next day I had the screws strip out on the belt clip on the larger knife. Keep in mind I hadn't used these knives at all except to clip onto my trucks headvisor. You get why you pay for. Other than that, the blades on both knives are very sharp! And the belt cutter and the glass breaker are definitely a great add on (main reason I bought this set .
I can't praise this book enough. The only bad  this is having to read this book with the knowledge that it's the last in such a great series .
Honestly this is the adventure that you want to be on. Finally someone makes a book that you can actually relate to the main character. Stop reading this comment and buy all the books now. You will not regret it .
This game is quite innovative in that it combines multiple genres including a variation of the point and click detective adventure, grand theft auto, and the Phoenix Wright-like choice dialogue system. The main issue I had with this game is that despite the great job with facial features, tone, and what not, that give you clues as to what you need to say. Throughout the game you are supposed to use these human features to determine if they are telling the truth, lying, or if you should doubt them about a piece of testimony. It can really be random, kind of like in Phoenix Wright games where the dialogue does not make clear at times to what you need to do, especially since human aspects that indicate you should pick lie, or pick doubt, are quite similar. Luckily, if you are a perfectionist, there are plenty of guides. However, this is the type of game you really can't enjoy the first time unless you don't use one. Another thing, and this is for the xbox 360 version of the game, before you buy, you should know that the game is 3 discs due to hd dvd's terrible storage capacity .
I'm sure they'll love it! It's for Christmas and they haven't gotten it yet but I'm sure they'll love it .
This is for a gift, and I'm sure they'll love itIt's for Christmas and they haven't gotten it yet .
I haven't given this yet, it's a Christmas present, but I'm sure they will really like it, and watch it often .
I haven't given this out as a gift yet, but I'm sure they'll love it, I know they wil really like it .
Save your money. You can easily find these exercises on the internet. No need for the book. -certified international sports science association trainer .
After watching the video on how to apply it. It took me the 2nd try to get it on right. Luckily I had 3. I like it. It doesn't even look like one is on there. Fits the screen perfectly .
Five stars because I couldn't put it down!! Because it was well written, because I did get spooked, five stars for being a touch like King but different enough.  Well done .
What a beautiful book. Full of life and humour.  I found myself highlighting so many of the authors bites of wisdom. Totally surprised by the quality if the story and its gift of insight. I've never read a torode  book before and now I'll buy more.  Thank you .
The return of Danny is a pleasant surprise. It was so good to find Danny, all grown having lived both the good and bad. The development of the story is fast and engaging. Abra was a delightful addition to kings list of interesting characters. Of course I'm left with the desire for book three. The what has happened to Abra book. They is enough action, mystery, thrills and spooks to keep the constant reader Turing the page. Read it. You won't regret it .
Not for the overly sensitive. If you get offended then don't bother. If you enjoy a good laugh, do it!! So super funny. I totally enjoyed it. My only issue is that it's short. But hey it's a kid book...hahaha .
Not what I expected. I thought it was a story about one of my. favorite  characters but as it turns out it is about a book of poems and. Life lessons still a good read. But not like the dirty parts of the bible .
A simple book with tasty recipes. I'm not sure about it lasting 7 days because I've not tried it but I plan on it soon. What a great idea very simple. Although a mason jar is all that is suggested I still being a bowl to dump the contents. For the size I make the jar get cumbersome eat out of. Great salad recipes. Thanks .
I don't like the fact you need to use your own real money in this. it pisses me off. over all I think that its fun and my little sister likes it .
this game is so fun I enjoy it sooooooo much and it is so eddicting I can not stop playing it .
this game is not as fun as people think but its prety fun game.  $tacy.  this game is actually realy  fun .
it is so fun and very addictive you can not stop playing it and so far I don't want to fart on it like I do on the show American dad.wow that show realy sucks !? if u like it u should watch faimaly guy. but if u like American dad u need a theripist soon .
I can't explain how amazing this game is its fun and scary but a good type of scary. its just al freaking fun!!! please play .
This has been a godsend for me. I suffered from chronic UTI's. I would finish a round of antibiotics and within a week or two my symptoms would come back. It was horrible. I started taking this and within a week I could tell the difference, no pressure no irritation, no urgency. For those that suffer from chronic UTI's you know what I am talking about. I have gone 2 months free of any UTI symptoms even if I don't drink as much water as I should some days (that sometimes was a trigger for my UTI's couldn't even leave the house without a few bottles of water in my bag) I will always make sure I have a bottle of this on hand. If you suffer from UTI's this is definitely worth a shot. I am happy that I did .
Work Great, didn't take long to dry, very good product! Will recommed to friends.Awesome! Friends couldn't believe it was done by me .
I started reading this and figured it would be pretty much the same as all of the others I've read recently (all of which I ended up loving in one sense or another).  But as I kept reading, I loved this even more.  I had fear throughout that I would end up in tears, and that they wouldn't be sappy happy ones.  Just as I'd predicted, I read the last few pages, tears running down my cheeks.  This is definitely worth reading, especially for someone who not only enjoys a good love story, but also for anyone that believes that miracles can and do happen .
I would recommend this book to anyone obsessed with serial killers. I didn't like that some questions didn't have enough information .
This book didn't just rehash the &#34;Amityville Horror&#34; but focused on the true horror....the murders themselves and insight on this case. I cant understand why people still think the amityville horror was a true story. read this book and you will not be disappointed as it gives the REAL true story on this tragic event .
I do like this show, and have bought two of my favorites, however, some episodes I just couldn't understand. "Screams in the Desert" was one of them. Why would you meet someone who is making your life a living hell alone in the Desert??!! The one with the opera singer I felt was way over the top. Other than some others, this is a great show. It is worth watching .
Can't believe someone went through all this and came to be the person she is today. Excellent book couldn't put it down .
The batteries are the same as the company that put the fence in,but the price I paid thru Amazon for 4 batteries is what I'd have to pay for two.  So why pay $40.00 for two batteries when I can get four for the same price no brainer .
Product was as promised. I would definetly order again. These sheets fit like they should and I have never felt something so soft and comfortable. I looked forward to slipping in between the sheets at night .
Unfortunately it did not work due to extra notches on it. Can't get it to snap together. Would've really liked it if it had fit .
I got my case yesterday and it fits very well. I have 2 complaints though...I don't know what it's been kept in or what but there's an odor that's almost unbearable! The other thing is I'm not fond of the stylus pen. I think it should be easier to use like the one that came with my Samsung Galaxy Note II .
When my fuel was delivered, one lid was not tight. Half of the fluid had leaked out of its container. Otherwise, everything is great. Burns cleanly and efficiently .
This is a amazing game! It's so addictive I can't stop clicking and clicking! I love this app and I reccomend this to everybody .
I just recived this product a bit ago...actually recived it a day earlier then what i was told...which was quite nice!BUT...if you have a white iphone beware...because the pics show it with a black iphone in it so the case is not nearly as dark at the pics show it is. Its quite light. But its very cute and its a good rubber case. I would definetly order this case again but in a different color! Totally worth the price and protects the phone pretty decently :) very satisfiedThey just need to show this with a white iphone as well as black so people don't get the wrong idea .
Its a really good case...but doesn't last long.The corners start to tear after a few months of continuous use. But its not horrible by any means and it covers my nook well. Just minus the tearing in places its a decent products .
I really like this...its simple easy and its still compact enough with it being a wallet so that I can keep my cards and stuff in it if need be. One little thing...is that its not quite as snug around my iphone as i thought it would be. But it still holds it nicely! Its not a case for everyday use...in my life at least...i use it when making quick trips to the store...or going out to dinner or something with friends. Worth the price and i would buy it again .
Love It's a 10! Won't do my hair unless I have it! Delivery took a awhile! Overall a happy girl .
This game is a keeper.I have played it for awhile and never get tired of it. I have it on two devices .
This book had me from the beginning, I just couldn't put it down until I finished it, so that means I stayed up all night until finished .
I appreciate that this author gets right to the point without all of the fluff.  I learned some things I did not know.  I have made changes with my snacks and doing the exercise everyday at work, in the car, everywhere!  Thank you so much for this ebook .
The venue I rented only had rectangular tables, so I had to come up with something that worked and looked beautiful.  I used 2 of the 60X60 Square Table clothes for each table and underneath I had plain white full rectangular tablecloths I picked up cheap, so I placed the 2 tablecloths on each covered table and it was magnificent!! I got so many compliments on the decor.  I had 3 table cloths that had small stains after the reception and I put regular dish soap on the back side of the stain, used a delicate brush and rinsed out the stain, worked perfectly!!  I highly recommend these table cloths!!! They are absolutely gorgeous! Tried posting a picture, but amazon will only allow video and I do not have video .
I use these for dog training and they work best for me. They are loud, clear and  have no pea .
It was a gift. She loved the color and protection. That is all I know since it isn't mine. End .
I received this product complimentary in my #vowvoxbox from influenster for testing purposes.  I thought this product had a great scent; the consistency was not too thick, which I find to be very helpful, especially during the 90+ degree days of the summer.  I found that once applied, the moisturizer absorbed quickly into my skin, without leaving behind an oily residue.  I used it once in the a.m., after cleansing my face and before bed, using the same routine (cleanse, moisturize).  Also, a little bit goes a long way with this product, which I am pleased with because that means one jar will last at least half a month .
Shows are laugh out loud funny!  So good to see these ladies together in one place, and no one is a diva.  They genuinely like being together, and it comes through in the shows .
Not too hard, but not too easy. Just the right balance. I'll be sad when I get finished with the puzzles supplied .
Not too sure about this game yet.  It has a solo setting that is timed, but doesn't seem to give you much time to win. If the number called isn't on your card, you have to tap an arrow to get the next number.  There is a &#34;social&#34; setting, but I haven't had anyone else on to compete with. I'll give it a few more days, but may end up deleting it .
Mostly enjoyable hidden object game where you earn coins to purchase other items to furnish a room.  Don't like the rooms where you have to unscramble the clues to find what you are looking for, or the rooms where you are shown just a silhouette to find the object .
This is a factory power adapter and is excellent quality.  I have come to expect the factory parts to be better and this is no exception .
This thing works great.  Plenty of connectors for expansion.  It did not quite fit in the Dell case so I had to make a small modification to the case.  Not the power supplies fault.  Dell cases are idiotic and do not work with standard power supplies.  Overall this supply is a beast .
The case is a little big for just the tablet.  it is designed to hold the tablet and the keyboard.  It still works very well as the tablet only moves a little inside the case.  The pocket for the stylus is a great addition because the surface has no way of storing it otherwise.  Overall good product .
I bought this belt for my husband because he goes thru belts like crazy. I figured I was going to buy a good one that would last. This is it! I will never have to buy him another belt! He has had to adjust to it and get used to how it goes on. (He complained that it took longer to put it on than a normal belt.....big deal it takes an extra 30 seconds!) Anyway, Im so glad I bought it .
These lights did the job but were not &#34;Neon&#34; as described. I bought them for an outdoor 80's party and they looked more Christmasy than anything. Not very bright but again, did the job. Not the usual size as &#34;rope lights&#34; a little thinner. I did like how they connect so theres no break in lighting but I did have to call the company to figure out how to connect them because there are instructions for everything else about the lights EXCEPT how to connect them .
I love this shower curtain! It completes my bathroom makeover so well and if it wasn't for Amazon having it, I wouldnt have found such a nice scenery type shower curtain ever .
This castle is wicked cute but I didn't realize how big it was! And it has poles which I didnt realize either. I thought for some reason it would just &#34;POP&#34; up when taken out but the poles make sense when looking at it to keep the steeple up. My mistake but my kids love it and we found a place for &#34;Santa&#34; to put it on Christmas Eve. Its now back in the bag and will come out when we make room in a bedroom .
Cute shoe, they fit fine, I like the colors.....BUT after maybe 6 months 2 holes formed in the mesh by my little right toe. Not so happy about that .
This by far is the best vacuum I have EVER owned! Maybe just because I have had crap upright vacuums my whole adult life but I went with the canister because I have been let down by uprights that claim they do floors when they don't. My mom and friend both have Electrolux's that havent failed them so I decided to go with it. I could have spent $30 less on a Dyson upright that claims it does floors but I wasnt going to be fooled again! This vacuum is so quiet. Now I can vacuum when the kids are outside or in the bathtub because I can still hear them! It picks up the dog hair the first time and I havent had to sweep since I got it! Yes, it's amazing .
I should have known better than to go with anything else but! I originally had ordered the GoGroove BasePulse 2MX speakers mainly for the blue lights. Immediately they crackled and skipped. So I returned them and ordered these. They are AWESOME! For little speakers they have awesome sound and are &#34;wicked&#34; loud at less than half volume. And only $10 more than the others. These also didn't crackle or skip a beat. Very happy with this purchase .
I like the blue lights. Mainly why I bought these but ended up returning them because they crackled and skipped intermittently. Can't have that! I needed speakers for a party and these didn't fit the bill, but for anyone just wanting more sound from their computer, these would be fine .
Both of my kids birthdays are in Feb so I ordered this when I ordered my first daughters gifts for the beginning of the month. Her birthday went by and then my second daughters came. I wrapped this, she opened it, Dad was in charge of getting it out of the pkg and working and he couldn't get it to work. Nothing. So I tried to return or replace it and I cant because the window has gone by......thats nice. Now my daughter has a birthday gift that doesnt work. Im dissapointed because most everything I get from Amazon is right on. Hopefully no one else gets a bum microphone like we did .
I got this for an 80's party Im having. The colors aren't as bright as in the picture, but it will do the job .
My husband works on a boat and he needed a good case that would protect his phone from moisture and bait juice...ewe I know! Anyway, This case is so nice. It has the rubber part that goes completely around the phone then the plastic part that kind of seals the rubber and keeps it in place. So between the screen protector and the rubber/plastic case, no water......or bait juice is getting into that phone! Worth the .
I like the case but the screen protector wasn't the right one for the phone and the stylus doesnt work that great. Besides the fact that it kind of plugs into the headphone port of the phone and is in the way. I took it off and threw it in my junk drawer! The tuffy isnt so tuff granted these cases are very hard to get into anyway. One corner of the tuffy broke off into the slot of the case while trying to get it off. But other than that, I like these rubberized cases. Ive dropped my phone a handful of times and never had a broken screen or damaged my phone at all .
I got this crate for my puppy. I love the fact that once we get up in the morning I can let it down slide it under the bed and start my day with no problems. This is the perfect size for him and he loves it as well. I highly recommend this product .
This book was so great. I actually got into it after watching the movie journey to the center of the earth. Very interesting. A must read if I may say so myself. And I'm really not that into books .
Really love this Bluetooth it's loud snout for me not to have it on my ears. Really love it. Great product .
I was looking for an otterbox case at local stores and they were expensive. Look on amazon and got this one for more than half of the price. It arrived very quickly and I love it. It wasn't the exact color that I wanted but it is still a great case. Very durable and reliable cause I'm know for dropping my phone a lot.  Great customer service and shipping time .
This product came after the estimated delivery date. The charger takes hours on end to charge my tablet. I mean I feel like I wasted money on this cause I had to turn around and purchase a new charger. Me personally would not be customer again .
Although it doesn't have that snug fit I was hoping for its still a great product to me. It arrive 2 weeks early and I'm loving it .
I have tried other Royal Family mochi, and generally have had positive experiences. I really enjoy the Azuki Bean one... This was definitely not the case with the 'green tea' mochi.First they don't taste anything like green tea, I feel like even making the claim is dishonest. The only thing they have in common is that they are slightly colored green, thats it.Secondly and the worst offense of all is that these mochi taste like someone poured a bottle of pungent perfume/soap into the filling. I can't even get the taste off my tongue, I dare say it's not even edible.Into the trash they go .
Ok so I&#699;m not sure what others are expecting out of a $25 fog machine...BUT, for what it IS. It&#699;s a good product.  First off...NO, it&#699;s not going to fill half a gym with fog.  And NO, it&#699;s not going to have a timer. C&#699;mon..it&#699;s UNDER 30 BUCKS!!!  It&#699;s a good machine for what it is.  If you take good care of it, it should last.  To give you an idea of how much fog it puts out.  I put a good amont of fog in my 2-car garage on just ONE blast.  After 2 or 3, the whole garage was filled.  Here&#699;s my take:PRO&#699;s:  Small, lightweight, inexpensive, decent quality built of good materials. 3-5 minute warm-up time, and same amount of time between fog blasts.  Fog blast lasts about a minute or so.CON&#699;s: Small tank.For those of you who broke it after the 1st or 2nd use.  A couple of fog machine basics:#1 CLEAN IT AFTER EVERY USE!  Dump out whatever leftover fog juice you have, put some distilled water in there, and shoot it for a few minutes.  Then dump the water and store the machine.#2 DON&#699;T RUN THE THING DRY!I&#699;m thinking about buying another one and running one on each side of my DJ rig.UPDATE:I changed my rating to FIVE ***** Stars.  Why?  Because I&#699;ve used it a few times, and it is MORE than decent for what it is. It&#699;s REALLY GOOD for what it is!  I spent less than $30 bucks on this little machine and while it&#699;s not pumping out sheets, or cloud billows of fog...it puts out more than what I expected from this machine!  I did a small (50-80 pax) DJ gig in a basketball gym, and NO...this machine DID NOT fill the place or even a quarter of the place. But what it DID do, was put enough fog in front of my lights to make it a little more dynamic up front. And that&#699;s all I expected it to do.  Did it meet my expectation?  YEP. And it exceeded it because I only filled it about 1/2 way, and that thing ran the entire gig (3-4 hours). The warm up time is around 5-7 minutes, and then it takes about the same amount of time, maybe just a little less: 3-5 minutes in between blasts, but it&#699;s good.  I think the key here is CLEANING THE MACHINE AFTER EVERY USE.  That&#699;s where people run into problems.  You cannot leave fog juice in this thing for an extended period of time. So I just run distilled water thru it after every single use.And I decided NOT to buy a second machine. Instead, when I upgrade my lightng and buy a truss system, I&#699;ll spend the money and get a bigger machine.  Until then, this little puppy does a fine job .
What can I say about it... it&#699;s a basic belt.  It fits, it works, and I like it. Nothing fancy, just a belt to hold up my fatigues or tactical pants.... and I can hang my sidearm holster, and a couple of mags on it as well.  I wanted something low profile, because if I wear a battle belt over it, I didn&#699;t want a big buckle on my pants as well as a cobra buckle on the battle belt.  This is great for what it is.  I gave it 4 stars only because I don&#699;t actually LOVE IT... but I like it alot and it serves its intended purpose well. Buy it .
You know... you can actually just use a small punch to push out the pins on your Glock, but it wasn&#699;t very expensive, so I bought it.  I like it, because I know which tool to use when I&#699;m cleaning my glock lower and don&#699;t have to figure out which one of my punches to use.  I&#699;d recommend it if you own a Glock and want all the Glock accessories... get it.  It&#699;s not very expensive .
There are tons of positive reviews (and negative ones too!) on this blade and this is going to be yet another.  For a really good review on this blade, check out Nutnfancy's review on YouTube.  Just search using Kershaw OSO Sweet. Nutn's will be one of the first ones that comes up.  He's got all the main info on this knife in the description, and gives it a 9/10 rating.  Anyway, take it for what it's worth.Here's my take:The knife was $16 bucks (actually only $11 DOLLARS, + $4.99 shipping via USPS) SHIPPED... TO HAWAII.  It doesn't get much better than that!  I like the blade shape, and it's a good length for EDC. Almost exactly the same length as my Spyderco Tenacious, but a shorter handle.  And LIGHT. I like that A LOT.  I carry a Streamlight ProTac flashlight with my blade in my right front pants pocket, so this Oso Sweet is gonna be great because it won't weigh my pocket down very much.The blade:Steel is 8Cr13MoV.  Decent enough quality for me. (ESPECIALLY in a $16 dollar knife!)Blade length is perfect, again for EDC.SHARP as hell, right out of the box.Hard to deploy right out of the box.  I'm going to oil it a little bit, and try to work it in...but it's a little stiff to open.NO blade play at all, up/down/left/right. Very good there.I wish the liner lock stuck out just a little bit more so it would be easier to unlock. Not a big deal, but that would be nice.Blade is fairly close to centered when closed.  It's not perfectly centered, but almost.  No big deal...(remember...$16 bucks!!!)Handle:Plastic, lightweight...not sure how durable at this point, but again...$16 bucks?!!!I like the "spiderweb" texture, it's interesting to me.Wish it had some jimping along the top, but it's not a dealbreaker.Clip:As others have mentioned...it is REALLY strong.  Almost TOO much.  I think the clip is a little short as well.  I like the look of it though, with Kershaw along the side.  Nice looking but a little too much tension.  I can see it ripping up some types of pants fabrics if I'm not careful.Overall:Great EDC blade for this price. It may not be a Benchmark, but for what it IS...it's probably the best quality in a $16 dollar knife I've ever had. I wasn't actually looking for a new blade, but had this one saved in my wishlist.  So when I saw this knife on sale on Amazon...I HAD to get it at this price. And I'm SO GLAD I did!  I would recommend this knife, even if it was $25 bucks.  That's still a good price on this blade. If it's still on sale for $11 plus $4.99 shipping...BUY IT.  Right now I wish I bought TWO.And please...those of you who are comparing this knife to other more expensive, higher quality steel, G-10 Scales, made in the USA, blah-blah-blah, etc etc etc, knives... There is NO COMPARISON. If you want THAT knife...go buy that one. But...pull out any and EVERY other $10-$15 dollar knife, and compare that one to this $16 dollar Kershaw OSO Sweet, and let's see how THAT comparison looks.  This blade will beat out almost EVERYTHING in it's price range.Nuff Said .
When I was deciding to buy this I really couldn&#699;t tell from the pic what it looked like...because HELLO??!!!  The pic is showing the INSIDE (belt loop side) of the pouch!!!  Why they did that I have no idea!!  BUT... once I got it...it was EXACTLY what I wanted.  It&#699;s a dual mag plastic pouch, and it holds my mags (Glock 17) in place very well. It has a nice fit where the mags slide in firmly. I loaded 2 full double stack mags and turned it upside down and shook it...and yes, after a couple of shakes the mags did fall out...however, how many of you are planning to do a handstand and jiggle your magazines out??! It works folks.  And the price is decent and it&#699;s fairly &#34;low profile&#34;  and isn&#699;t a big bulky holder.  I believe the screw that you see between the two magazines is a tension screw and will put more tension on the mags.  I haven&#699;t tried it yet, but I don&#699;t see the need at the moment.  I&#699;m happy with how it holds my magazines.OH...AND you can set both magazines facing the same direction for easy/quick reloads.  I know there is another mag pouch out there where you can only put them in facing the opposite direction.  I don&#699;t like that.  I&#699;d rather them be set up so I can pull and load in one quick motion...without having to worry about turning one.For the price I paid, and what I got...it&#699;s 5 *&#699;s for me .
Right off the bat...This one gets 5 FIVE STARS.  I'd give it 10 of 10 if I could.Ok now on on to my review of this knife:While this is the first "name brand" folding knife I've ever bought, I've carried an EDC folding blade on me for years. I own a Cold Steel SRK fixed blade, and I love that knife. It's my hunting/camping/survival knife. And I own a Schrade SCHF10, which I also love.  But when it comes to folders...I've always bought the no-name, use it/break it, or lose it, then throw it away knives.  Usually whatever looks good at my local hardware store, or gun shop.  With that being said, I currently own maybe 8-10 different no-name folders (all under $20 bucks) that I have rotated in and out of my EDC gear and I have maybe 2 that I like, and that actually work in my system. The one I've been carrying the most over the last 2 years has been a Tac-Force Karambit style blade ($15 bucks).  I've dropped that thing in the mud, used it in a river, dropped it from a ladder about 20' off the ground, abused it in the rain, and it's been good, but it's seen it's better days, and it's not much in terms of a slicer.So in my search for a replacement, I started to think about getting something with a little better quality. If I add up all those $10-15-18-20 dollar knives...I could have 3 or 4 really GOOD blades! I probably won't buy a Benchmark or any other knife over a hundred bucks...I just don't have the need or budget for one like that.  BUT... this Spyderco fit my budget (UNDER $50 bucks), useage, and my EDC needs perfectly so I bought it...  And I'm glad I did! On this purchase, I researched all kinds of knives and steel types before making my choice.  And for the money...the Spyderco Tenacious is hard to beat.  Yes, there are tons of good quality knives at this same price range, but then I believe it just comes down to personal preference. I narrowed my search down to Spyderco and the SOG Flash 2 (they're both about the same price), but chose the Tenacious because I've always been drawn to that cool blade shape with the hole in it!  (I WILL buy that SOG soon!)I live in Hawaii so we are exposed to salt air and water on a regular basis.  I don't plan on diving with my knife, but I needed a blade with steel and internals that was going to have some corrosion resistance. I wanted something I could use as a back up on a hunt, camping, or to cut boxes at work.  I also needed this to be a regular EDC blade, and I wanted to stay away from the tactical look, and get more of a gentleman's carry that's still agressive enough looking.  What I wanted was something high speed, lightweight, strong, durable, and of course...some good looks never hurt nobody! I found it in the Spyderco Tenacious!-The G10 scales are grippy enough..but not overly so.  Just right, in my opinion.-I like the blade.  It is a little thin towards the tip, but it's nothing I'll worry about. I personally prefer the plain edge vs. the combo edge.  I also prefer the FFG (full flat grind) blade.  It's just my own preference. I think the 8Cr13MoV steel is a high enough quality...again, at least for my personal requirements.-NO blade play when the knife is open.  None at ALL. Up/down, side to side...nothing.  I've seen reviews of people saying there was some in their knives, but none in mine. When closed, the blade sits dead centered. I've also seen reviews with people saying their blades were off-centered, mine was not one of those.-Ergo: Feels good in my hand. Nice jimping at the top.  Nice big hole to slide my thumb in to open.  Opens quickly enough.  Not as fast as my Tac Force assisted opening Karambit, or my buddy's SOG Aegis 2 assisted opener...but good nonetheless, with a solid "Thwackk" upon lock-up.  I LIKE that!-Clip is a bit tight, but not a deal breaker.  I like that I can change it to a tip up carry as opposed to tip down, as it comes from the factory.-The liner lock looks very strong.  Nice tight lock up when deployed.  I like that not only can I open the blade with one hand, but I can also press the liner lock, and close the blade with one hand as well.-The BEST thing I like about this knife is the Foilage Green handles!  I wish the blade was black with the green handles...but again, not a deal breaker at all. The green is sweet! Pic's online don't do it any justice.  It's not a bright green at all. But not a dark OD Green either.  As I said, I wanted something that wasn't SO TACTICAL. My Streamlight ProTAC flashlight is black tactical, same as my Tac Force karambit, AND my SOG multi-tool!  I just wanted to tone down the Tactical Operator look of my EDC.  The foilage green makes this knife less imposing, in my opinion.-And finally...it was super sharp right out of the box! I ran it on a ceramic sharpener when I got it just to take off some of the burrs...but VERY sharp.Overall I love this knife!  So much so, that I'm already looking at the Spyderco Manix 2.  THAT knife is on the higher end of my budget, I'm trying to stay under the $50 mark for my EDC blades, but I might make the exception for the Manix 2 (AFTER I buy the SOG Flash 2!!) Here's something I don't get: I've seen tons of reviews here (just click on all the 1 or 2 star reviews) that talk about how bad this knife is or how it pales in comparison to other brands, or even other Spyderco knives.  Here's my thing: Hell, if you were expecting to get the same quality as an Endura or Paramilitary...why didn't you just buy THAT??!  This is a $36 dollar BUDGET Spyderco.  Review it for what it is.  A blade made in China, that is in their budget line of knives. And to that end...it's a GREAT blade for the price. But back to my Spyderco Tenacious in foilage green.  Great price, great knife!Buy it, Use it, LOVE it. You won't be disappointed.  *And if you ARE...go buy a Benchmark and be happy .
It works...but for some reason it seems like it&#699;s not quite as &#34;billowy&#34; or as &#34;full&#34; as regular fog juice.  I bought this to try it out, and see the difference.  It&#699;s not bad.  But it&#699;s not great either.  Don&#699;t get me wrong...I&#699;m not unhappy at all.  Just giving my review in comparison to a regular juice. I&#699;m not really sure what the ECO is, I haven&#699;t looked it up yet, but if it&#699;s a good product that&#699;s good for the environment...it&#699;s good for me.  I&#699;m going to research what the ECO part of it is, and then make another review.BUT...I&#699;d buy it again, especially if it&#699;s good for the environment .
I just picked up TWO of the 7-1/2 inch scissors.  One for my First Aid kit at home, and one for my personal IFAK kit that goes in my truck, hunting, shooting, camping, etc. My first impression was: Wow...this is BIG.  It's a pretty big size shears.  After reading other reviews, it looks like the smaller set might be a little too small for big hands.  I may order a small set for my personal kit, because this one doesn't quite fit inside. I have to strap it to the outside of my kit.  Overall...I like them. I haven't used them enough yet to LOVE them...but I'm sure if I ever have to use them in an emergency...they'll be awesome .
For the price, this is a great item.  I don&#699;t really use the magazine pouches, but I put my Glock magazines in them and they fit great. I ended up putting the pouches on my backpack for things like a flashlight and glowsticks.As for the belt itself.  It&#699;s made well. Buckle seems to be pretty decent.  It&#699;s not a cobra buckle, but for the price, I&#699;ll take it.  I use it as sort of a &#34;duty belt&#34; with kydex pistol and AR-15 magazine holsters on my left side, my little rolled dump pouch towards the back, a kydex Glock holster on my right, with my survival knife just behind the holster. I have enough room to even add a mini blow-out kit.Four stars for another good product from Condor .
If any of you watch YouTube...look up Nutnfancy's review of this light. He says it all...Originally, I was looking at either the Preon-1 or 2, or the Pro Stylus, and ended up seeing this one on the page for the Stylus here on Amazon... so I clicked on it and opened it up.  And I am glad I did!  I was looking for an EDC flashlight that was light enough to carry in my pocket every day, but wasn't going to break the bank in terms of cost, and this fits that role perfectly.  I didn't want to spend more than $30 on this light because I already have an Olight M20 Warrior, and an Olight T25 which I LOVE both...but even the T25 is a little too big for EDC (at least for me).  The Preon 1 is a twist top (to turn on/off) and I wanted a tailcap pushbutton, and that's why the Pro Stylus was my original choice. (I STILL may buy the Preon-1, because for only $32 bucks that thing looks like a powerhouse of a mini flashlight!) However, I ended up going with this one instead of the Pro Stylus due to the higher lumens and it has a high/low/strobe function, which the Pro Stylus does not.  And in comparison to the Preon-1, this was a little bigger, and I didn't want to lose the small Preon.And wow...this thing is awesome for such a little pkg.Pro's (for me):Good amount of light: 80 lumens on high, 10 on low.Lightweight.  I barely notice it's there.O-rings for water resistance. (I think it says it's waterproof down to 3-5 meters or something like that, but I don't intend on diving with it, so that's fine.)Good quality build.Good price: $29 bucks on Amazon, but I've seen it for less elsewhere.I like that it uses AAA batteries, which are readily available anywhere. (There is a AA version of this light as well, if you want a little bigger version!)Con's:I wish the clip was a little higher, so it rides deeper in my pocket.  So I don't lose it.The tailcap button is hard to press.  But I'm finding I might like that so it doesn't accidently get turned on in my pocket or bag.I wish it came in other colors: metallic orange, blue, green, etc.  Then it's easer to find in a dark bag at night.I wish the high/low beams were right next to each other, instead of it being: Hight (single click), Strobe (double click), and Low (triple click).  Put the low before strobe!  I'm sure there is some reason for that.  But it's not a deal breaker by any means.It fits in my pocket right next to my Spydeco Tenacious just fine.  It's about the size of a fat sharpie pen and I barely notice it's there.  In fact since I started carrying it, I have to reach down once in a while to feel if it's still there!So here's what I did at home when I first got it.  I pulled out my large Maglite, my Olight T25, and a no name Asian brand LED light I bought here on Amazon for 4 bucks (I didn't bother bringing out the M20 because that thing is a beast. I turned all the lights out in my living room and tested them by shining them on the ceiling one at a time.  The Maglite and T25 have fairly new batteries, and the little LED has never been used.  So the T25 was brightest, the no-name LED was dead last...and this little Streamlight beat that huge Maglite! In terms of brightness, wide beam...it killed my big maglite! I took my new ProTAC outside and shined it out to where my dogs are (about 20m) and it lit up the whole area.  I don't think it throws 80m as advertised...but it sure does put out a lot of light.If you're looking for a good quality, high lumen EDC light that won't break the bank...this IS IT. Buy it. Carry it.  Love it.  You'll be glad you did.UPDATE:Last night after a gig (I moonlight as a musician) I was walking out along the back of the hotel I was at, back to the parking lot and remembered I had my ProTAC in my pocket, so I pulled it out to test it. It was really dark, almost pitch black, and I must say, this light really lit up the entire area.  So I'll take back what I said above...this light lit up a couple trash cans and boxes that were out at least 60m from where I was!  I shined it down this really long maintenance pathway, and it lit the whole area.  I am impressed more than I was before. If you're looking at the Pro Stylus, take a look at this light as well.  It's a little bigger diameter-wise...but well worth it in my opinion. 10 out of 5 stars .
I got this sprayer with my Duracoat shake n spray kit, and while at first I was a little hesitant about spraying the slide of my glock 34 with this...I am very pleased with the results. I also duracoated my Blackhawk holster, kydex knife sheath, knife handle, 2 AR-15 magpul magazines, my forward grip, AR buttstock and grip.  And I still have a little propellant left over in the canister.  This is just to show you how much I was able to do with just ONE can.As far as spray... YES, an airbrush would have a finer finish. But the finish on this was good.  Actually REALLY good.  My glock slide isn&#699;t completely smooth, and has a fine texture to it.  At first I wasn&#699;t sure about it...BUT, once I put my gun back together and racked the slide, I realized something...NO FINGER PRINTS on my slide!!!!  I&#699;m ALWAYS wiping down my slide because my friends gun has prints on it that are just STUCK now. So I&#699;m constantly worried about that.  But this finish gives my slide an ever so light texture.  And I like that alot.  On my AR polymer stock and grip it came out smooth.  LIke factory smooth.  I&#699;m sure it&#699;s because it&#699;s the polymer.  But it looks really good.  The kydex to it very well also.  l was very pleased with the results.I rated it 4 stars because I like it and I would love it if it were a little bigger, and came with smaller jars.  That way I could clean out the sprayer, and attach different color jars quickly.  Also, because it&#699;s a canned product, you need to be careful to shoot some out after setting it down for a few minutes to prime the paint thru the system.  But it works, and works well enough that I just bought two more of these power units to paint other gun parts.Overall, I would recommend this product to anyone wanting to use duracoat or any other coating application .
For what it is...it&#699;s 5 stars. Yes, it could be better by being linkable to other LED Pulse&#699;s, and I&#699;m sure there are 3 or 4 other ways it could be better...but then the price would go up and it would be a different animal. So, for what it IS...I LOVE it.With that being said, I bought the light because it was fairly inexpensive, and I wanted to see how it performed, and I&#699;m happy to say: it exceeded my expectations.  The LED&#699;s are much brighter than I expected, and this little (it&#699;s actually not THAT little) unit threw nice LED patterns across the hall, no problem. It covered a really large area.  The strobe function is just ok, nothing to write home about, but it&#699;s another effect built-in, and I like that feature alot.  I really wish it was linkable, but like I said above...it would be a different animal.  I think I might buy another unit, and set them up on the bottom of a T-bar, with my mega pixel LED across the top.  Perfect for a small to medium size venue.My gigs aren&#699;t huge where I need scanners or moving heads, but the Reflex Pulse gives the look and feel of a scanner.  If you&#699;re looking for an affordable alternative to a scanner effect, this is a good buy.  Also, I&#699;ve been reading online that Am.DJ is coming out with a linkable/DMX version...but some of those posts were from 2 years ago.  Either way, I&#699;m not sure they&#699;d make it under $150 bucks.If you have questions on it, post them.  I&#699;ll respond as best as I can .
Not much you can say about an Xbox wireless controller other than it works, and my son loves having 4 of them .
I have an AR style buttstock on my Flex 500. This LimbSaver fit perfectly, and it really tamed the recoil on my shotty, even with magnum slugs.  Although...it&#699;s gonna kick no matter what with those!  But...it&#699;s still a lot better than just the plain buttstock pad alone.  I&#699;d definitely recommend to anyone looking to put it on a shotgun .
There are a ton of reviews out there on this particular knife.  It caught my eye on knifecenter.com so I decided to take a closer look and looked at reviews here on Amazon as well as YouTube.  There are some really good reviews on YouTube. Overall I like this knife.  I bought it to give away as a gift, but I may end up buying another one to keep.I bought the straight blade, not serrated, which is what I prefer. I think the blade steel is decent quality.  It&#699;s the same steel as my Spyderco Tenacious, strong enough, and able to sharpen up fairly easily.  I like the handle grip, it&#699;s very good and feels comfortable in hand. No blade play up, down, or side to side when it&#699;s deployed.  I like the secondary lock on the top of the frame.  That&#699;s a nice added safety feature.  I&#699;m not too keen on the pocket clip.  That looks a little...low-tech if I can say that.  I wish it was a little more agressive looking and not so FAT.  And then the knife overall is a little wide.Other than that I have no real complaints.  These are my first impressions right out of the box...and I haven&#699;t actually put it to use, BUT...I can tell this knife will take a beating. The good news: It&#699;s not a hundred dollar knife that I&#699;ll be afraid to put to hard use.I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it&#699;s a little wider than expected, and that silly looking pocket clip .
I was sort of expecting it to be a little small. But that&#699;s my heads fault, not the product.It&#699;s really lightweight, and looks good.  I think the brim part is a little smaller than expected... but good nonetheless .
Yes I gave it 5 stars.  It&#699;s bright. Not just bright...I mean BRIGHT.  It throws light far!  I was helping to set up a couple of big party tents for an event this past saturday morning...at 4:30AM, and and everyone there had a flashlight or headlamp.  When I turned this little guy on..I was completely blown away at the amount of light it had.  I got a few good comments when it was on the med setting...and when I turned it on HIGH...it blew EVERYONE away that it could even step up a notch! I&#699;ve got regular alkaline AA&#699;s in it now...and it&#699;s STILL really bright.  I&#699;ll be buying lithium AA&#699;s and we&#699;ll see how long those last in comparison and if the brightness is different.  I personally really like the wide beam and how much light it throws.  I like that it&#699;s so slim and light but packs a wallop of light! I also like the length of the light.  It fits nicely in my hand and I can operate it easily with my thumb on the button.  Because I live in Hawaii, it was important to me that this light be waterproof, and built to last. We&#699;re exposed to heavy rain, hot sun, ocean spray and salt water... so I wanted a light that I could accidently drop in a puddle in torrential rain.With that being said, the only thing I wish it had is a side switch/button to change between modes like my other Olight: M20 Tactical Warrior.  BUT...that&#699;s not a deal breaker by any means, I STILL LOVE this light.  I don&#699;t mind twisting the upper bezel to get it to change modes. I&#699;m glad that it stays in the last mode you left it in. I think the lowest setting is a little TOO low.  I don&#699;t imagine when I&#699;d use it.  I keep it on the med setting.  I know there are comparable flashlights that are A LOT more expensive and made in the US... and even less expensive flashlights...but I really liked Olight&#699;s torture test, and how much abuse they can take.  My M20 has been so good to me, and I have had nothing but good experiences with Olight, purchasing this T25 light was an easy choice. The hardest part was choosing between the T20 or the T25.  I picked the T25 because of it&#699;s length.  I think the T20 is a little too short for me personally.So it gets 5 stars from me, and it was well worth the money .
So I bought this for my T25 with high hopes.  I've been extremely happy with my T25 as well as my M20 Warrior flashlights.  My M20 is mounted to my AR, but the T25 I've been using as a hand held for night &#34;ops&#34; (ok it's not really op's....just night boar hunting!)  The green filter actually works great.  I like it a lot.  But I don't like the FIT of the filter on my T25.  It's on..but comes off VERY easily.  As one of the other reviewers stated, only the very top of the inside of the filter is what holds it to the flashlight. I wish it stayed on a little tighter.  I'm giving it 3 stars because it's not a bad product overall, as I said the filter part is good.  It's just that I'm afraid I'm going to lose this thing in the bush one night.My fix: I have a roll of 1/2 inch black gaffer's tape that I strapped around the bottom of the filter, and taped it to my T25.  So far it works.  I haven't been in the rain yet...so we'll see.  Another idea I have is to put a rubber band thru the lanyard hole and run that thru the clip, so hopefully if the filter falls off, it's still attached to the light .
OK so there are a lot of people who rag on Condor as "airsoft ONLY" equipment. I completely disagree. Yes, it&#699;s fine for airsoft.  But unless I was going to be deployed...this gear is good enough to do run and gun, or even in a WROL situation it would work fine.  It IS made in China, and yes, sometimes you&#699;re going to run into quality check issues, but for the most part, this rig works great.  And for the price...it earns 5 stars because it&#699;s worth it and then some.  And I know there are a lot of snobs who poke their noses up in the air in regards to Condor, but I have a number of pouches and other gear from them, and I personally think they&#699;re built strong.Now on to the review:I run this chest rig with a Condor rip away EMT bag on my left, and a Condor sidekick pouch on my right, both pouches on either side of the sewn in magazine pouch. I run 4 pistol mags with my flashlight and multitool positioned in the 2 middle pistol mag pouches.  While I can carry 6 AR mags in it, I usually carry 3. With all this gear on, it&#699;s still comfortable enough for all-day use (PLEASE...this is BATTLE GEAR. IT&#699;S NOT SUPPOSED TO BE FLEECE LINED, PARIS HILTON KINDA STUFF!!!) just be sure to set it up right. I&#699;m a big guy wearing a 2x shirt, and this fits me fine.  It would probably fit someone who wears a 3x or maybe even 4x.  (and if you&#699;re a 4x kinda guy...hit the stationary bike once in a while! Trust me, you&#699;ll thank me later.) The molle on this rig fits all of my gear fine, no problems there.  The stitching is heavy duty. Maybe not mil-spec, but heavy duty nonetheless. One thing I like about this rig is that I can put my Condor compact assult pack on my back, and I&#699;m good to go.  *YES...I have a LOT of Condor gear in this loadout but I also have Maxpedition as well as Camelbak equipment on other rigs.So, if you&#699;re being deployed...go with the best you can buy.  If you&#699;re just planning for the zombie apocalypse or run-n-gun training or competition, this will work fine, and you&#699;ll be happy you saved the money.One more thing on Condor:From what I&#699;ve seen and read, their quality has gone up tremendously in the last couple of years.  They&#699;re really making an honest effort to win our business with quality equipment that&#699;s made overseas.  And on top of that, they&#699;ve also started manufacturing some products here in the U.S .
Not a whole lot to say about these patches. I got 5 different ones from Gladsen and Culpeper, and got free shipping.  I think the patches are decently made, with good stitching. The quality on the patches is good, and heavy duty enough.  Not incredibly awesome...but good, and for the price 3 bucks...5 stars because I got 5 patches shipped for FREE .
Ok so this light is NOT 400 lumens.  I&#699;m not sure how they&#699;re getting that...but it&#699;s probably not even 200 lumens.  My Olight T25 which I received in the same order is listed at 210 lumens, and it blows this 400 lumen light away. Next thing that was a little odd: This little flashlight arrived in NO packaging other than a little bubble wrap bag, which was inside of a brown shipping envelope.  There were no packaging or invoice paperwork, no directions, no nothing... But I knew that was probably going to happen based on other reviews I&#699;ve read on this light.  The light is decently bright.  Didn&#699;t blow my socks of by any means.  It&#699;s compact, runs on a single AA battery, and has a decent clip on it.  The focus feature is...nothing really.  I just keep it on it&#699;s brightest setting and leave it.  To cycle between modes you have to quickly press the on/off switch.  I like that it stays in the last mode you had it in.With that being said... I paid 7 bucks for this light with free shipping, and it arrived ahead of schedule, and in great condition.  I cannot really complain because I knew exactly what I was getting.  I gave it 3 stars because it&#699;s just ok.  Nothing special.  Just a decent Cree LED flashlight that runs on a single AA battery.  I would probably buy a couple more to give to my wife/kids to keep in their car/purse/bag. It&#699;s small enough that it doesn&#699;t get in the way too much .
I own a few Condor items: bags, pouches, chest rig... this was the first jacket.  I was a little nervous about buying it online, without actually &#34;seeing&#34; it and putting it on, but I did it.  And I'm glad I did.  I've only had it a couple weeks, but so far I like it. I think for the price, it really gives a lot.  I needed something that would be wind resistant, and offer rain resistance, that was lightweight and breathable. I think this jacket covers all of those needs.  I don't believe it is waterPROOF, but I think it's resistant enough for what I intend to use it for: Hunting, shooting, backpacking in Hawaii.As others have said in their reviews, the zippers as quality as I'd like, but they're ok.  I didn't see any frayed seams or anything like that, and the jacket seems to be well constructed.  For a sub $100 jacket, I think it's well worth the money.Don't compare this to a North Face, Columbia or Patagonia jacket...that's not what this is. You won't get THAT kind of quality and weather resistance in this jacket that's half the price!  Nor is this jacket mil-spec. Don't expect that either.It's an $89 jacket that offers a LOT for that $89 bucks .
This is exactly what I wanted for my Mosin.  It&#699;s the kit, and only thing missing is the little oil container. But no big deal... I run my boresnake thru it instead.  But I got it for the spacer tool for the bolt assembly.  Works good .
This kit has all the stuff you&#699;ll need, (and some stuff you don&#699;t) and it wasn&#699;t extremely expensive.  The only thing I added was an airway for CPR, and some extra bandages of different sizes, and a small tube of antibiotic. There are bandages and single use antibiotic packs...but I needed more.  I use this kit for a summer program in Hawaii, and our kids are always getting small cuts and scrapes because we&#699;re outdoors quite a bit. So bandages and antibiotic are the first to go.I think it&#699;s well laid out, everything is clearly marked, and the clear plastic helps a lot when you&#699;re trying to find stuff. I also like the bright orange color and large print: MEDICAL KIT on the side, makes it easy to locate.  I would recommend this kit to anyone who is going to be outdoors on the water or in the mountains. I gave it 4 stars because I had to add those items, and I&#699;ll probably have to add some sunburn treatment (aloe gel or other), and an instant ice pack or 2, but other than that this kit is good.On a side note... yes I probably could have put together a kit of exactly what I needed so there wouldn&#699;t be any wasted space or unusable items, for about the same price or less...possibly.  But I knew going into this purchase that I was going to add a few things to supplement this kit for my needs so no big deal.  And I was impressed by the layout of the bag, and it&#699;s content.  If you want to see what&#699;s inside, Adventure Medical&#699;s website has some really good video&#699;s on all of their kits .
This fits the Trailmaster Limited perfectly.  I live in Hawaii so I need a cover that is medium to heavy duty, that will keep rain (and in turn...RUST) off my smoker.  I&#699;ve seen a number of YouTube videos of smokers that are totally rusted from being left out in the rain.  If you have a Trailmaster Limited, it fits perfectly and it&#699;s priced right.  The Amazon price was actially less than it is at my local Home Depot.  No tax and free shipping.  Can&#699;t go wrong there .
I bought this knife based on reviews I found on different forums and YouTube. Just google or search YouTube, you&#699;ll find a TON of information and reviews on this knife.  One of the best reviews is by Nutnfancy on YouTube.  Here&#699;s my thoughts:BLADE:AUS8 steel.  It&#699;s decent steel... Sharpens up easily, and keeps an edge.  It was extremely sharp out of the box, and I personally prefer FFG blades, so that was another plus for me.  Nice jimping on the top of the blade that helps with grip when cutting.  The thumb studs are solid.  When closed, the blade on my knife sits exactly centered.  NO blade-play whatsoever.  Up, down, left, right...it&#699;s solid.  The satin finish is nice.  I like how the RAT logo contrasts on the blade.  Very cool.  (I&#699;ve seen reviews on the black finish, and people are saying that it comes off way too easily, and really is there just for looks.  So I&#699;ve decided to stay away from it.) The blade has a nice belly, and is shaped for a lot of different utility tasks.  The blade shape and FFG is one of the main reasons I looked at this knife in the first place.  Well, that and the price.HANDLES:Another reviewer said these were G10.  I don&#699;t think so, and I don&#699;t remember what I read in the blade review forums...but I think it&#699;s Zytel or something.  But it feels like G10.  The finish is really nice on the handles.  The finger choil up front is deep, and it fits my finger in nicely.  It gives good solid control in hand.  It&#699;s not as grippy as my Spyderco Tenacious, but it&#699;s in that same style: sort of a smoothed out grip.  I&#699;m not sure how it will hold up covered in blood (I hunt wild boar) or even just water...that remains to be seen, but I don&#699;t think it will be a problem. (I&#699;ll update this review if it is) I really like the coyote color.  It complements the satin blade very nice.  IF it were G10 handles, the knife would be even MORE AWESOME.  But then again...the price on this knife would probably jump as well.BUILD:Well made. Torx screws hold it all together and the pillar/liner construction looks strong.  I don&#699;t mind that this knife is made overseas.  It&#699;s well done. (Good quality control in manufacturing) I know others have said this, and I agree...if Ontario would have skeletonized the steel liners, that could shave an ounce off the weight.  But the weight (5 oz I believe) is fine to me.  It doesn&#699;t feel that much more heavier than my Spyderco Tenacious in my pocket.CLIP:I like that the clip is 4 way adjustable.  Tip down, Tip up, left, right... you can set it up the way you want.  A definite plus. It&#699;s a long clip too and sits relatively deep in the pocket. The only thing I don&#699;t like is that black paint. I felt that a stainless clip would match the blade better. I&#699;ve seen pics and videos of this exact knife after a year or two of use...and the chipped black finish on the clip looks kinda cool... gives it that &#34;Boba Fet&#34; worn in battle tested look.  So it&#699;s not a deal breaker, and I think over time it&#699;s going to give this knife some personality. If I end up not liking that look...I&#699;ll just take the clip off and buff off the black finish myself.  Easy enough.EDC-ability:It&#699;s a little big for a TRUE EDC knife in my opinion.  But to me, a TRUE EDC blade would be a Kershaw OSO Sweet, or Spyderco Dragonfly, or something similarly sized. (Those are the two I own and carry as EDC, so they&#699;re my only comparisons) BUT, lately I&#699;ve been carrying larger sized blades: Spyderco Tenacious, SOG Flash 2, and now the RAT-1. I don&#699;t feel it&#699;s too big at all. I like that it&#699;s a little bigger, and my EDC blades become medium sized tactical folders. So, YES on the EDC-ability for ME.It was $40 dollars which is a little more than I wanted to pay, (I was hoping for around $30-35) but it&#699;s fine...I figured it was due to the demand for the coyote brown.  For the price...this knife is STILL a very good deal.  Regardless of it being made in Taiwan...it&#699;s well built.  It blows my mind that there are folks comparing this knife to other more expensive blades and complaining about the steel, or not being made in the US, or the lack of G10 scales...??!!  IF this knife were to be made that way...it would be MUCH more than $40 dollars!  So judge it for what it is.  It&#699;s a $40 dollar knife that will take whatever you throw at it.  AND it has a limited lifetime warranty.  Not bad for a budget folding knife made in Taiwan.  (And the plain black handle version can be bought right here on Amazon for $27 bucks!!!)If you&#699;re looking for a HIGH value, MID sized, LOW (to MID) priced, budget (IMO) folder...the Ontario RAT-1 fits that bill. It&#699;s well worth the price. 9 out of 10 for me.  *If the clip was stainless, and the liner skeletonized to drop weight...DEFINITE 10 at $40 bucks for the Coyote handles, and $27 for the black handles!!! Get one .
There are SO MANY reviews on these headphones, and you&#699;ll get all kinds of technical reviews.  But here&#699;s my take:These are good.  There are a few people who say they&#699;re better than Beats...I don&#699;t know about that.  My Beats are great and these are close but not quite. IMHO. Keep in mind, these are &#34;Extra Bass&#34; headphones.  So the bass frequencies are going to have a lot more presence due to the fact that these are tuned that way.  So... don&#699;t expect them to have a flat EQ response across the board.  They&#699;re GOOD, and for $39 bucks...that&#699;s GREAT!  So they get 5 stars for that reason.Let me also say this: I&#699;ve got a pretty big dome.  My fitted cap size is 7-3/4.  Yea Yea Yea...I know.  BUT, I wanted a set of headphones that wouldn&#699;t squeeze my head, or a set that I didn&#699;t have to open them to their farthest most position to wear them.  These... 2-3 clicks on each side, and I&#699;m good.  Oh...and that was a nice touch too.  The little &#34;clicks&#34; so you can be sure they&#699;re even on both sides.IF you&#699;re someone that doesn&#699;t like bass... then don&#699;t get these.  You&#699;ll be tweaking your EQ all day, every day.  I personally like the deeper freq response.  And what I did was set my EQ flat from the lowest freq&#699;s, and then a little higher on the high freq&#699;s.I would recommend this buy to anyone with a big size noggin&#699; looking for headphones that don&#699;t squeeze or pinch your head .
I&#699;ve used this multiple times on my smoker, as well as my grill.  Hasn&#699;t failed me yet.  Did a tri-tip with it to perfection on my grill.  I cannot tell exactly how accurate it is, but it&#699;s close enought to my needs.  I like the ability to use both probes, and I also like how it will tell you if the temp in my smoker drops below 220 or if it gets too hot.  For the price...it&#699;s well worth it.I&#699;ve seen reviews saying how its inaccurate or it gives weird readings... mine hasn&#699;t yet. It could be just a bad unit.  But since this was sold and shipped by Amazon, I had no worries about being able to return it for a replacement.  So...make sure it&#699;s being sold and shipped by Amazon..and buy with confidence .
Ok so when I saw this I was really skeptical, even with all of the good reviews. I wasn't sure that this little angled speaker could put out decent sound...BUT IT DOES! it doesn't sound tinny or weak....and holds up to louder volumes and doesn't distort when you think it will.The first day I got it, i was supposed to do a workout class in a room with a 70" TV. Unfortunately someone else booked the same room and had 25 people in there for a workshop....so i moved my little workout group of 8 to another room without a TV. I hooked this up to my computer and played the workout DVD (Insanity!) where the instructor is giving directions AND there's music playing...and we had NO PROBLEM hearing all of it.  The room was FILLED with sound! It was the tiny 15" screen that was difficult!Sure it's not a Bose speaker, or Beats pill, or the new Sol Republic deck.... But for only $39 bucks....I can buy FIVE of these little babies for the price of ONE of those. It just so happens that I saw the commercial for the Sol Deck on the same day I ordered this...and I said to myself: if this doesn't perform, I'll return it. So  I kept the packing material just in case. But after that first emergency use.... I'm sold. I threw all the packing stuff away and I'm keeping it! I can already forsee using it on the beach, poolside, with my laptop when watching a movie, etc.Look... It's bluetooth, battery operated, compact, and inexpensive. It'll even function as a handsfree speaker for your phone! And did I say it was only $39 bucks??!!  BUY WITH CONFIDENCE.  And if you&#699;d rather spend $200-300 bucks on a Bose, Beats, or Sol, go ahead and do it if that&#699;s your budget or preference.  For me... $39 bucks is GREAT, and I won&#699;t worry if it gets wet or banged around in my computer bag .
Ok, so this is the 3rd one I&#699;ve purchased. I own one, and I&#699;ve given two as gifts.Here&#699;s my take... bass is nothing to write home about.  However, this unit is MUCH better than my phone speaker, so when listening to music on my phone...THIS little oontz is better than what I have.  Does it match the sound quality of a Bose or JamBox?  C&#699;mon... let&#699;s be real.  NO.  But then again, I didn&#699;t spend $200 bucks on it either!  And it&#699;s inexpensive enough, that I bought THREE of them, two to give away.  And the teenagers who have the other two...LOVE IT!The one negative I have is that I don&#699;t believe it actually lasts 10 hours on ONE charge. (I think it says that on the manual I got, but I may be mistaken)  I think it&#699;s more like 6-8 hours. Still though... It&#699;s worth $39 bucks.  If you want something that&#699;s better than your iPhone or Android phone speaker... Get this, and buy with confidence.  If you want better bass, and fuller sound reproduction...then buy the Bose.  For me... $39 bucks for something I can throw in my bag and go to the beach with...or give 2 away as gifts...PERFECT!Update:One odd thing... so these two didn&#699;t come with the little carrying bag.  Not a deal breaker, but my nephews both said the bag wasn&#699;t in the box.  Mine came with a nice little felt bag that you&#699;re able to carry all of the cables in, but theirs didn&#699;t.  Like I said, not that big of an issue, if mine hadn&#699;t come with one, they wouldn&#699;t have even noticed but since it did... they brought it up .
You can't beat the price.  My daughter collects old cameras so I decided to get this necklace for her.  I was pleasantly surprised by it .
This book was really good. It made me never wanna stop reading. When I had finished the book I didn't want it to end, I wanted to keep reading. In all it was  a great book that makes you wanna keep on reading .
didn't work properly had to mess with the cable. but as they say, you get what you pay for. customer service was rude and not reliable. will not buy from these jerks again. refused to give me my full amount of money back. geuss thats why they are poor saps .
Its a great product perfect for my mother's phone plus it fits perfect had no problems at all. K k .
If you like doing nail art, this is a great book! It doesn't have any tutorials, but if you know basic nail art tricks, you can easily recreate the pictures. The designs range from classy and elegant to fun and colorful. This book is a great resource when you're not really sure what you want to do with your nails! I really love it .
I bought this striping tape thinking I could use it for making designs and creating perfect stripes. When I got it I was so excited. It was easy to place down on my nail. However, when I put the top coat on, some of the color from the tape was gone. Then the tape began lifting and peeling off. I ended up just painting over the tape and peeling it off to create lines. By itself, the tape is not a good nail art tool. When used to make other designs on your nail and then just peel off the tape, though, it works better .
This is a fantastic read with a sweet story and the beginnings of a great tale of love and romance. The hope and joy of the characters drive a very uplifting journey. I could not stop smiling .
the system of mac is not that hard to learn, you can get used to it in two days. it is a brandly new operating experience. i love it .
First of all when I received the flat iron I immediately wanted to try it out. Upon turning it on it filled my whole house with a stench of burning plastic. I thought well its brand new maybe it'll go away. It didn't. The smell occurs every time I turn it on.Also I have thin slightly wavy shoulder length hair. It doesn't take much from a flat iron to straighten my hair. However with this useless iron it takes me at least 45 mins to get my hair straight and then about thirty minutes later (after my hair completely cools) it is right back to how it was before I flat ironed it.This iron doesn't get up to 430 degrees I don't care what the description says. It also pulls and yanks out my hair.Just turn away right now. If you would like a good flat iron I replaced this piece of crap with a jilbere porcelain flat iron. Works amazing! And it's not that much more expensive. I suggest looking that one up!Happy shopping .
This thing is awesome.  Between this and my Galaxy Note I can get just about anything done.  I don't use my laptop any more .
My wife and I had some really crappy wifi out of our internet provider router but now we can go just about any where in our house and still be connected.Setup: This item was really easy to set up. By plugging this into the wall and connecting using your laptop you simply type in the URL included in the manual and you will have access to all the settings of the device! This takes 5-10 mins to set up as an extender or router.Dual Purpose: This can be used as an extender as I am using it for or it can be set up as a new router. I have tested this as a new router, and it worked amazing. I decided not to keep this set up as a router because I was just needing internet on a single device. If you have multiple devices being used on your internet setting it up as a router would be a great idea.Design: This is very solidly desinged and also looks very stylish. It has indication lights to let you know it is working and also has a ethernet port that you can use to set up a direct wired connection to your computer after you extend the range of the internet.Overall this item is great and really helped me get my internet working around my whole house! The best part of this item is you can unplug it and take it to a different room without having to set it back up as a repeater. This is a mobile wireless point so you can always have the best connection possible without having to worry about losing internet .
Received game is random case with scratch and actual (what appear to be food) stains on it. Honestly baffled by this, at least clean the disk. Also game doesn't work .
I couldn't finish the book because I was flipping through too many pages because it was going into much detail about their sex lives. It is not necessary to go into all that detail, leave something to the imagination. I would not recommend this book .
I loved this book! I can't wait to read the rest of the series.  I had a hard time putting the book down and when I did, I couldn't wait to pick it back up.  Kristen Proby is one of my favorite Authors .
Wow!! I loved this book as much as the others. When I bought Come Away with Me I couldn't put it down and when I finished it I had to buy the others to read.  This series is the best so far.  Will and Meg have such chemistry together. I like how Will is interested in Meg when she shows him she isn't interested in him in the beginning. Then once he goes to the hospital where Meg works to visit the Children's ward, things start to get interesting. Their relationship has there ups and downs but in the end they fall so in love with each other that you can't help but fall with them.  I like how Kristen Proby writes about the other characters, Luke, Nat, Jules, and Nate in each book. I love reading about this family, keep it going Kristen, the Montgomery men are worth reading about .
I received the printer quickly and was very easy to set it up.I was surprised to not have a printer cable though but that was OK .
I am just learning how to manage cooking times, but, I love its portability and ease in cleaning. I would recommend for anyone who is not a big barbecue expert .
Not typically the type of book I read but a friend was reading it and highly recommended it. I downloaded it and finished it in a day! I couldn't put it down (except I had to for work and my 1 year old) I loved this as well as the short book on Fallon. Can't wait for the next .
I thought this case would cover more of my phone but it only covers the back. Not very protective. The description also didn't mention it is sheer therefore making the design black and purple rather than white and purple like in the picture since my phone is black. You get what you pay for .
Works great! No problems at all. Definitely worth the price! I would recommend this product to anyone who needs an extra nun-chuk .
I love the books. I bought these after watching the first movie. I am glad, the books are even better. I couldn't put them down .
I love the wallet. I got it for myself. I bought along with a Tommy watch and the look great together. Tommy Hilfiger Men's 1710294 Stainless Steel and Leather Strap White Dial. Trust me u won't be disappointed .
Didn't fit my tab. the worst is I never got my money bay because it half the purchase price. Don't do it .
I love this watch. Get compliments all the time. I have a small wrist and this fit prefect but I put on my Dad and he is larger still looks excellent.. Great price. You really can't beat Amazon's prices .
Look at Dakine size chart and you will know what size you are. These gloves are great. All the extra features are awesome. I can't wait to use them .
These bag is made of great material. Looks fantastic. I am taking it skiing these week for the first time and can't wait. I fit a pair of ski boots, 2 ski pants, 2 goggles, 2 gloves, 2 hats, and a face mask. Everything fits perfect. 74L .
I hate this helmet it is cheaply made. It is not worth it even if you are getting paid to receive it .
This duvet cover is extremely soft I absolutely love them to death. But there was one thing I didn't like the button that keep the insert in were not sewn on great when I put the insert in for the first time two buttons came off .
These pillow are amazing they are what they say they are. If you are a stomach sleeper then you will not be disappointed but if u sleep any other way guess what I think you won't be unhappy either. Great pillow .
Works great!!! Take your time putting on. Micro bubbles will work themselves out. Follow instructions its very important. Very strong. Note: I did have a problem with microbubbles the first one they worked there way out but left a white spot. I sent back to Amazon and received a new one. Amazon is great when it comes to returns. Overall you can never go wrong with this site I really buy verything but food from here lol .
Fits like a glove. Not to bulky. Just enough protection for your phone. I have dropped my phone a few times and have had no problems .
Awesome thing to have for trips or even if you are just in an area where there is no outlet or charger. The one bad thing is that you have to take you cover off to charge phone because of the large output port .
Very nice and beautiful.  Easy to put together. Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because my GSD/Dobie figured out how to open the gate in no time at all .
It is cute but sitting on it is not as comfortable as i had hoped. I wouldn't buy another one .
Heavy and big it is not for petite women or for dressy affairs.. After saying that I really like it as it beautiful and very fascinating .
Not pretty but does the job of keeping the glare off so I can see the screen .
Very smooth, moisturizing with very littlescent.  Haven't been really in the sun yet to see how the spf protection is .
Very sticky and goopy. Doesn't work well with makeup. I will not order again .
Nice neutral color but I guess I need a good primer as it didn't last very long at all .
Didn't stay on like the Blinc liquid liner does .
I love this game. It was a great price and not expensive and the disk was so clean... great game... can't wait for gta 5 .
Very pretty hand bag, its kinda small, doesn't fit alot of stuff, but would definetely buy again in other colors .
The pijama is nice, but it says 2T and the top part came way to small like if it was for a new born and the bottom part wayy to big. Not happy at all .
the ventshade on the passenger window won't allow the window to go all the way up unless you hold it out,other then that I like the way they look but would not buy another set for this vehicle .
I enjoyed reading this..Judy wrote with such passion AND humor. I recommend this reading for anyone going through cancer. Judy says it's not the end of the world !Suzanne (Roanoke, VA .
I LOVE Julie Lessman's new book, Love at any Cost.  This book is ANOTHER AMAZING, SUSPENSEFUL, and PASSIONATE work by Julie Lessman.  I have read all of Julie Lessman's previous books, and this one exceeds the rest.  This book is realistic, has twists and turns, and DEFINITELY NOT PREDICTABLE.  I don't want to spoil anything, but the book had my rapt attention during the whole entire book.  Julie describes everything and makes you feel like you know the characters and setting.  You feel as if you are in the middle of the book while you are reading it.  Julie has the AMAZING ability to portray the characters as if they were your best friends.  I truly love this book and recommend this to anyone and everyone.  Abby R .
This is a great book to read!it goes through the tough times of the main character ,ever,and  her battle with the voice in her head called skinny that tells her she isn't good enough but she overcomes it and gets the actual good guy and the lead role .
I loved this book im 12 and it was great!! I loved how it showed it was like a real life not sappy and stupid like some it showed that all true friends will come through in the end .
The carabiners were everything they were supposed to be. They're well with the price and so long as you're not climbing Everest, they'll do .
These bags do not fit the Sentria model!!!! Type F is not the right type for Sentria! Don't believe the description .
Very Cute! And perfect for my 9 year old nephew to make his own Chocolate Milk with! I gave a 4 star because I am not sure the cup will last long. As it seems sort of weak. But it does its job for now!!! Great price for the Moo Mixer .
I really like this item.because when I was in the class, if the record pen do not have battery, i will missing a lot, but the external battery helps me a lot, I will never worry about that .
IT HELP ME TO USE MY IPHONE LONGER. I CAN USE IT DURING MY FLIGHT AND NEED NOT WORRY OUT OF BUTTERY .
Nassim Taleb writes in a very authoritarian voice.  His tone is frequently at once both pompous and arrogant.  The man is brilliant and he knows it.  He is not shy about letting his reader know it either.  Taleb is brutally contemptuous of those he violently disagrees with being mostly what he terms charlatan and/or fragalista, highly-educated, academic economic pundits that prostitute themselves to business and/or government to perpetuate stupid, destructive ideas and outright fraud either knowingly or unknowingly.  The actual premise of "Antifragile" is quite simple in many ways and could essentially be explained in a couple of pages quite thoroughly.  Taleb takes over 500 pages to discuss the concept going all the way through the Index.  The man is multi-lingual and extremely well read, particularly in the classics.  There are hundreds of references throughout the text to works of literature from different centuries, cultures and languages.  Frequently, the connection to the main theme of the book seems a bit stretched but the vignettes are almost always quite interesting and thought provoking.  Taleb has strong opinions on a wide variety of topics and presents them as facts in a harsh, clipped fashion.  Much of what Taleb proclaims is quite outside the norm and at odds with conventional wisdom.  As soon as I started reading "Antifragile" I could not stop and read the entire book in one long sleep-deprived session with minimal breaks to walk my dogs.  I savored many passages with feelings similar to scraping the fatty delicious meat off the bone of a perfectly charcoal-grilled T-bone steak with my teeth.  I wanted to reread the book immediately but will force myself to wait a minimum of one year before doing so that I can think about the concept of antifragility using my own references and experience without the bombastic voice of Taleb pounding inside my head.  "Antifragile" is probably the best book I have ever read.  It is certainly the most important.  I won't attempt to summarize the main theme of "Antifragile".  I would prefer that people read the book for themselves.  I believe every rationale person on the planet should read this book.  If people applied the concept of antifragility as defined in great detail by Taleb their lives would become happier and more successful.  If the world were ruled by numerous city-states governed by the concept of antifragility our planet would become a safer more productive place.  Poverty and hunger would be largely eradicated.  The global economy would be much healthier and there would be little war.  The threat of nuclear holocaust would diminish exponentially.  Nassim Nicholas Taleb has written a book that could significantly change the world for the better.  There is no greater achievement available to an author .
"Live from Mongolia" by Patricia Sexton is a fun book with a powerful message to embrace your passions and follow your dreams.  Ms. Sexton walks away from a lucrative, although high-pressured career as a Wall Street banker to become an unpaid intern at a Mongolian television station.  As an ex-investment banker I can appreciate and admire this gutty decision.  The author uses her natural reporter's eye to paint a vivid picture of her adventures in Mongolia.  She deftly mixes in history with her personal narrative to educate and entertain the reader.  After returning to NYC, Ms. Sexton briefly returns to Wall Street, but swiftly realizes that she can no longer sell out for money.  The price is too high and there is too much to lose to walk away from her new passion in life.  This book would make a great Christmas present for high school and college students struggling with what to do with their lives.  The lesson is simple.  Throw caution to the wind, follow your heart's desire and give it everything you got .
Wall Street Journeyman is a remarkable book.  The novel takes us through the life and times of one man's journey to significant success on Wall Street trading desks and the subsequent decline in his career.  The vivid descriptions of his youth and the violence he and his family experienced at the hands of his father are graphic and chilling.  But his relationship with his father was very complicated and the specter of his old man haunts him throughout his life.  The protagonist is obviously brilliant and we hear his thoughts and feel his passion as he rises rapidly in the industry early in his career.  We see a man that is capable of great compassion and kindness, but also ruthless, aggressive behavior.  The protagonist is often quite reckless, but handles adversity with courage and conviction.  He is a man capable of twisted, decadent actions, but also someone that possesses a keen sense of humor and is brutally honest with himself throughout the saga.  The story is full of unexpected twists and turns with significant doses of dark humor.  The description and analysis of the financial industry is excellent.  The reader gets a first-hand look at the phenomenon that was Wall Street during the past twenty-five years.  We learn the kinds of money made by Wall Street professionals and the organization and business strategies of these firms.  We get a true inside look at the industry along with detailed descriptions of the crazy shenanigans and excesses these young, highly paid professionals got involved with.  Wall Street Journeyman is a triumph.  I strongly recommend taking the journey .
I bought this product after reading an article about it but was very disappointed. It did nothing at all for me. No weight loss, no curbing of appetite, nothing. What a waste of time .
This product is awesome. I did not expect it to work this well. I use it every chance I get .
This mouse was a major improvement from my old dell wired mouse that I've had for years. It is very lightweight and have 3 sensitivity settings that were very useful. The mouse itself isn't very comfortable in your hand, but like with everything else, you get used to it. I've had this mouse about 8 months when it started to act up. The left and right buttons would start to double click or sometimes wouldn't click at all. There doesn't seem to be anything wrong with the actual buttons, it might just be that the sensor inside the mouse is going bad. It gets very annoying when playing games and greatly affects gameplay. The reason I gave it 4 stars is because you will not find a better mouse for the same price anywhere.P.S. The LED in the mouse stays on even when I turn off my computer which is very annoying and the mouse must be unplugged every night .
The overall design of the mouse is great. It feels very good in your hand and the laser is very precise. Now what I didn't like about it is the weight and the lights. This mouse is noticeably heavier than all the previous mouses that I have owned, which makes it harder to pick up and move but you eventually get used to it. The main reason i gave this mouse a 3 star rating is for the software. It comes with a CD that has the driver for the lights and other settings in the box, but you need to change the name of certain files so that your computer can recognize them because they are originally in Chinese. Another option is to download the drivers in English from Overload Forums, which you have to make an account to get permission to download it. Once you finally get the driver installed, it doesn't even work! The only setting for the lights that does work is the one that cycles through all the colors, which I believe is the &#34;demo&#34; mode. I wanted to change it to solid blue to match my case, but that is not longer an option. Overall, it is a good mouse, but if you are crazy about the lights and being able to adjust setting on the mouse, there are much better mouses out there for this price .
Although I didn't get the chance to actually see XP in action, I received the Windows XP product in brand new packaging and a perfectly clean disc.  This is a professional exchange for a quality product.  Sometimes when buying software, it's hard to know who you can trust .
This costume was BASICALLY what you expect looking at it.  However, the belly was extremely baggy, and I'm by no means a twig.  An average adult male needed to stuff it with pillows to fill it out.  Also the snout droops considerably, which also had to be corrected using a nifty contraption that included a paint stirrer and some grocery bags...and sewing.  You get what you pay for with this costume .
Rise of Nations is still my favorite strategy game.  To give a little more detail than the description, Rise of Nations allows the player to take control one of over 20-something different nations and wage war against others through 2,000 years of history spanning several &#34;ages&#34;.  Conquer the world through force, diplomacy, technological advances in campaign mode, or just play quick battles with detailed pre-sets including population limits, starting age, enemy difficulty, dozens of maps, and diplomacy.  Not sure if the online multiplayer is still supported but it's not really necessary to have a great time.  Nevertheless, it's also a fun time .
The wig is very smooth and brushes out well! The bangs have a lot of hair and will most likely be trimmed. The netting does not show in the wig and the length feels natural. The shine looks natural and the wig fits nicely. Great value for the price .
Its a toy. Would not want to claw my way out of a wreck with this thing... There has to be better .
Baby girl will play with this for hours!!! Absolute favorite toy until she disembowels it. No mess - just beware the squeaker if the dog was to swallow it .
Mass produced Chinese mount - a bit sketchy. Different as pictured and does not have the bolt - only thumb screw. Was banged up pretty good as well with corners missing paint. Rock solid for kids airsoft playtime, you can do way better for real AR builds. Little GGG mount is bomb proof and made in America! Return was challenged by Amazon .
Very fast - straight forward install. Cannot comment on longevity. So far so good. Very good reputation on this particular drive with full 5 year warranty. FYI - cheaper Samsung SSD pull back to three years on warranty. Cannot comment on the whole warranty process and hope to avoid it .
Great toy and highly educational.  You can program your childs name so it will call her by name. The only problem I have is that you have to watch so your childs fingers do not get pinched.  Mine loves to open and close things!  Highly recommend .
i was fooled tothink that the bikini attachment was a shaving part as well as no where did it say it isn't. until i received the item and i saw that its just a trimmer and it didnt work on me at all .
it looks nice in my kitchen and serves its purpose well. my bills are finally organized with 1 section for bills not paid, 1 for recent paid bills and the other for important documents to be taken care of .
i found this whisk to be just what i needed. it whisks up those few ingredients in no time and its pretty reasonable too .
It was so exciting. Absolutely stunned by the drama. I could not stop reading it was addictive.Well, James Cavendish is addictive .
i liked the plot, couldn't stop reading it. Wasn't as unreal as other similar books, although it had certain similarities with 50 shades .
I loved everything! It had the best combination of love, drama, sex and thrill. It wasn't so far away from reality, as some other sex novels .
Perfect size and weight.  Exactly what I hoped it would be!  Extremely pleased.  Highly recommend, you will not be disappointed .
Kershaw knows knives. Ken Onion knows knives. You know you want this knife.Came sharp as a razor out of the box. Beautiful knife. Speedsafe is an awesome technology and should be praised for its safety value. This is not Kershaws best knife, but one of the most popular in the world and for good reason .
Excellent, EXCELLENT knife! Very lightweight with the FRN scales, which is NOT cheap plastic as some have said. The swede grind is perfection, coming sharp as hell right out of the box. I would not hesitate to buy this knife again! Fits in the pocket nicely and can barely tell it's there. Doesn't rip your pants either when you pull it out as some G10 handles have the tendency to do(I still like G10 btw) Another solid product from Spyderco .
Fantastic knife. SHARP. Right out of the box. Lifetime guarantee. I use it as my work knife, (apartment maintenance) and I couldn't be more pleased. Came with a sturdy leather holder. Wouldn't hesitate to buy this again, not that I will likely ever need to .
Not bad, very vicious little blade. Came with a few small stains on the blade, which may or may not be a CRKT issue. Doubtful it had to do with the seller. Sheath is a little hard to assemble, and not the best design. I do like the knife though, but not quite what I had hoped for. Still, excellent sharpness and the full tang is nice. Very lite weight also .
Wonderful little case. Very low-profile, fits my Wingman perfectly. Strong little leather, and I love the fact that it has a clasp and not Velcro, which always seems to wear out after a year or so .
Wonderful knife! Razor sharp out of the box, well oiled, excellent finish and gimping. Don't be afraid to purchase this knife .
Package arrived fairly quickly, which was nice. The case itself isn't bad; it fit my phone well enough. Not sure if long term use would scratch it or not because I only use it as a backup in the chance that my expensive case breaks.Good deal overall .
This knife is BIG. Absolutely RAZOR sharp out of the box. Thumb hole (Spyderco's trademark) makes deployment easy as pie. Much better than a thumb stud. Spyderco is second to no one. Buy this product with confidence, but make sure that the size is legal in your state first .
For the money, this is a great knife. Good g10 handle, excellent maneuverability with the blade type, steel holds a decent edge and sharpens easy. Good buy, wouldn't hesitate to buy it again .
Bought it for a friend who does Caving professionally and she loves it. Lightweight, feels like a much bigger knife in hand than it is. WILL NOT RUST!!! Great, great buy .
The screens require a solution to ensure proper adhesion and no air bubbles getting trapped. This solution is not included. If you have such solution already then this is a great product. I however, did not, and had no use for them .
For the money, its really not too bad. I recommend it if you want cheap protection that won't break the bank .
Good knife, just way too big for a pocket knife. The handle is HUGE. LAWKS system is solid; definitely no play in the blade. Good knife overall, but not good for pocket carry. Came with extra clip, which is always nice. For 20 bucks, not a bad buy. Ill keep it in my truck .
Very nice stuff. Strong! I tested it right away with 350lbs of gym weights over my balcony(Don't recommend to those in apartments!) and held like a steel beam .
I can now dance if I want to, cuz I left my friends behind. Cuz friends should dance and they didn't dance so I told them all to go to hell .
Based off of Benchmade design, this is a good knife for the money. A wee bit of play in the blade when locked, but still worth the money. May need to be run through the sharpener and a good stropping when you get it, but that is expected from a &#34;knock-off&#34; knife. Bee is not a cheap brand though, so don't be afraid to purchase. Worth the money .
This was purchased for a s&w40ve with laser sight it does not fit. I ordered this especialy for this purpose .
The recording quality is mediocre. I found it to be contrived. Also, it doesn't follow the instrumentation for the score.Postive elements are: The demo is useful to get one's bearings & some of the accompaniments are well represented.It wasn't a waste of money, for the price it serves a purpose .
KylejustingravelleI can't wait till I go to Tokyo I just want to go on to space mountain in Tokyo,  YOLO .
To boring and I thought people write books better than this. BoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooI can't even describe it, just joking I read it I love it .
i rili shuld give this watch 5stars, judging from the package it came in, quality and condition. got it for my sis and i didn't even av d wrist problem seen in most reviews. but the watch seems to work only wen its being worn(meanin u av to set the watch errfin u take it off) Also, the indiglo light seems to dim after being used a couple of times. Other than this, 9ce watch .
I really wanted to stop using Quicken Essentials.  I was a Quicken 2007 user and as many of you know that came to an end with the Intel chip.  I liked the ability to track investments and other features and Essentials is a really dumbed down version.  With iBank 5 you view your investments using reports.  Awkward in my opinion.  It does a nice job of bringing in ALL my financial info, something that Essentials doesn't do.  I'm updating over 15 accounts.  That said, it takes forever to do this process in iBank.  If you want this to be automatic, prepare to pay for a yearly subscription to IGG Software's Direct Access ($40) or monthly ($5) on top of the $60 you shelled out for the iBank 5 program.  This should be free and part of the program in my opinion.  You can download files from banks and upload them for free but this takes too much time.  The user can't change many view options.  You're stuck with a check book view, 2 lines and taking up way to much screen.  Save your money .
this is simply THE moka pot. it works perfectly, does the job efficiently, and most of all, is easy of maintenance. light and seemingly durable (remember, though, it's aluminium, not steel .
it's pretty comfy, though there are some minor glitches in the design. the ridges are slightly skewed (ca. 1.0mm), but it's not a problem. a pity there aren't more of them, the farthest it can go is ca. 40 degrees .
it's simply a very, very good card. no technical issues, singular design, everything in place and at the right pace. look out for special offers on that, if you can get it at almost the price of a good class 4 card, it's a no-brainer .
Pron: I'm so happy i got mine today, but I'm disappointed because it's not working :(Con: I hook up the cable on my phone and I'd notice that there's a gap like .5 centimeter, meaning it doesn't fit all way in, propably thats the problem? Even though, it says on the description of this product it works on s3 and I'm using s3.Is there anyway to refund my money back or change the product .
Pros:I really like this phone case you can put your credit cards, I don't need to bring my wallet anymore.Cons: Only 3-4 max of your cards that you can put inside .
it shipped quickly, but when I got the earrings to put them in two of the studs fell out.  I did not yank on them so they were already loose .
Great set of crimper and dies for the price,  The case is convenient and stores the crimper and dies securely.  Comes with a wide variety of dies.  It even has a die that will do large AWG insulated cord end terminals.  I believe it can go as large as 6 AWG.  Very hard to find one that does large AWG.  As for the ratcheting mechanism and the crimp, it does not come close to knipex crimpers.  I use the knipex master crimper with die sets almost ever day and there is a huge difference.  The crimp action on the Knipex is almost effortless.  I even have a dedicated ratcheting insulated terminal crimper from knipex and it is day and night compared to astro pneumatic. That damn thing only crimps insulated terminals and it's $130.  The problem is, Knipex will not only break the bank, but it will close your account hahaha.  I paid almost $200 just for the master crimper pliers WITHOUT ANY DIES AT ALL!!!  THE DIES ALONE RUN FROM $100-$200.  Laugh all you want but while you are laughing, I just rewired and repaired a backup generator that provides back up power to hospitals when a natural disaster hits.  I bought this astro pneumatic set as a gift for an employee/apprentice of mine.  He always complains that he has to use the old style crimpers with no ratchet where you actually have to squeeze to crimp.  He has some girly hands for a field engineer.  I tried his set out and I was so glad I didn't go cheap on my own tools.  This AP set is great for the auto mechanic or electrician but not for us engineers that hold life and death in our hands.  Sound pretty over dramatic huh?  I would give it a 3.5 but I will round it up to 4 stars.  Amazon, please try and get the Knipex tool prices to go down a bit.  Thanks .
I loved it! I didn't know what to expect and I'm still thinking &#34;wait, what?&#34;  I identify with so many aspects of this book and i found Tom so likeable even though if you met him in real life that would be debatable. So much more I could say but in a nutshell: congratulations and very well done .
The toilet came extremely well packed, and was right on time.  It was easy to install, with high quality components.  Doesn't come with a seat, but that's not a huge deal.  Even though this was a little more expensive than some others, I'm very satisfied with the purchase .
I got one from my mom and loved it. You can hold it with one finger. It closes tightly to slip in your bag, it fits in the car cup holder, it also is insulated so it doesn't sweat all over everything. But yes I dropped it while getting into my car and it broke, badly! I went back to order it from KMART and they no longer had them. I was sad, but I got the name off of my moms bottle and here it is. I love AMAZON! and am so glad I found my favorite bottle again .
I love rick steves. I have never step foot out of the us but his optimistic approach to travel as well as his low stress attitude make this show a joy to watch. I am so happy to own this collection  and such a deal .
super soft, cups well formed. I actually fell asleep in it the other night which I never do with bras. I can't wait to buy another. Arrived quickly as well. Thank you .
excellent. Thank you Levi's are my favorite jeans. comfortable and flattering. couldn't be more happy with this purchase. would recommend to anyone who wants comfortable jeans that look like a million bucks .
I absolutely love the fit. Levi's are the only jeans that I feel truly comfortable in. I never spend much on jeans or clothing in general but these are my splurge (may not be for many others) but I am on a extreme budget. These are worth every penny. love them .
I am very disappointed because of the length of this item. The width is perfect but it is so short I will probably never wear it. The material is great but unless you are into belly shirts I wouldn't suggest it. I am 5'5&#34; and weigh 140. was thinking it would be perfect but it isn't. Too bad because well made and super cute .
I can't complain because I have worn this every evening since its arrival. However I think I should note that it is not as soft as expected and the color was very very off. I ordered the rust color and it is pictured a very nice dark rusty color. The robe I got was more of a light rust (looked like it had been washed 100 times or more like a primrose. Despite this I really do love and will not return it. The quality is great and I feel I will have it for years to come .
I love this book because it feels like I am in the book with Alex and Connor I am excited for the next book .
This book was awesome. It took me  two weeks to read  the wide awake princess because I could not take my eyes off the book .
At first this was a good purchase I felt but as I continued to use this product (only a few months old) the sound becomes more and more muffled.  You can't really hear any of the sounds at all.  In order to get that muffled sound out you have to turn down the volume very low to where you can't really hear anything.  I am very upset with this product.  I really was hoping that it would work better .
I couldn't put this book down. This author is working up on my list to being one of my favorite authors. I have read 3 of her books this week and have been pleased! It kept me wanting to read more .
This book was a great book. I read it in a couple of hours. I couldn't put it down. Trust me u won't regret buying it. I can't wait for the sequel .
Great looking range hood. the only marks against it is that the fan is much noisier than expected and the lights are not as bright as expected .
This is not a very good facsimile of FB. The screen can not be enlarged. The display does not look like FB on a PC. The only positive aspect is the videos play fairly well .
Three weeks into our new home and no one has knocked.. Of course when you couple this with a &#34;do not knock, do not disturb&#34; sign and a &#34;go away&#34; door mat it sends a pretty clear message .
I spent a lot of time looking for a couple of decent desks for my daughters room. I didn't want the veneer covered fiber board that looks like crap in a year and takes 4 hours to assemble. I also didnt want to spend $500-$700 for a solid wood desk at the local furniture store. Unless you need a hutch or drawers I dont think this can be beat.  Four bolts assemble this and everything lined up, the legs went on in about a minute each, then one screw for the sliding drawer knob, thats it .
I would not believe the other reviewers, these are total junk and had to be returned. The material is paper thin and had torn away from multiple places on both boots, this was new out of the box, not after wearing. There are many good deals on amazon for boots, but this is not one of them. Do yourself a favor and skip these .
MAYBE this would work for the range, but I would never carry this for any reason. The first time that I used it the ball bearing that sits on top of the spring fell out and it no longer stays opened or closed... Its a piece of junk. I have used other speedloaders and own several now, but i would never buy another HKS and never another from Amazon, to many knock-off products lately .
having been overseas for over 9 years I didn't realize that this was sold in the local mega store( think blue vests) so unless you want to spend 3 to 4 times more like I did, do yourself a favor and pick it up the next time your in wally world .
Mesa Tactical is the top of the line when it comes to side saddles. This is SOLID and mounts with no gap between the carrier and the receiver. I am very happy with it .
I got this for a cheap and easy way to heat up water while camping with my kids. I didn't put much faith in it because of the price. It did take quite a while to ship but at this price you can not beat it. I have not used it very hard yet, thats why i am giving it 4 stars, will update it after some serious use. Case is flimsy, but what can you expect .
I bought this for a guest bedroom so i don't know how it sleeps but it seems very comfortable. It is the third memory foam mattress that we have bought online. I think they are way overpriced in the furniture stores ($1000-$2000 plus) and it is the same exact thing, maybe with a different cover sewn on it.I also bought a mattress protector for this and I would suggest you do the same if you are planning on buying it. The only reason that i didnt give it 5 stars is because the cover is a little loose even after over 48 hours of unboxing.We have a 1 and 2 year old that cosleep and they have since birth, they love the memory foam mattresses, you can get up, or they can roll around without waking the other, thats not going to happen with a conventional mattress .
I have bought taps, bits, and this tap wrench from Vermont American and ive never had a problem with any of them .
This thing is rock solid and easy to install on a shotgun. Coupled with a Nebo light its a great weapon light for a home defense gun. You don't have to spend big money to get a great weapon light. I have a surefire with a qd mount but the Nebo has more spill and illuminates the inside of my house better than the much more expensive lights. I CRANKED down on this light mount when tightening it and it didnt break, but realize to get it very secure you are going to have to tighten it a lot. Its going to take you a few minutes to install but once its on, its not going anywhere. I am planning on buying another shotgun in 20ga for my wife. I dont know which gun I am buying yet, but i already know which light and mount it will get. This one .
No patent number on lock, wrong roll pin, no T marks,,, its NOT A MIDWEST INDUSTRIES MOUNT.Just charged me $80 for a $30 knock off.. It is going backWay to many pirated goods on Amazon now, going to shop directly with manufacturers and authorized dealers from now on .
No way to adjust the reticle brightness, is ok in low light but in sunlight it is so bright that it washes out the target and leaves ghost images on your retina,, not good for outdoors during the day, might be ok for home defense, but with no on-off switch your battery might be dead when you hear something go bump in the night.. I would skip it .
Put this on my Mosin M44, it leaves a small gap between the grip and the stock but its tolerable, especially for the money. Easy install, it helps to drill a small pilot hole and to use a screwdriver, don't use a power tool or you can strip out the hole or crack your stock .
I was skeptical about the quality of these because of the crazy low price. I couldn't believe that they were actually better than the brand name polishing pads. They are more dense and stand up to more abuse without the mandrel spinning freely inside them. I will buy again once i wear these out .
These are issue, circa 91. You can not beat it for the price, especially thinking about what our careless government spent on these. If you use a built in magazine pull like the ones on Troy battlemags or the slip on variety such as Magpul magazine pulls, the flaps on this will not even come close to snapping. If your using duct tape and 550 cord, maybe, thats a BIG maybe they will snap close. Its a tight fit. If your using plain pmags, troy battlemags, promag, gi steel mags, or colt mags (all 30 rounders) then they should snap for you.Its not a bad idea to buy 2 of these and keep one loaded and another one full of empty mags that you rotate every 6mo, that way if the S ever does HTF then you should have 7 mags ready to go (one in your rifle), standard combat load for US troops is 210 rounds, 7 mags .
This went on easy and is touch as nails. My kids could destroy an anvil with a rubber hammer and they can't manage to tear this up. They did break the screen on one nabi but this screen protector is holding the broken pieces together and they are still able to use the nabi.Once you start getting decent screen protectors for your electronics you will see the value in them .
I have to give it a 5 star rating because I only paid $39.99 delivered for it. Really the only thing that they could have improved on is the zipper pulls. I fixed that by tying my own with 550 cord (paracord), and they look great, learn how to on youtube if you don't know already.The material is maybe 600D, could be a little thicker especially if your going to load down the large outside pocket. Speaking of pockets its got more than enough of them to keep your stuff organized. I especially like the main compartment dividers and that one of them has a padded compartment for a laptop, touchpad, whatever.I wouldnt have paid full price for it, but if I really had to have it and did pay a hundred or more I wouldnt have felt cheated. At fourty buck delivered it was an incredible deal. I bought one for myself and one to give away. Buy it, you cant go wrong with this bag .
It is good buy just if you are to strong watch the screws. Don't over tightened them because they will break off. Very easy installation .
I just had a great desktop I build but I had no NIC(Network Interface Card) installed and they can get pricey so I'm glad I bought this. It worked perfectly and it's a  cheap solution. It's easy to install and use. I highly recommend it .
I found this book thrilling from beginning to end. Cannot wait to read the rest of her books and others suggested at end .
I liked the information given on why we should or should not consume certain fats, etc.  Dr. Wythe not only gave reasons about topics he also went into detail.  That was my most favorite part of his book.  It would have been nice if the charts were in the book rather than have to go online to retrieve them--that is the only thing I did not like about his book--not having the charts to refer to as I read the book.  I am trying some of the recommendations and menus given--bot not all.  Furthermore, I would recommend this book to anyone intereseted in knowing what they should and should not do to lose weight .
I may have read the information wrong but I did not realize that it came with 2 books of it. Best $10 spent on manuscript paper .
Super comfy and soft! I'm slightly larger in the behind region and thought they might be slightly transparent in the back but they are not. I usually wear a size 7/8 pants size and these fit wonderfully. I have extra room to stretch and there is no camel toe in sight. I highly recommend these .
I would recommend this book to everyone that enjoy s  a clean story. With no bad language. Very good story .
Once. I started reading this book  I couldn't put it. Down. I pictured  the scenes in my head. In other words I  was right there. I would recommend it to anyone that enjoys clean books .
I really enjoyed this book.  I would recommend it to anyone that likes good reading.  I don't like swearing and cussing in the books I read.  This book passes my type of reading .
I didn't appreciate the language. There should be away of knowing the type of language before you purchase. I like clean language. Wouldn't recommend this to my friends. I will stick with authors I know. Jthompson .
Amish blizzards series are just very  short stories.I am disappointed in in them.won,t bother to order any more.  They.  Should be ..one bookYou. No sooner start and you  are finishedI would not recommend them .
Haven't finished this 3rd one but these books do keep your attention. A little surpising with the bedroom graphics but you can't help yourself.  Will there be more? Hope so .
Outfit arrived very promptly but was very disappointed in the lame' cat appique. To me it made the outfit look cheap. Cute outfit if the applique was't that Gold Lame' Stuff. It rjuined it for me.I gave this a 2 star rating because of the applique and the fact that the return date was only 10 days from date of receipt. My fault I guess for not really looking at the outfit when it 1st arrived .
This was a Christmas gift for my 18 month old Granddaughter. It was definately a hit as she doesn't want to quit playing long enough to eat or sleep! Great little kitchen that comes with accessories and any child would enjoy .
this game takes the being bad out of the need for speed series. in the free world mode there is no more reeking havoc and getting chased by the cops. its boring .
Hot hot hot! Congrats Carmen, can't wait for book no. 2!! Fantastic job great writing leaving us wanting much more .
It's not THAT warm but for me it's fine in Toronto. Not great for very deep snow since it's not  long boot, snow may easily get into your feet. But overall, very pretty and comfy boots .
I love Brooke and Remy. I couldn't put it down. I felt like I was with Brooke, watching Remy fight. It was great .
The speed button on the remote.I really love this fan. It is extremely quiet while still putting out a great amount of air movement. I love that it has 5 speed settings. I love that it has a remote. However, right out of the box, the remote will only control power and timer, but the speed button (to me, one of the most important functions because it is used in our bedroom) will not work. It boggles my mind that the other two buttons work, but the speed button will not. I'm not sure who I should contact about this issue, or if it is even covered by the warranty. Anyway, I still love the fan. Having a black fan goes so much better with decor than a white one and helps conceal dust that fans are bound to collect .
very good part.  easy install with factory look.  would purchase again and would tell friends about this product and it was shipped quickly but no charge .
One star because I haven't actually seen the book.....it's just that there were 2 things I did NOT know until I read these reviews:  The first is that I did not know that the real, original, ORIGINAL 1611 KJV Bible contained the apocryphal books (I'm a bit tongue-in-cheek here).  I don't believe that any &#34;KJV Only&#34; people read the apocryphal books--why not?  I also did not know that apparently some people believe even the font size and style is inspired.Now maybe someone, perhaps a KJV Only person, can explain what I do with this dilemma:  I have relatives in France, Germany, and Poland.  They and their parents, etc., were all born in Europe.  They all speak 2-3 different languages.  What version should they be reading?  Would the English be superior and why .
I first read this book well over 20 years ago, so it must have been the original version.  I was young and foolish then (even more so than now! LOL) and I still remember how appalled I was that a woman should shake her curls at her husband, pound her fists on his chest, and have a hissy fit so she could get her way.  How juvenile!  And I suppose I should try that tactic on my employer, the person who serves me in a restaurant, my neighbors, speaking with my child's teacher, etc.  I'd soon be "under observation" somewhere for my bizarre behavior, I'm sure.  I would never EVER recommend this book .
I really thought this item would be different. The sizing was offhand it looked bad on. I'm not sure if I needed to go down a couple of sizes but it just wasn't what I was wanting .
The wallet is perfect. Very small (heightxwidth), fits everything perfectly BUT with only 5 cards, it got really thick and can't even close. Imagina with 9 .
I've been using these eyebrow pencils for quite a few years now. I'm very satisfied with the product. I do miss the handy sharpener at the end of the pencil though, but that just a minor inconvenience .
The rubber bulb doesn't push out the water as well as a plastic bulb from like a store bought douche .
It had all the materials, but the DVD did not work so used is used I guess. Bought a new one .
I was very happy to find this watch for my husband. He works in construction and the real expensive watches don't work for him. He likes this one and if he has an accident with it we can replace it without spending a fortune! He liked it so much I ordered a second one. Thanks for being there .
"Money is the root of all evil" - except the penny! This book will quickly capture your heart and bring back memories as you follow the many adventures of little pennies that are so vividly portayed. The value of a penny is truly captured in the stories of the penny passing through the hands of characters that you will be cheering for. Don't be surprised if you find yourself thinking that you have met people exactly like the characters in the book. The fun penny games and facts sprinkled throughout the book are a great addition to the wonderful stories of each chapter. The stories capture the history of the penny in a way that you will never forget. It is a great gift for all ages and it is truly a keepsake. You won't look at a penny the same way after reading this book .
fit perfectly.  everything I expected.  loved it.  came quickly and  looked amazing on.  I am not a skinny woman either and it managed to lay beautifully over my hips .
the picture is stunning definitely the HD it promises.  I was slightly disappointed to discover they no longer offer the special effects .
i loved it and so did my bf it was the best gift ever and i couldn't have found better in the store .
Cute, lighthearted love story that doesn't take itself too seriously. An easy read that was a good palate cleanse between my usual darker, murder mystery; thriller; suspense; detective story .
Good concept, poor execution. The storytelling showed a lack of experience, and at times just plain incoherent. Poor editing, poor grammar, and the story made no sense. It was completely erratic .
At first I didn't think that this would be as accurate as it said. It just seemed like a fun little app but all the times I've used it its been pretty accurate .
the only problem is that it take forever for someone else to play. Also not evertone is as smart as i am .
Bought this to keep my 2 year old from running down the driveway into the street. So far its been great! Was not difficult to install even having to install one end into cement. Would recommend to others .
The graphics for the Blu ray version are astounding in my opinion any movie made by Spielberg is a movie worth watching for the tech they had back then they did a lot of good work the dinosaurs look astounding and realistic the animatronics are fantastic whenever the t rex is in a scene it has power and feel to it and will have any child gripping his chair with white knuckles the soundtrack is amazing and beautiful it has the large feeling that was mandatory for a movie like this I am going to say that in my opinion Jurassic Park is the best movie ever .
I heard a lot about this movie and was gonna be mad if it wasn't as good as the hype was so I did have high expectations and it exceeded them the story for this movie was intriguing and awesome it's refreshing to get something different from the copy and paste save the princess story he characters were funny and interest in you actually care for them there is a lot of singing but it is a Disney movie and that's nothing new compared to snow white or beauty and the beast or even tangled .
Totally disappointed, they sent me the wrong set for my phone. the plug-in does not fit my phone a Pantec Breeze 111 p2030. I did not bother to return it because of the cost in paying S&H to/from. Very disappointed, I was really looking forward to getting a quality product that fit and worked .
I can't wait to read the next one and I really enjoyed this book. I strongly recommend to take it and you will definitely like S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Captives of the Zone. Hope the new one will be announced soon .
i digged everything just not the bridge. had to order a new one online. also i didn't like that the bridge kept popping out everytime i kept tryin to tune it. overall i like the body work, color, and style .
Bought this Item in June 2013. The first time i used it, it was working pretty good except that i noticed for a fact that the pedometer didn't work at all. THEN i noticed that after 15-20min of using it the machine felt &#34;loose&#34; per say didnt quite gave me a challenge so then i noticed these markings next to the hydrolics and decided to see if that was the cause of the problem and no it didnt fix anything. I tried the machine a couple more times before i actually gave up on it and after a 2 weeks this hook that locks the stepper with the machine broke off which made the machine useless after that. Want my opinion dont buy it save your money for something better. I'm actually going to throw mines away .
Honestly i didn't like it. If youre a busy person who constantly checks her phone for messages or maybe just to look at the time . this product is NOT for you. You would constantly need to be fliping the protector off and in busy moments that gets really frustrating. Just my point of view .
Bought it for my Azus tablet so far works good. Its not 'bulky'or 'rubbery' so its not a hassel to deal with .
The case fits good, but does not stand up to good it is very flimsy when you try to sit it up .
The sound allowed still seems really loud to me.  I wish I could control more and make it even quieter.  It gets loud enough for them to say it hurts their ears if we're not careful enough to make sure the volume is down from the beginning .
I got tired of my mascara running when prepping food for guests.  These definitely do the trick.  If the fumes are really strong they can still burn my nose a bit, but overall these glasses have made chopping onions so much more enjoyable.  I tried all the other tricks...running under cold water, putting onions in the freezer shortly, or in the fridge etc.  None of them kept my eyes from watering except for these glasses .
These are great sturdy straws.  I don't notice a metallic taste when using them. They're not the best for smoothies, but perfect for drinks.  I'd definitely purchase cleaning brushes as well .
I purchased these to clean my stainless steel drinking straws.  The smallest fits tightly enough to wash the regular drinking straws and the widest ones fit well enough to clean my wide plastic smoothie straws.  They don't feel super sturdy as the metal bends some, but my stainless steel drinking straws are bent and it aids in cleaning around the curve.  I figure they'll last at least a year if not longer if I'm careful and are definitely worth the purchase .
Since these rugs are reversible, there is no sticky backing and are slippery on the bathroom floor.  They're well constructed, but are very thick.  I don't know that they are going to dry out after use .
If you want some fun then download this game. It has no age limit this game is good for everybody i really enjoy this game .
Really GOOD, but not so easy handle with a single hand .
I never write reviews but this one deserves it. After spending actually wasting money on primers I finally found one that works!! It keeps my makeup on all day and doesn't irritate my skin or cause breakouts. I use it before and after makeup and still use a setting powder after. Very happy with this, will definitelybe using this forever .
love this! suits my needs perfectly...holds all my cards and then some. Thumbs up! no more Costanza wallet for me .
I had one of these for 15 years and it stopped winding properly.  The new one is perfect for my old microwave which does not have a turntable in it.  The shipment came very quickly, so that was a bonus .
I HAVE WORN THESE SHOES FOR ABOUT 5 YEARS NOW AND WOULD NOT WEAR ANYTHING ELSE, I EVEN HAVE MY HUSBAND WAERING THEM, WORK GREAT FOR  FACTORY WORK ON YOUR FEET ALL THE TIME .
This product was a really good deal for the quality (super sharp clean cut with a large and small hole). I've always had problems with sharpeners but this one hasn't failed me yet .
I've heard that OtterBox cases are really nice and getting this commuter series proved it to me. This case doesn't give too much bulk which I was worried about. It took a few days more than expected to arrive with free supersaver shipping but it was worth the wait. I would recommend this to people prone to dropping their phones, or anyone who wants the security of a really good phone case .
Gorgeous color, however runs big in areas and super tight in the arm area. I'm 5'4 and 130 lbs but the arms on my elbow were beyond tight. Cute but wish I didn't get it due to the fit .
What a bad design. With wet hands and a moving toddler there is no easy way to use this as you have to try and grip the side or bottom. They should have included a handle. Plus, the rubber that is supposed to form around the child's head when you poor is too stiff and water just gets in their eyes anyways. Lastly. when trying to use the sprinkler function unless you poor really slowly the water just runs over the lip. Not much good to say about what should be such a simple product .
Can I just say, there's nothing like a hot Brisitsh boy? Oh man, the feels in this book. Such an awesome read .
I was dying to get the Kindle Fire, had it a short while, then it wouldn't charge. Disappointing I know; So I contacted Amazon, and they said they'd replace it.. however I had to wait a month to get my replacement.. That sucked literally... but I was happy that they were replacing it so I eagerly and not so happily waited for it to arrive which was  around the 1st of January. Then it arrived I was yet again paired with my travel companion! Well 4 months later it won't charge... again So I contact Amazon and they say they'll replace it even though my warranty is inches from expiring. Today I get my 3rd kindle and it has hyper pixels of bright white light shining through the images. So I contacted amazon once again and now are sending me a 4th Kindle !! 4 KINDLES IN 1 YEAR. That's just ridiculous! The only thing amazon can say is sorry nothing else; that they will forward my complaints to their specialized customer service and go from there... I think that means we'll just throw it in a folder with everyone else's complaints; because we are still making money here.  Its really disappointing, that I am on number 4. I am sure Amazons' CEO doesn't care, because they still have good sales. So who cares! Shame on Amazon.... All of my friends have kindles, and they all have had to have them replaced at least once, some of them twice, and the feedback forums are full of unsatisfied customers, Amazons not making it as right as they could be .
While the book is compellingly entertaining from the start to the finish. It never really hits home on the issues it raises at the beginning. A disillusioned corporate sellout taking on the powers behind the world's biggest conspiracies should deliver so much more than this short piece did.Nonetheless, if youre after a strange, hilariously entertaining and at points depraved quickie, Eggman is your man .
Throw all my favorite Disney movies in a mixer, add the talents of a great writer and some dystopian dust (you know, like fairy dust. Haha.), mix it up and voila! I got myself a brand favorite book of the year that makes my inner child come to life again (aka run around screaming with her arms in the air in a pink princess dress and a fake crown on her head). Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you: THE SELECTION!"I hope you find someone you can't live without.I really do. And I hope you never have to know what it's like to have to try and live without them."I think it's obvious already that I loved this book. In case it wasn't, well, I did. I do. I love the story and the characters and everything about it! America is such a great main character, someone I could relate to in many ways. If I were to live in her world, I would be like her. A five. Only three steps up from nothing. But while she doesn't want to be a princess, I have always dreamed of it since I saw my first disney film so many years ago. I loved her and she would make a great Disney princess! (This book would be awesome as an animated Disney film, too.)Now I shall talk about the first fictional character ever I fell in love with. (Seriously I shed a tear because I knew he wasn't real. Sigh.) Of course I'm talking about Maxon. He's so... Maxon. Sigh again. Maxon.Okay moving on. Aspen. I loved him at first. So romantic and loving and caring and then... a complete stupid douchebag. I hate him.Speaking of hating someone... I hated Celeste. She's so mean and stuck up and bleh. But I loved Marlee and May and all the other characters!As I said, I loved this story. We got to know America while the story builds in the beginning until the inevitable moment she gets chosen for The Selection. She stays true to who she is and never forgot where she came from, another thing I loved about her by the way. She's different from the other girls in many ways and refuses to change for anyone. I loved how the relationship between her and Maxon grew along with the story and I fell for Maxon along with America. And when they kissed my inner child was so happy she fainted. Yes, that happens.But not everything is rainbows and sunshine in the palace. There are these rebels, what their purpose is we have yet to find out, who form a threat to the royal family and I liked that. That's what gives it an extra dystopian touch. But life goes on in the palace and I loved every part of it! Until that douchebag Aspen came back into the story and messed things up again. I hope for him that he doesn't mess things up in the next book or else... Well not much he is a fictional character so I can't do much... But if he were real, I would kick is ass. For sure.So in the end, this book is everything I hoped it would be and more. I can't wait to start the sequel (luckily I don't have to since I just got a copy from Netgalley, yay!). Great job Kiera! I LOVE YOU .
Well... I regret reading this book now. Because now I probably have to wait way to long for the sequel! That's just mean! I want it! I want it now!*Ahem* I guess you could say that I liked this book. No actually I didn't like it. I loved it! It was everything I hoped it to be and more! So So So SOOOOO AWESOME!The story starts almost right after the first book and the characters I fell in love with (some more than I should) or grew to hate so much (*cough*Celeste*cough*) are still here and I'm sooo happy! In this book we learn more about the history of the land through Diaries from Gregory Illea and we see a bit of a darker side of it. We get to know the King and Queen more in this book, which was awesome. I love Queen Amberly, she's so nice! But I hate the King. I really do. Almost as much as I hate Celeste, that *peeeeep*. Bleh.America is still awesome, even though maybe a little more emotional in this one. I get that I was too. I was so torn and I am just reading the book. If I were America, I would be crying all the time. But she is still true to herself and never forgets were she comes from and she isn't afraid to fight for what she thinks is right. And I'm glad she has support from some people in the palace. Now why is she so torn? Guys of course...Maxon... Sigh. My emotions were scrambled up good in this book, and that's mainly because of him. First I still love him, than I don't like him so much, than I do, than I hate him, and in the end I loved him again. Yeesh... I mean... I get that he needs to find a wife, but if he really loves America, like he says, why kissing those other girls? Okay yeah, sometimes America is to blaim for that one to because she pushes him away constantly (something I don't understand by the way... I would never push him away), but come on Maxon... Kissing Celeste? Seriously? If I could I would kick you right in your royal parts. But I can't stay mad at him for long, so...And then there's Aspen. Yeah he's a douchebag but at least he is a one-woman kind of guy and he fights for America. Something I admire. And it's romantic... So you see why America is so torn? I certainly am... But I still think I'm team Maxon.Oh and I love her dad! He made me cry quite a bit in this book with those letters he wrote to America. Wish I had a dad like that.And Marlee... I'm soooo not going to talk about her. I'll cry again.So yeah, this was awesome. I loved it. I want the sequel .
Oh my god. That's about the only thing I can come up with now. Oh my god. This book was so... Brilliant, original, heartbreaking, sad, happy and full of love and friendship. I may have a new favorite for this year!This book is about Addie. She lives in a Compound, a place where people with abilities live. It's top secret and the Norms, normal people, don't know about it. Addie can see where certain paths take her in the future when she has to make a choice. When her parents tell her they will be getting a divorce, she has to choose to stay with her mom or her dad, who is leaving the compound to live in Norm world. In one future she is pursued by the hottest guy in school, Duke, but she never wanted to be a quarterback's girlfriend. In the other one she's adjusting to live outside the Compound with her dad. She meets Trevor, a cute, sensitive and sweet artist and he understands her. But when her father is asked to consult in a murder in the Compound, she's drawn into a dangerous game that threatens everything and everyone she loves. Love and loss in both lives, but she has to choose which one she wants to live through and who she can't live without.This was such an amazing story. The writing is so great and the world where Addie lives in is so original. I loved how the author chose to indicate which future it was at the beginning of each chapter. This story was build so great and both futures blended together in so many ways, especially near the end and I know she must have worked on this a long time and thought it through about a hundred times. So amazing! The romance in this book was beautiful. I believed it and there was no insta-love or anything like that View Spoiler I loved the characters too. Addie is so cool. I wish I had her power sometimes. And I feel for her too, but I know she makes the right choice in the end. Laila is such a vibrant and funny character! And Trevor may be my new book-boyfriend. All of them were great, even the bad ones, who I still hate. Well developed and surprisingly realistic for people who have abilities (well, not all of them of course). Awesome.I highly recommend this book to everyone. It's a must-read for sure. And I'm so glad I have the hardcover because I will re-read it many times in the future and I love the cover too. Just awesome. And Brilliant. And breathtaking. Read it. NOW .
4.5 starsKasie West has done it again. She just blew me away. Although in a way, I think I expected it. Pivot Point was so great that this one just had to be great too. It's awesome and made me feel all fluffy and light. Seriously brilliant. The characters, the writing, the story... Amazing!The Distance Between Us is about Caymen and Xander. Caymen is an only child and lives with her mom above their doll store. They don't have an easy life and it's hard to get around with the little money they have. Now Xander, he's the opposite. He's pretty rich and handsome at that. But you know what they say... Opposites attract! But will it last?God, what can I say about this book that hasn't already been said in other reviews. This book was so great. I loved all of it. I knew the writing would be really good. I mean, it was great in Pivot Point, so. And I expected the story to be good too. And it is. It's sweet, romantic, breathtaking and full of cute moments. Those dates Caymen and Xander went on were so weird and original! Well, they didn't call it dates, but that's what they were. And I loved that. And it wasn't insta-love. Their relationship grew and when to romance finally came, it was sooooo amazing. And they don't tell each other `I love you' immediately, which also is a great thing because I don't like that very much and it's not realistic. But this book was!Of course I loved the characters. Even the minor ones. I mean, Skye and Henry were awesome and so funny! And Mason... Yeah he was okay, but I didn't really like him that much. I didn't know whether I liked Caymens mom or not. Sometimes she was pretty annoying, but in the end I got why she acted the way she did. And I liked Xander's family!I loved Caymen. I really did. Her humour was just... hilarious. Probably because mine is also dry and sarcastic, so I got all of her jokes and I laughed out loud a lot so. She's *exceptionally* good at it. And she was very relatable, which made the character more real! But there was one thing that really bugged me. Her attitude towards rich people. Actually, that bothered me with her mom too. They made it such a big deal and the stereotypes were just stupid. So he's rich, so what? But hey, that's the only thing in the entire book, so. And Xander is awesome. He's so perfect for Caymen and I really loved him. He was funny too! Their conversations made me laugh and giggle out loud. (Not fun when I was reading on the bus and people stared at me...) Guess first impressions aren't always right, which is kind of the message in this book I think.Amazing book with a breathtaking, sweet and cute romance. But not just love, also friendship and a very good message about how first impressions can be very wrong. Kasie West, I won't think twice about buying one of your books ever again. I'm just going to do it. So is my copy of Split Second on its way already or .
This review contains a few spoilers for the first two books in the series, Cinder and Scarlet. If you have not read them yet&#8230; I suggest you do that now, because you&#8217;re missing out. There also may be a few minor ones for Cress.Oh my stars, this was awesome. This is by far the best book of the series so far, for me personally. I loved it so much! I read it the minute I got it in my mail and I finished it that same day. Could not put it down. Cress is a action-packed, brilliantly written, amazing, wild roller coaster ride. And as soon as all of it has processed in my mind and I have written this review, I will go and cry because I will have to wait for a whole year for Winter.Cress is the third book in the Lunar Chronicles. In it we first meet Cress. She is a very talented hacker and has lived in a satellite for years as a prisoner, working for the Lunar Queen. But she has other plans and calls for help from our beloved gang. Cinder, Thorne, Wolf and Scarlet go to her rescue, but stuff happens and they get separated from each other. Cress and Thorne are catapulted down to Earth in the satellite, Scarlet is taken by Cress&#8217;s mistress, Sibyl to Luna and Cinder and Wolf manage to escape in their ship to Africa where they meet with Dr. Erland. The clock is ticking and they have to find each other again and make a plan to stop Queen Levana.Yes, it is as awesome as it sounds. My heart was racing the entire time and I just had to keep on reading. While the other two books were a bit predictable, Cinder more than Scarlet, this one was not. Which had me sitting on the edge of my seat for all of the 550 pages. I think that&#8217;s why I loved this one the most so far. The writing is still incredible and really, I bow to you Marissa. I really do. There is not much of a recap, so if it has been a year since you&#8217;ve read the other books&#8230; shame on you! You could&#8217;ve done a marathon and then crawl to a corner and cry like the rest of us because of the long wait for Winter. Seriously though&#8230; A year? I don&#8217;t compute.So stuff happens when they rescue Cress and they are separated. Scarlet is taken to Luna as a prisoner and even though she didn&#8217;t have a lot of story in this book, it&#8217;s still really intense. Especially towards the end. My god, Marissa, you are merciless! Which brings me to Thorne and Cress. When they crash to Earth (of course they don&#8217;t die, the book would be over if they did, so it&#8217;s not a spoiler), something happens to Thorne which makes him blind. At first I was raging mad at Marissa for doing that, because well&#8230; we all love Thorne. But he still is the same arrogant handsome jerk we all hate because we love him, so it&#8217;s all good. They are stranded in the desert and I loved how they bonded. And Cress&#8217;s first moments on Earth were actually pretty funny, because it reminded me of Rapunzel in the Disney movie Tangled when she first came out of her tower. (Yes, the song would fit perfectly for that moment in the book too.) Overall, Cress was pretty similar to Rapunzel from Tangled, which I loved because I love that movie. You know, she&#8217;s a bit awkward around other people because she&#8217;s been alone for all those years except for a few visits from her mistress. She&#8217;s funny and yes I can picture her defending herself with a frying pan. But she&#8217;s also an amazing hacker and a really great character and I loved her.Then we come to Cinder and Wolf. Wolf also doesn&#8217;t have much of a story because he&#8217;s knocked out for one part of the book and practically a zombie the other part. He worries about Scarlet, which does give him some character development. Cinder has a lot of pressure on her shoulders and in this book, she&#8217;s really scared and worried. What if she can&#8217;t save the world? What if her plan goes horribly wrong? And I loved that too because it means that she&#8217;s no Mary Sue and it makes her more human too. But of course, she&#8217;s still a bad ass cyborg Lunar princess so she kicks ass when she has too.That leaves us with the other minor characters. There&#8217;s a new one (sort off), Jacin Clay. He&#8217;s a Lunar Guard who actually helped Cinder and Wolf escape from the satellite. He&#8217;s mentioned in the first book too if I remember correctly. Then we have Dr. Erland, also from book one. He&#8217;s in Africa, where Cinder meets up with him and he also has a storyline, which I&#8217;m not going to talk about because that&#8217;s a spoiler. So I&#8217;ll move on to Kai, who I love again! In Scarlet, I had a love-hate relationship with him, but not anymore. He&#8217;s a prince and he&#8217;s hot and he actually does things right in this book. Well, for the most part anyway. That leaves us with&#8230;. Levana. Yeah, still hate her. I&#8217;m not going to talk about all the other side characters, but I do want to mention one of them because she has a pretty big role in the fourth book! Yes, Winter makes an appearance towards the end. I won&#8217;t spoil anything about it, all I&#8217;ll say is that she&#8217;s not what I thought she would be, in a very good way. And it makes me even more excited to read the next book.Stars, it seems I have a lot to say about these books. They are just so brilliant and I love them so much and I try to avoid thinking about how long the wait is for Winter. But time goes by very quick for me these days, so 2015 will be here before I realize. At least, that&#8217;s what I hope. Of course I recommend this book! Fans of the series so far won&#8217;t be disappointed and if you are&#8230; I think you read another book. So if you haven&#8217;t had the chance to start this one yet, brace yourself because you&#8217;re in for a wild ride .
*ARC provided by Harlequin Teen via NetGalley. Thank you so much!*4.5 stars!Well, I think it's obvious... The first and most important question: WHY HAVEN'T I READ ANYTHING BY JULIE KAGAWA YET??? I really don't know. Geesh, this woman is awesome! I love her writing. She creates an amazing world in this novel and I actually get details on the worldbuilding, which is awesome. She fascinates me from the start and she got the vampires really good in this one. Okay the story seemed a mix of I am Legend, True Blood and a sniff of Hunger Games, but that's not bad, is it? No! It's more awesome!But seriously... A world were books are illegal? Just hang me already. I wouldn't last a day there. No books? No no no no no no. That's not how I roll. I need ma books okay? But I loved every part of this book. Part 1 was good, part 2 was better and part 3 was awesome. So yeah. You get it. It got better and better every chapter.Okay, the characters. I love Allie. I love her as a human and as a vampire. She's a kick-ass heroine all right. She's stubborn and she can really kick some ass if she needs to, but she's also caring and loving and she doesn't want to hurt anybody, even as a vampire.I liked Lucas and Stick, and I loved Kanin, even when I didn't knew his name yet. OH and I loved Zeke and his group. Yeah. Zeke. *sigh*This book is a lot of awesome and I'm going to read the sequel soon. This review will also be on my blog .
Sequels are always hard to write. People usually have high expectations if the first book was really awesome (which is was in this case) and it's difficult to live up to those expectations of all of your fans. But Julie Kagawa did exactly that, because this book is AWESOME!Yeah I use that word a lot, but it's true! Allison still is badass, but she annoyed me a bit in the beginning. I get it, she misses Zeke and to be honest, I would too, but come on... Just kick some ass and maybe you'll get to see him again! She struggles to keep her humanity and control her vampire side and doesn't always succeed in that. So I still love her!It was cool to get to know the other characters better too and see some old ones from the first book return! I did miss some of themJulie's writing still is beyond brilliant. I love how she describes the world she has created and in this novel we get more details of that world, which is great because it helps me to get more into the story! She keeps me on the edge of my very comfy couch and really hooks me to the story in a way not many authors can. And she can make me swoon with some scenes. I seriously was reading with a big smile on my face at times. She can take my breath away and crush my heart at the same time. (Thanks for that...)Of course she left me hanging at the end, which I kind of expected from her, but it sucks nonetheless...I give this book 4 stars because the slow beginning and Allison's references to Zeke in the first few chapters were a bit annoying but it's a great book and those who love the first one, will love this one just as much .
Oh my god... This book was incredible. A truly compelling story with fascinating creatures, realistic characters and a mind-blowing romance. And really the only thing that I didn't like was the big info dumps you get sometimes but I'm willing to look past that just for Ink. Sigh. My Ink.Normally this is the part where I give a short summary of the story but with this book I can't do that without telling you the whole thing and make it one giant spoiler. So I'm going to skip that part just to talk about the book itself. First off all, great writing. Dawn managed to suck me in right from the first page and she didn't let me go until the book was finished. Even now, an hour after finishing it, I'm still in the story with my head. It was so fascinating and wonderful. I love this book. But like I said, I got some big info dumps and while it was all very interesting and I wanted to know more the first time, but after a few of those dumps, I was kinda like... "Hmm. Okay. So when am I going to get more of Ink and Joy?"Ink and Joy. God, I love those two. They were so compelling and realistic and just awesome. Their relationship was a bit bumpy at the beginning, no wonder if you see how it started. Joy gets sucked into his world without even realizing what is going on just because of a mistake Ink made. And nobody else can see him so that makes it all the more complicated. But you feel the tension between them and after a while, I felt tense too every time there was a scene were they were so close to the romance-part. I waited long for the real romancy stuff to kick in and when it did... I felt like I was melting inside with the tension and everything. I constantly felt like I was about to faint when Ink and Joy were together. I felt lightheaded and compelled and it took my breath away every single time.I loved Joy. She handled all this in a way that I can relate too. And she has some serious family stuff to deal with next to all that mysterious stuff. She was nice to read about and she's a fun main-character. And Ink. God... He was so compelling and I had a strange connection with him. Weird to say, but I did. He was such an amazing character and it was so interesting to see him learning to feel like a human and I felt for him. It wasn't hard to like him. Same with his sister, Inq and Joy's friend Monica. And her dad. He's such a great dad.And then the end. The last 40 something pages. Ooooh my god I was on the edge of my seat screaming and getting heart attacks and asthma and everything. And again, Ink and Joy... Swoon, Sigh, Faint, Die. I still feel tense.Now this is a book where I wouldn't have minded if there was insta-love. I would've understood it 100% just because of Ink. But I loved the tension and everything. I loved the feels I got from this book. So I recommend it to everyone. This is an amazing book. It really is .
This was such a nice surprise! I went into One Man Guy with mixed expectations and I just ended up loving it to bits. It's such a surprisingly light and fun summer read. In one word: adorable.One Man Guy tells the story of Alek. Alek's family is Armenian and very much grounded in their own traditions. Alek doesn't always feel like he belongs though. When his parents force him to go to Summer School, his whole summer seems to be ruined. But then the cool and handsome Ethan notices him and Alek's summer just got a whole lot better. Ethan seems to want more than just be friends, but what does Alek want?Wow, talk about diversity! This book is not only about a young man/boy discovering he's gay. It's also about that boy's Armenian heritage. I was surprised by how much I loved that aspect of the book! I was a bit hesitant about it going into the book, but Michael won me over immediately! The stuff we learn about the Armenian people was really interesting and yes, I did get a bit hungry from all that talk about the foods they have. Makes me want to try Armenian food.While this may not be the best writing ever, it's still very good. I was sucked into the story right from the start and it didn't let me go! Alek was such a great main character and I liked him a lot! I think a lot of people can relate to him. He's stuck between being who his parents want him to be and being who he really is. I really did feel for him and with him. I was just as annoyed by his parents as he was and I loved that! His parents were a bit annoying at first. They really stick to their traditions and beliefs and while I respect that, it did annoy me a bit. They grew up in America themselves so they can expect their kids to be a bit more modern than they are too! But they grew a lot in this book and I really liked that! Alek's brother Nik, who seems like the perfect son, also grows! The character development in this book is fantastic! Everyone grew in this book. They all learned from their mistakes.I loved Becky, Alek's best friend. She was fun, quirky, a bit of a nerd, ... She's such a great friend to Alek and I loved their friendship. It felt so real and genuine. And then you have Ethan. I loved him so much. He's confident and free spirited. Almost the opposite of Alek. He has a really good influence on Alek, learning him that it's not wrong to want something and be yourself. Their romance was absolutely perfect. It built up slow in the first half and the second half was just one swoon-worthy moment after another. So sweet and adorable!One Man Guy is a very fun, sweet, adorable summer read that I'd recommend to everyone who loves a good contemporary romance book with a little more diversity in it. I loved it and I can't wait to see what the author brings us next! And yes, Kat, I did want to hug everyone in this book by the end .
So a guy who hunts and kills murderous ghosts with an athame and travels from city to city with is witchy mom and scary cat. Yeah, this guy reminded me of someone I know from TV... Dean Winchester?Exactly. But I didn't mind. Not at all. Because I really loved this book. I really really did. It was way better then I expected. I haven't read much horror stories before. Thrillers, detectives, ... Books like that I've read. But never something like this. This book was scary, sweet, heartbreaking, gross and scary again. It made me sit at the edge of my seat clinging to my eReader. It hooked me and I couldn't shake it off. I was thinking about it when I was trying to sleep. I'll have to start reading another book and even then I'll still be thinking about it. That's how good this was. (And scary. And gross.)Come on, be honest. That's enough to make a person curious about the book and that's just one sentence! This book starts of with a bang. A scary and gross bang, but still a bang. It had my attention immediately. It builds up and even breaks your heart sometimes. It definitely isn't a story for the faint hearted. So if you're easily scared and don't like gross details, don't read this book because it has a lot of gross and scary parts. Seriously. Gross, scary, what-was-the-author-thinking parts. And the ending... Geesh... The ending. It broke my heart again.Now the characters. Like I said, Cas really reminded me of one Dean Winchester, but that is not a bad thing. Cas is badass, sweet, caring, funny and he isn't perfect not at all. He is insecure and scared sometimes. Of course he is. And I really love him for that. And I love his mom. She's not just another random character. She really brings something to the story and she is so cool! Oh and I have to say that I love Thomas and Carmel too. They are the first real friends Cas gets in his life and I really like them. They too, mean something in this story. I love this book for that. No characters just to fill up gaps. Every character means something!And yes, I'm going to talk about her to. Anna. Anna dressed in blood. I'm not going to give away anything about her story, you'll have to read the book for that. But it broke my heart. I love Anna and I feel sorry for what happened to her, even tough I had nothing to do with it and it didn't even really happen.So if you love these kinds of books, you'll certainly love this one. If you're still not sure wether or not to read it, I'd give it a try if I were you. It's worth it. It really is .
Short review for a pretty short book.Even though the idea of this book was something that I quite liked, the book itself didn't do it for me. The writing wasn't great, not good enough to suck me into the story. And the main character was a bit annoying. I'm sorry, but this book is not as good as I hoped it to be. Allison acted way to hard-to-get with Ethan, which was the main thing that annoyed me about her and I just didn't get any feels in this book. (That's a must for me. I need the feels.)The concept of the Danaans, the fairies from Ireland, was interesting and for that I give the book credit because it's the only thing that made the book good. But for the rest, it just wasn't for me. Sorry .
Damnit Sarah, now you've made me cry all sorts of tears. Guess you're on my list of Authors who made me cry now. And you're the second person who wrote a book I dreamed about after reading it.This is the story of 20-year old Charlie. After her brother died, she goes to his home in San Diego, far away from her home in Tennessee. There she meets Jhett. A friend of her brother. And then Charlie's life changes and her parents are not to fond of that.I loved this story. A lot. I liked Charlie. In a way she reminded me of myself. (Except for the fact that I don't have rich parents.) She's pretty shy and has always lived the life her parents wanted her to live. Her brother never wanted that so he moved to San Diego and he wanted her to move there to, but she never took that step. Until she meets Jhett. More on him later. I loved seeing Charlie grow as a person. She can be pretty stubborn and I loved hearing that Tennessee accent in my head when she was angry.Jhett. Oh my god.... He's yummy. I love him. He's awesome. I want him.The writing is very good, which I had hoped because I didn't want to hate this story. Sarah is a friend of mine and I'm so glad that she did so well! Yeesh, she even made me cry. Really cry! That's hard to accomplish with me (over a book, that is... series or films, no problem.), so you can say that she is a real new upcoming talent! I felt everything Charlie and Jhett felt and I loved them so much. I loved the fact that there is actual character development in this book! They both grow because of each other. Awesome. But I hate Charlie's mom. God, she's an awful woman.So yeah, I loved this book. I'm a beta reader for it, so maybe things will change in the editing process, but it's awesome nonetheless. Read it. It comes out next month and you can win a copy in the big giveaway I'm having at the end of June! (Or sooner .
3.5 starsThis book was better than I expected. Yeah, the fact that it's about elemental powers has something to do with it and the fact that the main character has the power of my favorite element, fire, has a lot to do with it, but it was just a good book overall.Yeah, I think this review will be a bit short, but I don't have a lot to say about it, so. And it's not a bad thing! The story was good, the writing was good, the romance was good. It was just a good solid book! And yeah, pretty original too. And I'm happy the author gave me a chance to read it. I loved the world she build in this book and how she handled the paranormal stuff in it. Yeah, elemental powers are a weakness of mine, so it was hard to not like this book. But if it wasn't that good, I would've been honest about it. Not everyone can get it right, but Jessie did.I liked the characters, they were pretty well-developed and I liked most of them. Kiarra is cool, with the power of fire and all that. Wish I was her. Or rather, wish I had her power. Jaxton was.... yum first of all. He was cool and I loved getting to know him. And I loved Neena too. Again, all of the characters were great. And I can't wait to see what happens next, what their new adventure is.The book is the start of a new series and I'm pretty excited about it. I want to know what happens next! So yeah, I liked the book and I'm going to read the next books in the series .
I just have to say it again. This cover is beyond awesome. Seriously.Now, the book. Well, it's awesome too. It really really is. I loved everything about it. The story, the characters, ... It's original and fun and exciting and romantic and so much more. I suggest you read it as soon as you can because it absolutely belongs to my best-books-ever list. I love love LOVE it. Can't say it enough. I can't wait for the second book in this series!Thank you D.T. for giving me an ARC copy of this brilliant book. You better not let me wait to long for the second.Short review, but what else do I have to say? If you want to know more about the book, then read it .
Well, I finished, but only because I got this book for review from Netgalley. That's the only reason. This will be one of those review I hate to write, but sometimes you just have to.So... yeah... This book was not that good. Not what I expected at all. Basically this book is about Maddie. She is new at college and in the beginning of the book we meet her when she is getting her annual tattoo. She does that too numb the pain of her parents murder seven years ago. Sounds like a cool character, doesn't it? Well, it isn't. She sounds like a cool chick with issues, but actually she's a naive (or dumb) 18-year old girl who never watches tv, never had a cell phone before and don't know what 'kinky' means. Yeesh. Talk about unrelatable. That wouldn't bother me if I had seen more of the traumatised, broken side of her that witnessed her parents murder. But I rarely saw that. 80% of the time she is just a normal (stupid, dumb and naive) girl. Yeah... No.Then we have Kyle. His dad is the one who killed Maddies parents al those years ago. I didn't like him either. Just another stereotype boy that has some issues he never deals with and instead only thinks of sex. *Yaaaawn*The rest of the characters were not all that memorable for me, so that's not good either.The romance in this story is one of the main things. Maddie has been in love with Kyle for years because they used to be best friends when they were young. I hoped for a good romance here, but it was just kissing and no bonding most of the time. Yeah, that doesn't do it for me. Especially when I got the background on how they used to be. They made some kind of pact when they were eleven to be each others firsts. First kiss, first date, etc,... And when they see each other again after so many years, no bonding and catching up at all? Another let down in this book. Sigh. Oh and I for one, could never fall in love with a guy whose father killed my parents. Maybe I'm just weird for that. *shrugs*The writing.... Well... I've read much better. Really. The double POV didn't work for me. At all.If you expect a great, uplifting book about hope, forgiveness, love, drama, etc,... Don't hold your breath, because that's not what this book was for me personally. I am really sorry, but I just didn't like this book at all. It's a shame though... I like the cover and the blurb made it sound so interesting... *sigh* I'm sorry for the negative review. I really don't like doing this .
Ooooh how I've missed these characters! Faith, Harmony, Krista, Carson, Maryah, Nathan,... I've been waiting for so long to know how your story would go on! And know I know, and I want to know what happens next!The writing was as good as it was in the first book, maybe even better. Karen Hooper is one of those really talented writers who can hook me to a book and let me stay up late because I just can't stop reading. I really love her and I love this series. It's so awesome! In this book we get to know a little more and we get to know new characters. There's action, romance, friendship, drama,... It's all there. And I still want to know more. Why did Maryah erase? That's the main question. Some of the questions are answered in this book, but most of aren't, which is good, because it makes me, as a reader, curious for more.What's also awesome, is that you can choose in this book! You want a cliffhanger? Or rather not? You can choose in this book! (Just read it and you'll understand.) I do recommend reading the first book before this one, because it starts right where the last one left off and you won't understand a thing in this book. There's no recap here. (So more time for the story to get on! Yay!) But since these books are awesome, it won't be time wasted.I know this review is not very long, but I can't say much else without spoiling the whole thing. So I'll leave it at this, but I do have one more question that has been burning in my mind since I read the first book... Where can I get my own Nathan .
Okay, up until the last chapter, this book was pretty standard with a little twist in it. A girl on the run from something or someone, meets a hot, very rich guy on the plane that is instantly obsessed with the girl, but has his own issues and past. And then the last chapter threw a one big twist in my face that leaves me with one giant questionmark.Escaping Reality is about Amy Bensen. Amy has gone through something in her past and now she's running for it. New name, new home, new life. And while running again after six years of peace, she meets Liam Stone on the plane. He's a very handsome, very rich and very talented architect. And he's instantly obsessed with Amy. They start a passionate affair, but Amy keeps doubting if she can trust him at all.Like I said before, this book is pretty Fifty Shades-like in the beginning. Except for the big mystery behind Amy herself, which I'm still figuring out after finishing the book. The writing was okay, the story was... yeah standard. The only thing that makes it a bit different from all the other books in the genre is the mystery behind Amy. Which, luckily, is enough to keep my interest up, but after a while, that stops. Nothing really happened until the very end and that wasn't enough in my opinion. Yeah sure, it gives me some questions, and I do want to know the answers, but still...The characters were.... Okay? Liam is very Christian-like and basically, I'm getting sick of that type. Rich, hot, issues from the past, obessed with the main girl for some reason,... Honestly, if I were in those situations as those girls in the books are when they meet the rich, hot guy, I'd run away from them. I don't need some obsessed guy who wants to own me. So no, I didn't really like him. As for Amy... Well she was somewhat the same as the girls in the other books. They throw back feminism by hundreds of years and I don't like that for one bit.So basically it's pretty standard and despite that, I do want to read the sequel because I need answers to those questions. I recommend this book to people who love Fifty Shades of Grey and other books like that .
So... good vampires, bad vampires, soulmates, witches,... Haven't heard that before... I expected it to be bad, honestly. It didn't seem all that original with the vampire-loves-human-thing, but I am so glad that this book wasn't what I expected for once. Because this was a really good book. Wait... What am I saying? It's not good. Not at all. IT'S AWESOME!Yeah you saw that right. This is an awesome book. And you know what? It actually turned out to be pretty damn original. I love the vampires in this book and the whole soulmate-thing. Throw in a witch and your settled for a good time reading this book. The writing is also great. I mean, seriously. Ashley has a way with words and when I read this book she kept me guessing until the end. I loved the mysteries and unanswered questions that hooked me to the story. Good job Ashley!I love Amelia. She's awesome. Yeah, she had a hard life and she had a lot to deal with but she's also a stubborn, strong young woman and she doesn't like to be controlled. (Unlike some other characters in vampire-books... *cough*) She fights the bond even though it may hurt her and I like that about her. And in the end, she learns why her life was as s***ty as it was. So yeah, great main character: CHECK!Of course I loved Mitchel and Angelle and Eric and Luke and... All of them. The good guys were great and the bad guys were great. It's all great. Awesome awesome fantastic!I will read the next books in the series as soon as I've finished the other R2R-books, ARC's,... that are screaming at me from my TBR-mountain. (Yes mountain. Not a list, not a pile, a mountain.) "Shut up! I'll read you as soon as I can, okay? Yeesh..." Books these days .
I got through this book pretty quick and it was pretty good. It has the right amount of action mixed with romance. But something didn't really wow me. The writing was also good, so that's not the issue. I didn't really connect with the characters and I don't know why because I actually liked them. Hmm... I'm so torn! I wanted to like this book so much because it seemed so great and it is pretty good, but I guess something just didn't connect me to the novel. Weird. Maybe this isn't really my type of book.If you love this genre, I really recommend it! It's a great book and fans of the genre will love it. I'm just not a big fan of action and stuff. :P Anyways, since this isn't a bad novel it deserves 3 stars .
I... I just... Okay I can't do this right now... I need a minute okay?30 minutes later...Yeah, 1 minute, 30 minutes... whatever. If you've read this book, you understand. If you haven't, you will when you have. This book is so... my god I still can't find the right words.Another 15 minutes later...Okay I'm ready now. This book was heartbreaking and so beautiful. It's one of the best I've read this year. While I was reading, I was laughing, crying and speechless. It was both sad and uplifting. It's a story about coping with loss, grief, regret, making mistakes and trying to fix them. But it's also a story about friendship, forgiveness and love. Brilliant, just... brilliant.I didn't understand that at first, but I did once I finished the book. I get it know. So does Kacey. Kacey is the main character in this story. Four years ago she was in a terrible accident in which she lost so much. Since then, she has never been the same. But she still has her sister Livie. They move to Miami to escape their aunt and uncle and to start over. That's not easy, of course. They meet their neighbors, Storm and her daughter Mia. Storm helps Kacey get a job as her co-worker. A bartender in a strip-club. And they meet Trent. The hot guy from appartement 1D. But Kacey still has to deal with her past and she doesn't let anybody come to close to her. Somehow Trent finds a way to crawl under her skin, but he too has some skeletons in his closet. I can't talk about that because it's a huge spoiler and you have to read the book and feel everything without knowing what'll happen. So no more about that. The writing was excellent. Absolutely without a doubt. This woman has a lot of talent. Can't wait to start the sequel.I loved Kacey. She was so awesome, seriously. Yeah, she has some major issues to deal with, but that's understandable, isn't it? She went through a lot and honestly, I don't blame her for coping with it the way she did. I wouldn't even have survived it. She really is tough. Oh, I love her sarcasm and the fact that she can kick some ass, literally.I also loved Livie, although we didn't get to know her that well. Still, she's cool for a fifteen-year-old. Oh and Storm. Who would've thought that a blond barbie with huge tits who works in a strip club could be so awesome? But she is, she really is. She's caring and nice and so sweet. She's a great friend and an even greater mom. I really love her.Now we talk about the guy. The hot guy from appartement 1D. He wasn't what I expected. At all. At first, I thought he'd be one of those hot guys that fixes the troubled girl with sex. But he's not that guy. He's a sweet, caring and loving man and a gentleman. I never would've guessed that. But... no I can't talk about that because it's a big fat spoiler, so I'm not going to say anything. But in the end, my opinion about him is still the same.Basically I loved all the characters. Cain, the owner of the club where Storm and Kacey work, is so cool. He's not a stereotype! Hurray! I loved them all and I will remember them for a long time.By writing Ten Tiny Breaths K.A. Tucker crawled under MY skin and didn't let me go. I don't think I'll forget this book anytime soon .
Okay I know a lot of people have doubts about High School Romance books, but this was something else. It's set in the 80's AND the main guy is a hot Korean. That's cool, right? Okay, just the hot Korean guy then. This book... This book was EPIC.I really really really really loved this book. The writing was so good. Funny, clever, romantic, exciting,... I really felt what the characters felt and I loved with them, cried with them, laughed with them... I loved the fact what holding hands for the first time did to Eleanor and Park. They were so cute together and by the time I was halfway through the book, I was just waiting for them to kiss and when they did, I just melted and was trembling the whole time for the rest of the book. And then I cried and cried and cried... And then I was confused. Seriously. I have no clue how this book ends, the last chapter was just soooo confusing.I love how the relationship between Eleanor & Park grows. You can practically see them falling in love and you just can't not love them. You just have to love them. Just have to. I loved Park. For some reason when I first imagined how he would look, Zuko from Avatar The Last Airbender, came to my mind. Without scar that is. Don't know why. He just did. And Eleanor is so cool and different and not the stereotype perfect-looking skinny girl. I like a girl with a little meat on her bones. YEAH! Go Eleanor! You rock! Plus, red hair... Duh, that's just awesome. I love this. But still, confused about the end.So that's what I think of this. I want to thank TT for recommending this awesome book. Just another book for my best-books-ever shelf. For those who haven't read it yet, I highly recommend you do .
Wow. I just have no words. I've been sitting here for a few minutes, thinking about what I was going to say in my review. Still have nothing, so I'm just going to ramble a bit and sometimes these kinds of reviews are the most fun to read. But I did love this book. A lot. And it might just have a place in my top 14 of this year already.First of all, this is such an original story. I'm not going to give a summary because of what I just said. My thoughts are all jumbled up and I can't get them straight so. But the main character is pretty cool. The story is cool and the idea of The Archive is so original. I was sucked in from the first page and I just read it pretty much in one sitting (with some breaks here and there). There are two kinds of narrations, both Mackenzie. One is just the present and the other is I think the past. It's like her diary to her dead grandfather who learned her all about the Archive and all that stuff. It was pretty cool and it wasn't annoying, it really helped the story along. There is a bit of a romance, but it's secondary and I loved that. And it wasn't really a big romance. It was nice because there was a lot going on for Mackenzie and she has more important stuff to do.I really liked the characters in this book. They were all important to the story and I wanted to know more about them. I just... I was sucked into that world with those people and the mystery in it all. Mackenzie is a great main character. I loved her. And I felt for her. I also loved Wesley, he's cool and awesome. I'm not going to say to much about the other ones, but they were all great and I loved them all. There is something wrong in the Archive and it's someone in the inside that does bad things and I suspected someone the whole time but in the end I was wrong and I like that. It wasn't predictable. God I'm really jumping from one thing to another here.I'll sum it all up by just saying that it's really good, I'm going to buy the hardback copy of it next month because it's just that great (and duhh, cover love!) and I can't wait to read the sequel. I'd recommend this book to people who loved Anna Dressed in Blood or even the TV-show Supernatural (first season). It's really original and definitely a must-read for fans of the YA Paranormal genre. Schwab, you've got a new fan .
Wow... This book is heartbreaking, frustrating, dramatic, romantic and more. It was more then I expected, to be honest. Way more. And I loved every part of it.So in this book suicide is an epidemic. And the only 'cure' they could come up with is The Program. (Stupid donkeys... I may have a few ideas that could help you know. For instance... Stop the monkeys that are making those super kill pills or let people mourn when they've lost someone... Don't wipe their memory if they get depressed because it's actually your fault they are because they can't show their emotions the way they should... Okay, I'm stopping now. Moving on.) So you get it. The Program basically erases your memories. Takes the bad ones that make you 'sick' away. So if you show signs of being sick, they take you to one of the facilities and wipe your memory and then in the end you're happy again and all the bad stuff is gone. (I would rather take one of those kill pills instead of getting my memory wiped.) It's actually pretty original. But seriously. So many geniuses in the world and that's the best they could come up with? Tsss.So the main character in this story is Sloane. She is a really fun character and I loved her. I felt for her and I felt a lot. No kidding. The first part of the book is heartbreaking (the whole book is actually but okay). Her brother died, her best friend doesn't remember her, her other best friend dies and the boy she loves is taken from her too. Yeesh, talk about a hard life. But she is a fighter and she wants to hold on to James as long as she can. She doesn't want to forget. I love her for that. She's strong.The second half of the story is equally heartbreaking and a bit frustrating near the end. If you lose your memories, can you get them back? Does your heart remember what your mind forgot? That's the main question in the second half of the story. And it was so frustrating to know what she did not anymore. But I am sooo glad the way this book ended. And I can't wait for the next book.Oh and I love James. He's awesome and hot. And Realm is ... I don't know, I don't like him.Awesome book, I want the sequel. Like... Yesterday .
Actual Rating: 3,5 starsSing and the darkness will find you.With a sentence like that on the cover I was totally prepared to read an awesome book with some cool action and a kick-ass heroine. But... I expected to much because, although I liked it quite a bit, I still feel like it let me down. And I would've liked to know that the story takes place a few centuries ago. Between 1667 and 1669. Maybe that sounds stupid, but I like that kind of information beforehand. Not that it matters a lot in what time the story takes place, it's just a detail that's important to me.First of all, I liked the characters in this story. Lucy and every other character in it matter. How small their part may be, they're all important and I like that. So many books have characters that don't really help the story and are unnecessary, this one didn't. So that's a good thing. I wanted to see a little more from the villain though... We meet him once in the entire book and I can't even remember his name right now... He didn't really leave a big impression on me. The Shadowgrims are cool but they also don't play a big role yet. Maybe we'll get to see more of the bad guys in the sequel? Let's hope so!The story is well thought out. I do believe the author really took some time to work it all out, so that is good. But although it's interesting and quite original, is so slow. I would've liked to see more action, instead most of the book lucy is underground, hiding and training. Love the character developement we get from that, but it gets boring after a couple of hundred pages. I wanted more action! What I do like about that is the romance. It builds nice and slow. it's more realistic and it's not a big part of the story yet. But I think it will be in the books that follow. They probably shouldn't have called it romantic in the blurb, because it isn't that romantic yet.So this is a pretty good book and fans of the genre might like it. If you want a nice relaxing read, I recommend it as well. If you love books that move to the action quick, I wouldn't recommend it because this isn't one of those book. I really hope we get more action in the next book. The cover is awesome though .
4.5 starsAlthough I didn't expect it to, this book made me feel a lot and in the end, I sighed and smiled. This was such a beautiful story. Both sad and full of hope and love and friendship.Caroline's grandmother is very sick, probably dying. Along with her family, Caroline has been by her side since the stroke. With so much pressure building, all she wants is to escape and when Simone, her best friend, offers to take her to a party on that fateful Friday night, she ends up at a crossroads . Will she stay with her grandma? Or go to the party with Simone? Her decision splits her fate into two different paths and she's about to live them both. But which one is the right one?Oh my god, this boo is just... Epic. It's so damn relatable too. It's insane. The writing is great, I felt so much reading this book. Probably because a lot of people can relate to this. The story has three parts. Before, Stay and Go. First we have Before and after that you have one chapter Stay, the next Go and after that again Stay and so on. I liked the perspective that gave me. We saw how each of the two choices affected her life and family and friends and even love-life. Yeah, maybe it was a bit predictable, but honestly? I don't care. It was just a beautiful, amazing story and it ended just as I hoped it would and that's all that really matters in the end for me.I really liked the characters. Caroline is very easy to relate to. I mean, I know how she felt most of the time because I've been there. I understood it. I loved Simone and Natalie and Teddy and Chris and maybe even Joel. And I loved how everything blended together in the end. So beautiful!Amazing book with more depth to it than I expected at first and written so beautifully. I absolutely recommend this book to everyone who ever lost a loved one and everyone who is fortunate enough to have never gone through that pain.Warning! This book can and probably will make you cry. Especially if you cry easily while reading a book like this. It's a sob-fest, that's for sure. So.. better keep the Kleenex close .
First, I must say that I won't be talking about the characters very much because I can't do that without spoilers and since this is an ARC copy, I won't spoil anything. So if you want to talk or rant or fangirl about this book and it's characters, please send me a message! I need someone to talk with about this book, lol.The S-word is the brilliantly written debut of Chelsea Pitcher and I can't help but ask... Where in God's name have you been hiding all this time Chelsea? Why did you keep your talent from us for so long? It should be punished... But this book is great, so you are forgiven.Yes, this is a great book. More then that. It's a must-read and one of my new favorites of this year. (Maybe even of all time.) The writing is great and I was hooked to the story from the first sentence. I could not stop reading. I just had to know how it ended. Like I said, I can't talk about it much because I don't want to spoil anything, but I have to say that it did not end the way I thought it would. There are twists and turns I did not see coming. Nothing is what it seems, that's all I can say.I wanted to talk about bullying because it's a big theme in this novel, but I won't. It's bad and mean and low. I hate bullies. That's all.This book is captivating, full of drama and even romance and suspence. Brilliantly written, like I already said and Chelsea, you've got a new fan. I can't wait to read more from you in the future .
Honestly, this is not a genre I usually read. No, correction. This is not a genre I usually enjoy. But I did! I enjoyed this book! Surprisingly so.So, in this book the earth is dying. It's overrun and destroyed by humanity. The 'world government' has terraformed a new planet and is slowly bringing people to that planet. It has several POV's, both on earth and Exilon 5 (the new planet). And each character mattered and had their own voice!We have Bill, a high level government official who doesn't like the natives from the new planet (called Indigene) very much because he thinks they killed his wife. It follows a few natives and a few characters back on earth. The different POV's made it easier for me to get into the story, which is usually very hard for me in this genre. BUT, sometimes it felt like there were to many. Some were necessary, I get that, but some were not and I wouldn't have minded if those didn't have a separate POV.But the story was very fascinating and really original. It's a very good example of the issues that follow when a government has ultimate control over people. And I liked discovering the origins and background from the Indigenes. Very interesting to read. And it never got really predictable. Some parts were, but most of the time it surprised me.It's obvious this is the first part from a trilogy. This book covers most of the world-building and backstory (which is a huge plus) and introduces the characters to us. While doing all that, it makes me curious for the sequel. Very well done Eliza!If you love Sci Fi books or dystopian, you will like (or even love) this one too. I recommend it to them. If this genre is really not your thing, I don't but you might as well give it a try. Who knows, maybe it surprises you and you like it anyway .
Wow. This story was... Yeesh... It was great! It was romantic, dramatic, and hot. Yeah, seriously hot.In this book we meet Erin at a very hard time in her life. The first chapter, the prologue gave me tears in my eyes already. And then suddenly we're a few years later and Erin has promised herself not to love again in order not to get hurt again. Makes sense, right? I thought so. Love can be a bitch. But she didn't expect to meet Alek, who turns her world upside down and tries to break down the wall she build around herself.The story started out good, as I already said. But the first two chapters after the prologue didn't really get my attention and I was easily distracted from the book. That changed when I started chapter 3 and the story began to get more and more interesting every page I turned. The double POV really helped in that. It made the story better and it got to me more and more every chapter.The relationship isn't rushed and that is a very good thing. It's not an instant love kinda thing. It builds and grows as the story goes along and I loved that. When I was about 70% into the story, I got a feeling what was going to happen and I didn't want to be right, but I was and I was crying and sobbing and then the end came and I was crying happy tears. So it's an understatement when I say this book is an emotional roller coaster.I really liked Erin. She had a tough time when she was young and that made her shy away from anything new and avoids love at all cost because she doesn't want to get hurt. So when she meets Alek, she kind of tries to avoid him because he is a huge new thing. (A delicious and handsome one at that.) She doesn't want that in her perfectly organised life. But she opens up to him and grows. And I loved her in the end. Alek was... omg Alek. He's yummy. He has issues and a past but he also grows and opens up to Erin. They help each other and learn each other how to love again and that was one of the best things in this book in my opinion.I hated Lila, by the way. God what a *beeeeep*.So Kas, I really really REALLY loved your book and I hope I get more of Erin and Alek in the future? Or anything else from you in this genre is fine too.This review will also be on Goodreads, my blog and Barnes & Noble .
Surah and Charlie are the main characters here and they live in the world from The Alexa Montgomery Saga (which I really recommend by the way) and their story is set after the events from those books. That is just one thing that makes this book awesome. My expectations were really high for this one. H.D. did an amazing job on Alexa's story and I didn't think she could live up to that. I hoped for it, but I didn't think she would. And she didn't let me down. This book is beyond awesome.At first, Surah reminded me of Jasmine (you know, from Aladdin). She was a princess that didn't want to be a princess anymore with a huge tiger as a pet and best friend and she falls in love with a common boy. So I guess Charlie is kind of like Aladdin too. But Jasmine didn't have lavender hair and eyes and cool magic powers and she wasn't hundreds of years old. Surah is one kickass heroine. She can kick some as but at the same time, she struggles with the doubts within herself. Will she be what her father expects her to be? Or will she go her own way?Charlie was so cute and sweet! He has been in love with Surah for years. (Centuries actually.) He even wrote a song for her! Gosh, I want my own Charlie. *swoon*Do I even have to tell you how awesome Samson is? No. You know he is, even if you haven't read the book yet.I don't like Michael, he's an ass and for some reason I don't like Theo either. I just have a bad feeling about that guy.This story doesn't have a slow start. H.D.'s books never really have. She doesn't wait to start the action, she just does it. I love her so much. She is such an incredible writer and an amazing storyteller. She has a way with words that I can't describe. Every time I finish a book, I just sit in my chair for a moment. Speechless.On of the best things of this book? The romance. There is no insta-love here! Not at all. Charlie and Surah have been in love with each other for centuries (even though they have a hard time admitting that). I wouldn't exactly call that insta-love, would you? They are so sweet together and when Charlie sang that song to Surah, the hopeless romantic in me rejoiced.So long story short, this book is great. The world, the characters, the story. It is everything I wanted and more. Much more. Thank you H.D. for yet another amazing book. And hurry up on the sequel, please .
Jep, 3 stars. That's right. That's a pretty high rating for an angel book coming from me. But then again, this is not an ordinary angel book. And still I missed something in it. I think I, as always, expected more.So this is the story of Rosa. She is a hunter, a pretty good one actually. I liked her. She was a cool main character. I liked Jason and I liked the two of them together. Now, I don't exactly know what I missed in this book... Maybe I wanted a little more action? Maybe it's the end that disappointed me? I don't know. I only know that there was something missing in this book. The writing was okay. Pretty good, but not great either. The book overall was pretty average. Maybe it just isn't my thing. If you're a fan of angel books, you'll most likely like this book too. If not, you might not like this one, but then again, this is just my opinion .
2.5 starsWell... I'm sad to say this but I'm so happy I finished this book because I didn't think I'd make it through it. I didn't like it that much. There were some good elements, but for the most part I was frustrated, annoyed and bored. And I'll explain why.This book is about Hailey. Hailey has been famous and in the spotlight for as long as she can remember. But she's getting tired off all that. So she's going to college. Start over. But that's easier said than done. Classes are harder than she thought they'd be and her mother is determined to ruin her life because of her choice to leave Hollywood. And there's Caleb Fox, the guy she never expected. He doesn't want her for her fame, he just wants her. And Hailey isn't sure if she can give him what he wants. And what if he finds out the one secret the tabloids don't know yet? Will he still be there?First the bad things. Get it over with.1) I didn't like the writing that much. It was pretty simple and there were a lot of cliche things in the story. And some of the things the characters said were just... No. Just no. I can compare it to the writing in Fifty Shades. Not exactly the best I've ever seen.2) Hailey was SO annoying! Most of the time I was thinking: `Why do you have to be that way? Seriously! Why???' Whenever someone wants to be friends with her, she immediately thinks they want that because they're famous. Yeesh. And when she walks into a room at school she's like: `Oh hey nobody stops and stares. That's weird.' Again... No. Just no. On top of that, in the blurb they mention some secret and I thought it would be something big that would make the story a whole lot better but when I read what it was... I was banging my head against the table. Such a stupid stupid thing. Why would anybody hate you for that? It's not like you're the only one in the world to have done that. Seriously. NO. That's all I'm going to say about her for now.3) The insta-love. Well not really love but they do have an instant attraction to each other and even before talking to each other, they NEED to have the other person. They just NEED to kiss and all that. Yeah... Also a no for me.Now the good.1) I actually liked Caleb. He was a sweet guy and cares for Hailey (even though I wouldn't understand why...) And I liked most of the other characters too. Griff may be my soulmate.2) The story itself wasn't that bad. If the writing had been better, I probably would have liked the book a lot more. And Hailey too.Okay that's it for this review. I'm sorry I didn't like it, but hey that's the way it is sometimes .
3.5 stars!Okay, I liked this story! I didn't really love it, but I liked it! And The Devil's Tattoo has got to be the coolest bandname ever. Seriously.Zoe Granger started playing guitar ever her heart was broken into a million pieces. And music has been her escape ever since. Then her best friend Dee suggest they start a band and everything goes quick after that. They call themselves The Devil's Tattoo and after releasing their first EP, it's on top of the sharts in no time. Contracts, photo shoots, interviews,... Everything has changed in such a short amount of time. Then they're asked to tour with the hot indie band The Stabs. Will is the bass player of that band and he only has eyes for Zoe, but Zoe doesn't trust guys that easy and she doesn't want her heart broken again. But Will is determined. This tour is either going to be a highway to hell or a stairway to heaven.I liked the story. It's really cool! I love music and this is pretty realistic. Things can go very quick very sudden and I liked that! The writing was good too, although it was a bit fast in the beginning and I didn't quite understand the situation between Will and Zoe because of that. It seemed like insta-love, but it wasn't. It just seemed that way because of the fact that we skip through a couple of months in the first few chapters. But it got better once they started the tour and even though I liked those two together, I kind of wanted Zoe to fall for her best friend because they were so funny together! Their conversations are hilarious and they seem like a married couple after 30 years of marriage. Seriously cool. The whole band is that way. It's like a family and I love that!I liked the characters. Zoe is cool and I get where she comes from. And I adore Dee, he's just awesome. I really liked all of them and I'm happy that I got to know them!If you love books about bands and music and friendship and all that, you'll probably like this one too. So try it out! Maybe it's something for you .
What's up with the dystopian novels these days? Almost every single one I've read in the last month were great. I've read some bad ones in the past and lost hope a little for the genre, but David Estes' The Moon Dwellers gave me hope again and since then, my hope grew and I can now officially say that I love this genre once again. And this book was no different. I really liked it!Two Thirds of the world's population is wiped out after the worst war ever seen on the planet Earth. One of the survivors is Charlotte, a girl that can read minds. After losing her family, the New World leader takes her with him and soon she becomes his secret weapon. Her job is to make sure the rebels stay down, where they belong. Until one of them sneaks past her defences and makes her feel things she never felt before. But will this love save them or end them?I don't know why I've read anything by Janelle before. I mean... I wanted too, but never got it. I even won a copy of Eden in a giveaway a few weeks ago. I just didn't get to it I guess. But I will soon, because I love her! She's a great writer and I love her style. I'm normally not a big fan of writing in first person, but I didn't really mind in this book. But it is one of two the things that kept this book from being 5 stars. The second one being the fact that the double POV was a bit confusing in the beginning. I was really invested in the first one, Charlotte's, and then it switches to another person. And it's because of that first person writing, that it was so confusing. But that's really the only bad thing I can say about this book. I love the way Janelle created the world the story takes place in and I just love Janelle. Next to talented, she's also a very sweet and nice woman.I like the characters too. Charlotte is pretty badass. I'm sure she can kick some ass if she needs to. Yeah, she's beautiful, but they don't really use that as a weapon. She has to wear a mask to keep the fact that she's a girl a secret, so that's another thing I liked. She grows a lot in this book and even though she is a badass heroine, she's still vulnerable. That makes her human and relatable.I liked Pete too and Ramon and Ludwig and all the other characters, but Charlotte's my favorite, so.I am going to read the sequel when it's out and I definitely recommend it to everyone who loves dystopian novels .
3.5 stars!To be clear, I enjoyed this book. It was pretty good and the characters were awesome, but at times it was a bit... boring. I think some people will compare it to twilight, and it is similar, like so many books are, but this book at least has fun and entertaining Main Characters. And the writing is good. I just would've liked to see more action, more... something. Maybe in the second book?Sunshine is about Sophie. She has an allergy for the sun which means she's almost as pale as Caspar, Snow White or a vampire. At least, that's what the kids at school say. But she doesn't really care anymore. She has two amazing best friends and she can always count on her family. Well most of them anyway. And then Myles comes along. It's clear from the start that something's up with him. He has secrets, but so does Sophie. Both of them have a past they do not wish to share. But as they grow closer, more and more secrets will be revealed.So this story is good and well... Like I said, it was a bit boring. For the most part of the story, nothing really happens. Myles and Sophie get to know each other and their friendship grows and blossoms into something more eventually, but nothing exciting really happens until we hit the 80% mark. If the characters weren't as fun and cool as they were, I wouldn't have given this book the rating I just gave. But it's nice to see a friendship grow into something more between two people. Especially a human and vampire. Yeah, no surprise there. Most of the book is told in the blurb, which made it a bit predictable. Oh and by the way, not to sound like a total geek, but in the above quote... Charmander first evolves into Charmeleon and then Charizard. (Okay yeah, I'm a geek.)I think it's clear that I loved the characters. Sophie is pretty cool. She has a milky white skin, dark magenta hair and wears combat boots. Seriously. Awesome. And yeah, she has issues to deal with from the past, but I get it. There is a depth to her and I liked that. And I loved seeing her growing and learning to care of someone other then her two awesome best friends. Talking about best friends. In this case we have a Korean brother and sister, Boo and Trei (as in peek-a-book and tree). They are soooo cool and funny. And there are some other well-developed side-characters like the stepdad and sisters and high-school barbie bitches. But I hated Sophie's mom. Not exactly mother-of-the-year material. But I really loved Myles! He's a cool vampire and he cares for her. I like the vampires in this book by the way. They're cool.So overall I liked this book. And the ending pretty much made up for the boring parts in the rest of the book. So I'm excited to read the next book sometime in the future! And I do recommend this book to people who love the genre and want to see a relationship that grows for a change. No insta-love in this book! Hurray! But okay. So check this book out people .
Wow. I really hoped I would like this book because it's just in my wheel house with the elemental stuff. But you know what? I didn't like this book. Not at all. I F-ing LOVED it! YES you read that right. I just gave 5 stars to a dystopian novel. And everyone who knows me knows that that is pretty rare. Just as rare as someone calling 50 Shades a literary masterpiece.So this is your basic dystopian world (not really). The world is in ruins after a lot of shit has happened and now people live in domes all across the world. It's only safe in those domes and even there life is hard. Avery lives in Dome Four. She's one of the Elementalists, one of the best. She generates steam for the dome. Without steam, no oxygen, no electricity, nothing. But Avery feels more like a pawn than an Elite. And when a man called Riggs offers her a way out, offers her freedom, it's hard to resist. But even there, nothing is what it seems. Even there where she's supposed to be free, are lies.I loved the story. Next to the obvious reason with the elements, it's just a good dystopian book. The writing was really good. I can't really describe it, it just was so fun and nice reading this book. Megan Curd has a very good style of writing. Everything plays like a movie in my head and I love that. The worldbuilding is great. It's not so much you get bored, but not so little you don't understand a thing either. It's just enough and it's great. I got sucked into this story right away. And I just loooove when that happens.Now I've got to talk about some of the characters. Not all of them because of spoilers, but some of them. First off, Avery. Man I love her. She's got some serious spunk. Talk about a kick-ass main character. She's awesome. I loved Alice too. She may seem like a shy and quiet girl, but she's not. She's cool and I like her. Sari too, she's cool. Also pretty kick-ass. And Legs. He's funny and I love him too. And Jaxon. My god. I have a new book boyfriend. Damn.I can't talk about any of the other characters because I would spoil the whole book if I did. And I don't roll that way.Would I read this book again? Hells yeah. Will I read the sequels? Hells yeah. Would I recommend it to anyone? You betcha.This book is perfect for fans of the dystopian genre. Even fans of fantasy will like/love this book. If you're a fan of books with elemental stuff like me, you'll really love this book. So read it. Like... now .
Seriously Dara, you never disappoint me. Every book of you I read, is awesome. That's the reason I agreed to beta this new series for you. I knew it would be great and I knew I would love it. That's why I said I would make room in my schedule for you anytime. Because you are an amazingly talented writer and I love you!So this story is about Kat, a were-leopard (really, those exist? Never heard of it before, but it's cool!) who grew up with a pack of werewolves. She has a secret relationship with the soon-to-be Alpha male of the pack, Jason. And he's the reason she has to leave. Because he can't claim her as his. Because of who she is, she can't be Alpha female. So she leaves everything behind.Seven years go by and she's build a new life with a normal human called Marc. But it doesn't last long. She meets other were-leopards and soon she finds herself in a whole lot of trouble. So she has to go back to her pack, because that's the only place she can be safe. That also means she has to see Jason again. And of course, trouble follows her as does passion, lust, love and more trouble.As I said already, the writing is great and I didn't expect less from Dara. I know she's very talented. She just has a way of making everything become more realistic. Not many authors can do that. Especially in this genre. I mean, paranormal romance with very specific erotic scenes? It's kind of hard to make it realistic. Especially when it's about were-leopards and werewolves. I loved the story too. It's original and really, really hot! And the romance is good too. Although I'm a bit split about which one I like the most. So you have Kat and Jason to begin with. They have a history and I get that. They grew up together and fell in love, so it's certainly the most believable. And it's not insta-love. And Kat does love him a lot, that is until James comes in her life. But first Marc. He is a human and they were together when she wasn't with the pack. He disappeared and I don't know what happened to him, but I hope I'll find out in the next book. She forgets him kind of quickly. And yes, James. They are the same in many ways and it's only normal they're attracted to each other and all that. But still... Kat was kind of quick with moving on from Jason and Marc and falling for James.I liked Kat, she's a cool character, but I did find her a bit annoying. You know, she's a real cat in heat and she jumps from one guy to the next (not literally) fairly quick and that annoyed me. She loved Jason first then she left. She loved Marc and ran back to the pack for her safety right into the arms of Jason once again and then stuff happens and there's James. So. But I liked her, she's got spunk and she's pretty stubborn, so that's cool. And I liked James too. Didn't see Marc that much, so I don't know about him yet. But Jason... I liked him, but I didn't get to know how that good. So I hope I get to know him better in the next book. And all the other characters are cool too.Thanks to Dara, for letting me beta-read this book. I'm starting the next book tomorrow! I recommend this to fans of the genre or people who love erotic romance novels with a paranormal twist. D.T. Dyllin is an awesome writer and I will read anything she writes because I know it will be good. So, D. Whenever you got new stuff to beta, don't ask, just send it to me okay .
My first thought after finishing this book was: `Wow, this is a comic in book form.' And that's not a bad thing. Absolutely not. I love comics with superheroes and all that stuff. And I read this pretty quick. Got through it in less than 3 hours.This book is about Jim, a teenage boy with super powers. He moonlights as a Super Bounty Hunter under the name Mohawk and he's also known as Kid Sensation. He got into the trials of the Academy, a place where all teen with powers go to see if they can become a superhero. And because of some super ass he didn't get a chance to enter even though he was qualified.I enjoyed this book because I love all things superhero (Marvel, DC Comics, ... that sort of stuff. And elements. Let' s not forget those). Yeah, I'm a geek. But it was not really that special for me. It had a few flaws, which brought the book down a lot. It was a bit confusing with the flashbacks too. The writing was okay but there were some typos. I didn't have to think that much while reading and sometimes that's not a bad thing. But when there was a flashback, that changed and I was confused because I didn't immediately got the fact that it's a flashback. I do like the cover, it gives the book the whole comic book vibe I got when I finished it.I liked the characters, but there were cliches. I don't mind a few, but in this book, there were quite a lot of them. Overall this is a good book to read when I'm lazy and just want to put my mind off things and have a good time. It's that sort of book. And there's nothing wrong with that .
I liked this book. The story was good, the characters also goo, the writing good. I was pleasantly surprised, to be honest. I didn't expect to like it as much as I did.. I didn't really connect with the characters though... I don't know why... Even so, this was a nice read and maybe I will read it again in the future, who knows? I will be reading other books by this author for sure.I loved getting to know Maine. I didn't really knew that much about it, so I was happy to get such depth and detail of it's history, landscape and all that. I really loved that!Another thing I loved was the mystery in this book and how it unfolded. Maybe it's a weird thing to say, but I predictable but unpredictable. My head hurts trying to figure that one out. xDSo this is a good book and I liked it. But it wasn't more then that for me. Good, but not great. That's why I gave it 3.5 stars. Good job A.D.! I look forward to read more from you in the future .
I really liked this book. I really did. It was original and I loved the mystery and the riddle Matty has to solve and I loved discovering it with him. This was a pretty good book.So this is the story of Matty. He's really smart. Seriously. I had a headache when he was talking or thinking smart things. Wendy did her research on that department. I liked the world she created and the references to this time. You know, the months, Yesa (I see what you did there Wendy, smart, really smart, lol.), That was really cool. So this smart guy doesn't like the school he goes to because the teachers are actually less smart then he is and he is bored all the time. So the King offers him a master's diploma but first he has to answer the question: What was January Black? It's a ship, but that's not the answer the King wants. So Matty has to figure out what January Black really was and I loved that we learned everything together with him. It kept me guessing and it was so fascinating. This was a really fascinating book.I loved Matty. Like I said, he gave me a headache every now and then, but I liked him. For some reason I kept hearing his voice in a British accent. Don't know why. I loved Iris and they were very cute together. It didn't feel forced and it was nice to see them grow as a couple. To see them fall in love with each other. I didn't know whether or not to like King Hadrian. Some times I did, then I didn't. Same with his dad. But I loved his mother.I don't exactly know what genre this is exactly. YA fantasy I think. So if you love that genre, you should read this book. If you don't, but you like books with mystery and smart guys that gives you a headache and sound British in your head, then you should read it too. I actually recommend it. The British accent thing. It's kind of sexy .
Actual rating: 3,5 starsThe Grave Winner is Lindsey's first book and yes, I noticed that sometimes in this book, but I always take that into consideration when I read because everyone makes beginners mistakes. So I tried not to pay to much attention to those. But overall this was a good debut. It was funny (hilarious at times), creepy, mysterious and just a fun read. I definitely had a good time reading it. And I'm still itchy by the way Lindsey. Nice thing you did there. Lol.I loved Leigh, she was very witty and I was really laughing out loud at times. And sarcastic. That was very relatable because my humor is usually very sarcastic to. I loved Jo and Sarah, even though Sarah was a little creepy at times... I liked Tram and Cal and all the other characters.This really is a good ghost story and a perfect book to read around Halloween (other times too, but it really reminded me of a book for Halloween, so...) Oh and I love the cover, fits the story very nice .
1.5 starsIf you've been reading my reviews for a while now, you know angel books can be a hit or a miss for me. This was not a hit, unfortunately. Though the blurb and the cover make it look and sound like a great book, it wasn't for me. Not at all.I'm not going to waste anytime giving a short summary of the book. This book was so frustrating and those were the longest 200 pages ever. It didn't seem to end and while that is a good thing with some books, it wasn't for this one. I couldn't wait for it to end. The writing was... not good. Not even okay. This book needs a good editor. Some things just sounded ridiculous. And I didn't feel anything throughout the book. Part of that was probably because of the characters, which I'll explain in a minute. The book was a bit boring too. Nothing really happened until the second half of the book and by then it already lost my interest. Some of the action scenes weren't that bad, but still. It took a whole lot more to make me love the book. Or even like it.The events in this book take place over just a few days and despite that the romance in this book is insta-love. Sigh. I'm starting to hate it. With a passion. Seriously. Especially in this book. Again, the characters. Okay, let's just get straight to it.I was never so frustrated by characters before. Not even Bella from Twilight. I'm serious. Even though her name is Emma Wise, she certainly isn't wise or smart. And no depth at all. The book starts out when they're bringing her in the hospital after a horrible car crash in which her parents died. It's a miracle she even survived. The next day, they tell her she's moving to Alaska the next day to some aunt. You'd think that she'd mourn the loss of her parents, but noooo. She's angry because she has to leave her friends and stuff behind. And the next day, Kade comes to pick her up. She's instantly in love with him. Again, her parents just died two days ago and she thinks about the boy and how hot he is? -Sigh- Then they leave for alaska and on the plane Kade tells her she'll be homeschooled and that makes her angry again because that's not fair and she can't spend her senior year being homeschooled. And blah blah blah. No emotions. At all.Then there are the best friends. One of the things her friend asks is: What happened to your cell? At that point, I was screaming to my e-reader. Your best friend just miraculously survived a deadly car crash. What the hell do you think happened to her cell phone? Ugh.Is it normal in the US that people who miraculously survived a deadly car crash can leave the hospital and go on a plane the next day? I don't know that but it sounds pretty stupid.There have never been so much caps in my notes before. So yeah, I was frustrated a lot reading this book and I am so so SO happy I finished it because I never thought I would. So I'm sorry, but I can't say that I recommend this book to anyone. I guess if you love angel books, you might as well give it a try because I want to know if there is anyone who shares my opinion. Sigh .
3.5 starsI liked this book! :) As you may or may not know, I have a weakness for books/movies about people with elemental powers, so this one belongs on that list too. It wasn't the best ever and sometimes the romance between Ryan and Natalie seemed a bit... rushed. It almost is one of those instant-love thingies you often read in books nowadays. And I'm not really a fan of that. But overall this was a fun book and I liked it. I really did. And I would read the sequel because I want to know what happens next.ARC courtesy of the author. Received a free copy in exchange for an honest review as a beta reader .
So an omnibus... Never reviewed one before, so I'm glad I liked this one! At some points it felt like 1 really long book, which is good. It flowed nicely from one book to the next and that's very awesome in a book. I hate it when it just jumps from one thing to another and this book didn't do that.The writing was good, although sometimes a bit simplistic than I'm used to in this genre, but that's okay. There's great character developement, they all grow throughout the series and that's awesome. The magic in this book was really cool and the world building was very well done. The romance in this book was sweet and emotional and it really fit into the story without taking it over to much.If you're a fan of this genre, I really recommend these books. They are written good and the story's great. =)Yeah, I know this is a short review, but I can't talk much about it without spoilers since I'm reviewing three books at once. Just read it, okay .
3.5 starsI'm surprised to say that I really liked this book! It was a pretty cool and original concept and it worked out well. I found a few typos, but they didn't bother me that much. Kimberly gives her own spin on mermaids and sirens and mixed that with some cool action, fantastic underwater scenes and a passionate romance.Waterborn is about Caris. She just moved to a little town near the sea from Kentucky with her dad and she can't help but feel different here. Like the sea is calling her. And then she meets Noah, not knowing what he is. Noah is a waterbreather and he hears Caris' song in his head and he can't help but feel attracted to her. Soon enough, Caris finds out what and who she is. But is that really who she wants to be?The writing in this book was very good. I couldn't put this book down once I picked it up. I was pulled into Caris' world and wanted to find the answers to her questions just as much as she did. The story was cool and I got just the right amount of action and in the end my questions were answered. The romance was so sweet and passionate at the same time, I couldn't get enough of it.But despite the fact that there was some action, I never felt like it was enough. I kept waiting for something big, but it never really happened. And that took a bit from the story for me. I wanted more.I really liked Caris, she was a cool main character, but sometimes she annoyed me quite a bit. I can't even tell you why because I don't know. Maybe the way she acted around Noah in the beginning? And I liked Noah, he was sweet and he had some issues to deal with. And I got that. And it wasn't really insta-love between him and Caris because of the whole siren-song thing. I didn't like Sol and Pax, obviously. I loved Maggie and Erin and Caris' dad. I'm a bit conflicted about Athen, though. I'm not sure if I should like him or hate him.Overall, this is a good mermaid-ish story. Kimberly gave her own spin on it all and that was pretty cool but I finished the book wanting more. So yes, I have yet to find a book in this genre that completely blows my socks off. But I do recommend it, maybe you like it more than I did .
Well, Heather... You've done it again. This was one hell of a book. Mind-blowing, all-consuming, can't-look-away-even-if-I-tried, breathtaking, heart-pounding,... Words just aren't enough to describe what I think of this book. It was all that and more. Especially the romance. Well... I expected it actually. Having read all but one of H.D. Gordon's books, I knew it would be awesome. And it sure was. Damn.Falling Stars starts right where Shooting Stars left off. Now I can't tell too much about it because of spoilers, so I'll just say that Surah and Charlie are in for a breathtaking romance and a whole lot of trouble. This series is starting to prove itself to be just as epic as the Alexa Montgomery Saga was.Just as in all the other books, the writing was awesome. Heather has a way of pulling me into a story and never letting me go. Not even for a second. I was right there with Surah and Charlie and even Samson. I felt like I was a part of their journey. And what a journey it was. Just the right amount of action and the romance... I'll say it again... Damn. My heart stopped several times over the course of this book only to pound a hundred times faster when it started back up again. And it literally made me gasp at some points. Not just the romance, but the whole book. I love how I'm pulled into each and every book Heather wrote and feel so many things. And I loved the fact that we got some chapters from Samson's Point of view. He is without a doubt the most awesome pet animal.I think it's safe to say that Surah is one of the most awesome characters ever. She's no spoiled princess that needs a knight in shining armor to help her when she's in trouble. Surah can handle herself, and how. She can seriously kick some ass. And I love for that. The most awesome princess ever. (With the most awesome pet ever.) And Charlie... Charlie. I can't think of him without getting a big fat smile on my face and a deep sigh. Though he, too, can kick serious ass, he's also very sweet and caring and just... perfect in my eyes. I love him. And it's pretty obvious I love Samson too. But I hate Michael and actually... I hate Theo too. Just don't like him.One last thing before I end this review... What is up with that ending Heather? Seriously??? Are you kidding me? I'm sure somewhere in the world this is a form of torture. Just... Just give me the next book okay? Like... Yesterday.Fans of H.D. Gordon will love this book. And people who haven't read anything from her yet... Well I suggest you better get started. Read the Alexa Montgomery Saga first. It's not necessary but you'll understand some things in these series better when you do. If you love fantasy and an amazing romance, I highly recommend Heather's books .
2.5 starsAlthough this book started strong and had an emotional moment towards to end, most of the time I was just bored. Most books in this genre are basically the same, but it&#8217;s the way it&#8217;s executed that matters. And I&#8217;m really sorry that I have to say this, but this one was just not that good for me personally.Ember&#8217;s world comes crashing down on her when she learns her father has died in Afghanistan. Her mother becomes a zombie and she&#8217;s the one that has to keep everything together. And than her jerk of a boyfriend, Riley becomes the most hated person for me in this book and the only one Ember can find comfort in is Josh. It&#8217;s a pretty standard story, but it felt so long and I was so bored through most of it. The beginning was so good. The first few chapters had me in tears, but when Josh came along, I lost that connection. In the end is a moment that was very emotional and I had tears in my eyes from it, but for the rest I just didn&#8217;t care. And I think the problem for me is with the characters.Ember is not a great character, but she&#8217;s okay. She has to take care of her brother and sister and mom after her father&#8217;s dead. And she&#8217;s okay. But her mom. In the first half of the book she&#8217;s practically a zombie. She does nothing but sleep and she doesn&#8217;t care anymore. I get it, she&#8217;s sad and I&#8217;ve been there, but she has responsibilities! She has kids to take care of! Ember shouldn&#8217;t have to change her whole life just because her mom doesn&#8217;t want to do anything anymore! And Ember&#8217;s grandmother comes to help, but she doesn&#8217;t do much either. April is&#8230; I don&#8217;t know. Just okay I guess. She goes off the rails for a bit but that&#8217;s it. Her little brother Gus is the one I cared about the most. In the beginning of the book, the first chapter, Ember has to tell him their father died. This is a bit from that moment.&#8220;Daddy isn&#8217;t coming home, Gus.&#8221;Little blue eyes filled with tears, and his lower lip began to quiver. &#8220;Did the bad guys get him?&#8221;It broke my heart! I felt so sad for that little guy! But he was the only one I really felt something for. Josh was also okay. He&#8217;s exactly what I expected him to be. He&#8217;s Gus&#8217; hockey coach and he and Ember went to the same school for a while years ago. The romance between him and Ember is just&#8230; weird. It started weird and I didn&#8217;t feel a connection to them so I think that&#8217;s why the book was so boring to me. And then you have Riley and Kayla. Ember&#8217;s boyfriend and best friend. They&#8217;re stupid. He&#8217;s an ass and a dick. And he&#8217;s pathetic. And Kayla&#8217;s a bitch. Why? Well, it&#8217;s not really a spoiler because it happens in the beginning, but I&#8217;ll hide it anyway. -SPOILER- Riley doesn&#8217;t show up at the funeral and a weeks after it he has a party and Ember goes to surprise him, (Josh was so kind to give her a ride) and there she finds him sleeping with Kayla. Like actual sex. And she finds out they&#8217;ve been doing it for a year. The worst thing about it, is that Ember and Riley had been together for three years and they had their whole life planned out. And Riley wanted to wait until they were married before they had sex. She didn&#8217;t want to, he did. And he has the words excuses for it. And he comes begging for her forgiveness throughout most of the book and I just wanted to hit him so hard. And the night she finds all that out, is also the night she just starts everything with Josh. Which is why it&#8217;s weird. Her dad just died, she just broke up with her cheating boyfriend after three years and then she immediately wants to have sex with him. That&#8217;s just weird. -END SPOILER-In the end it just didn&#8217;t do it for me. I was bored most of the time and except for a few emotional moments involving Ember&#8217;s dad, I didn&#8217;t really feel anything. I would recommend it to fans of the genre. Maybe you&#8217;ll love it! I hope you do! So give it a shot .
4.5 stars!I&#8217;ve been waiting and wanting to read this one for months now and when Stephanie said it was ready for beta-reading, I was so happy! Even though it&#8217;s long, like a proper fantasy novel usually is, I really really loved it. So take a deep breath Steph, nothing to fear in this review.The Lost Kingdom takes place in Ilendia and it&#8217;s about Arima, a sixteen year old girl whose world is turned upside down when she finds out she&#8217;s Lady Spirit, one of the five Ladies of Elements. According to a centuries old Prophecy, she has to unite all the five Ladies and save Ilendia and the Other Lands from Ahriman, the Demon King. Even though Arima has no choice but accept the destiny she never even wanted and go on a journey into the unknown.The Lost Kingdom was originally published in Dutch and Stephanie wanted to take it to the next level and started translating it herself so more people were able to read it and yes, she&#8217;s going indie! She has been working very hard on this for months now and I&#8217;ve been helping wherever I can. I&#8217;m sort of a PR person for her, a beta reader,&#8230; But above all, her best friend. And honestly, I was terrified I wouldn&#8217;t like it that much because it would break my heart if I had to write a negative review. Luckily, I loved it!This has everything a good YA Fantasy book needs. A cool, brilliant world? Check! A strong, pretty bad ass heroine? Check! A scary, evil villain? Check! Mystery, Magic and more of that good stuff? Check, check and check! Plus I did get a lot of feels from it too! Especially in the beginning and at the end. And elemental magic powers!! That&#8217;s the thing I loved the most because I love it when a book has that. The world Stephanie created was amazing and in the Dutch copy there is a map, but the one that made it left out some of the most important cities so it&#8217;s not very helpful. I don&#8217;t know if there will be a map in the English book too, but if not, you&#8217;ll have to use your imagination. And Stephanie does a good job at helping you with that. The whole land/world was in my head!Of course, with Fantasy sometimes comes strange words. And there are some in this one too. Creatures I didn&#8217;t know because they were made up, a language that was also made up. There is a legend at the end with all the meanings of those words and names, but I think I pronounce them very, very wrong in my head so. That&#8217;s a bit confusing, but I got used to it. And most Fantasy books I know (like the ones from James Clemens, Robin Hobb, Terry Goodkind,&#8230;) are very long and this one is too in my opinion. It has 332 pages in the beta stage and before you say that that&#8217;s not long at all, it is because these are normal pages in the PDF format. So if she would print it out, that&#8217;s how many standard sized pages there would be. So it&#8217;s long, but that&#8217;s not a bad thing because Stephanie really takes her time to develop this story and its characters. Yeah it can get a little, tiny bit boring. BUT, there&#8217;s a but! Just when you&#8217;re starting to feel like putting the book down, something happens that hooks you again and you&#8217;re back on track!I really loved Arima. She really grows a lot in this book and I like that. She doesn&#8217;t want to be Lady Spirit at first and denies everything. But then something happens and she&#8217;s forced to flee from her village and she has to grow up pretty quick and learn more about these new powers she has. And she can really kick some ass if she needs too. The battle at the end is pretty epic. It&#8217;s not very long, but the book is, so appreciated the fact that Stephanie didn&#8217;t drag the battle out just to make it longer. And on her journey she meets several fun characters. Blythe, Myrddin, Laguun, &#8230; And of course her unicorn, Sirrim. No it&#8217;s not as lame as it sounds, the unicorn is also pretty bad ass.So if you&#8217;re looking for an awesome YA Fantasy book in the style of James Clemens, Terry Goodkind (and more), this is a good choice! I really loved it and I can&#8217;t wait to see what happens next .
A great read for every parent of a college bound student.  Too often, parents have blinders on - they really don't want to know what college is going to cost.  Dr. Ronstadt shows the true cost and then many strategies to reduce it.  His sections on College Success are amazing .
I think it is great.  I do like that it is written in real language.  Not like Anne of Green Gables.  I read so I do not have to watch tv or listen to it.  It is my quiet time.  I get involved and it is nice to read this.  It is easy to follow.  I think most any one that likes a little mystery would like this .
This is a cute short book.  Very interesting the thinking of the time.  I found it a nice escape for one afternoon.  Not of this era it is nice look at the turn of the last Century.  Enjoy .
This book was so good! I can't wait for the next one! Such a cliffhanger and a great read! Love .
Excellent.  Exactly what the ad said.  Couldn't be happier! :-) They are not  cheap like others I have bought.  Recommend .
Great gameplay an story, if you're a fan of the comic, this game is great, once I started playing I couldn't stop .
Are you tired of your life? Do you do things that don't bring any meaning in to your life? Are you so busy that you have never thought of these questions before? Do you own a Ferrari? You can spend couple of hours reading this book and might find the answers to your questions or you can keep on rushing and realize these things by yourself on the last day of your life!Robin Sharma is really a great story teller. The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari is a book full of wisdom, advises and lessons about life wrapped in a beautiful story of human transformation and finding a meaning in life. I liked this book, because everything is explained in a simple story way. The main line of the book is about the lawyer who had all the success and lots of money but still lost the meaning and passion in life. Author tells us simple principles which most people forget by rushing over their lives. He reminds us what it really means to live and enjoy everyday blessings. All the book consists of many insights and advises presented in a ear-catching manner.Most people these days rush to make careers, earn money and does other &#34;need to do&#34; things don't even realizing that they are quitting on their real dreams and passions in life. Most people are just doing things not even realizing that they are caught in a closed circuit and really don't go anywhere. Most people are not happy with their lives and those things they are doing are not bringing them any joy. Most people are trying their best for their family, but forgetting the most important - to spend time with the family. This book might be the answer to the question, why are they not happy yet. Happiness is a state of mind that consists of many small blessings in life and most people are just rushing for many things that don't make their lives any more happy and meaningful.  This book might open your eyes and make you see life through a different angle.As hearing some people talking about this book I also noticed one dangerous thing. And that thing is money topic. For some people it might seem that money is not an important thing, but it really is and I don't believe that Robin wants to justify poverty. Money is a tool, to make your life easier and get things you want and you don't need to misunderstand the attitude that money becomes everything in life. Believe me, if you don't have money, happiness is a lot more difficult state to understand. Even the book is called The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari, so you need to have that Ferrari at first in order to be able to sell it. This book is not a permission to make excuses why you are not rich or have not enough money. It just gives you lessons on how to be happy and live a meaningful life.So what car do you drive and which car would you really like to drive .
Most people would say that love is very important in their life and relationship, but how many people really know what love is? Most people don't even have any idea how to love themselves and they already try to love others. Most people are trained how to love by their parents, surroundings and most people don't even realize that the real intimacy of two souls starts in a much different place and proceeds in a much different way!I believe that discovering yourself should be the main task in any person's life! And Paulo Coelho is a master at writing great novels on this topic. It's his second book that I've got a chance to read and I am really very happy that I did so. As I loved The Alchemist, I loved this book even more, but I still think that you should read The Alchemist first!This book caught my attention from the start and I couldn't wait to see what will happen going further through the pages. Every page of the book got my attention until the book was finished. Author touches many interesting themes in this book like love, marriage, fame, obsession, transformation, loss, discovery and journey into yourself. I was really impressed on author's point of view about love in this book. This book even could be read as an amazing and dramatic love story with a happy ending. It could also be read as a discovery of yourself, transformation of human soul. Or it could be read as everything mentioned above. That's the beauty of this story, it is not just a nice love story, but it's also a very deep and philosophical analysis of human behavior and soul.The main line of the book is about the main character who is looking for his lost wife. The story starts from him being arrested for suspicion of being related to his wife's disappearance. The rest of the book is a journey of a great search for his wife. It just a very short description of the book, but everything is more complicated. It's not just a journey to find his wife, it's a journey to discover the real himself as well. The journey into realizing real love, attraction and real intimacy of two souls.I would greatly encourage everyone to read this book. It doesn't matter if you are single, married, divorced or living together for 20 boring (or maybe exciting) years. I believe, that if you read this book with open heart, you will find a lot of spices to make your life and relationship more wonderful than you could have imagined before.So, what is your Zahir .
Are you tired of your life? Do exactly the same Mondays and other days of the week don't make sense to you? Do you feel that there is something more waiting in life for you? If you have such or similar questions I believe this book can be an answer for you! But just reading it and not practicing is not going to make any changes in your life!This book is sequel to Robin's bestseller The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari. Basically it's very similar to the mentioned book, but everything is expanded and explained in more details. The plot is simple, the same monk who sold his Ferrari is sharing his wisdom with the man who has everything in life, but lost meaning of it. He almost ended with a suicide, but accidentally something stopped him and that something became a breakthrough in his life.What I like in this book is that Sharma takes us step by step through all 7 steps of self-awakening. In a story telling way he explains us why they are important and how you can master them. He gives us many advices and insights that can help to transform anyone's life. To make those steps and advises more emphasized the hero of the books teaches his apprentice one step at a time, by showing a lesson each time and making him to experience everything by himself, not just to hear the advice. That makes this book more practical to use for everyone who want great changes in their lives.I believe there are many lost souls in this world and this practical book can really help to find a real yourself and a real meaning of your life. Even if this one book won't help, I believe it will be a first huge step to discover your destiny!So, is your next Monday going to be the same as your last 30 Mondays .
Amazingly shocking and mind-blowing! Masterpiece that you won't forget for a long time! Very futuristic look at the utopian society, technologies and lifestyle. This book really blow me away! It immediately became my favorite novel I've ever read.Brave New World takes us to a very far future, even though it was written about 80 year ago. Aldous Huxley really made a fantastic work, which I was so much surprised and amazed to read. This book got my attention from the start and I couldn't put it away till the end. Life and society are much different in Brave New World. They live by different mindset, values, purpose and meaning than we do in today world (or it just might look like so from the first sight). Everything is based on the idea that everyone belongs to everyone else and happiness is the main priority which should be gotten right now.First of all, people are born artificially and divided into the groups. There are 5 castes in New World's society: alpha, beta, gamma, delta and epsilon. You might understand that alphas are the highest and epsilons are the lowest caste. The main beauty of that is that all society lives in peace and happiness and that is achieved by shaping mindset from the embryo. So everybody is happy at their positions and never thinks about any other opportunities. Artificial drug helps everyone always be happy despite any bad situations. There are no relationships, families or any other factors that might disturb the order. There it is vulgar and unethical to have only one partner.Such life might seem very amoral for many people, but as I said before it just seems different and unacceptable for our world. As I wrote in my previous review about 1984's, it's just a mask, matrix. Look deeper and you will see that our society is not much different. Starting from marriages, most people do that and it's almost never permanent not even including cheats on partners (I mean that cheating is end of the marriage already). Agree? You should. Furthermore, let's take castes. In our world most people think that they have a choice. The true is they don't. Yes, actually everyone has a choice, theoretically, but practically not. Just take an example of riches's children becoming rich and broke's children becoming broke. It's not because of any other conditions or circumstances, but the programming parent's give to their children. So here we have a choice, but everything starts from teacher giving right lessons to the student. So, if you have a successful mindset, you will pass it on through many generations and will get alphas. If not, you will get epsilon generations. I don't want to be mean, just trying to get your attention that everything is possible you just need to start from yourself and there is no time for laziness or any excuses. Let's take one more aspect from the book, like "I want now and here to get and be happy". What can you say about our society? It's mostly the same. Most people do something small or worthless now to satisfy some needs not thinking much about the result in the future. I hear a lot "I want this now, I need this now" and something really important and meaningful or valuable they delay for a lifetime. The typical culture of consumerism and "fast food" (fast life). And I don't mean that it's bad, I mean that everything could be used in a good way and in a bad way. You choose!One more interesting aspect for me is the governance of the society in New World. There should always be a cowboy to supervise the herd. The role of the cowboy in this book goes to world governors. There are just couple of them who supervise all the world. They are the creators of everything and the interesting part of it, that in order to become one of them you should get out of the rat race! But before that you have to realize that there is a rat race. One of them told his story, that when he realized there is more in life, had a choice to go to the island or to train and become one of the world's governors. And the island is the place for people who want to create, explore and escape from the society they are in. All of this is just one more example to see that our world is the same. Most people are so busy with their day-to-day routines that they never realize there must be more in this life. I must say WAKE UP!!!Lastly I would like to look over technologies operating in the New World. It really surprised me that the author who wrote this book in 1931 had so futuristic vision. Mass production cloning, sleep learning, flying cars, artificial drugs with no bad feeling really surprised me.So are you alpha or epsilon? But the main question in not "what" you are, it's who you are willing to become .
Excellent and involving till the end. One of the most touching books I ever read in my life. I highly recommend it to everyone and especially to everyone who gave up on their dreams. This book will show you the way to your Personal Legend!The Alchemist involved me from the start. I read this book in one sip. Really, when I started I couldn't put it away till the last page. It might look like it's a novel, but if you read between the lines, you will notice that a novel is just a surface. What is really deep in this story is the personal journey to discover yourself and reach your dreams. I love the way Paulo Coelho presented this journey. I love to dream and reach my dreams, so all the stories about somebody having big dreams and achieving them touches me, especially this one.Santiago is the main character of the story. Actually he can represent everyone on the earth who follows his own dreams. He is just a symbol of will, persistence and victory of life. The story tells his journey to discover himself. Actually, he takes the road to follow his dreams which he saw when he was sleeping. The entire journey is a metaphoric transformation to discover yourself. I don't want to tell all the story here, but can say that everyone of us has our own journey in life. The question is do we take the road? Or do we swim with the river?This book made me understand that life consists of the journey to reach the dreams. It's not the end result that makes all the sense. It's the personal journey that makes it really mater. It's the Personal Legend that you create on the way to reaching your goals. Everything in life is really just a hand length away. The question is what length journey you have to go to see those things. You have to be ready to achieve success, otherwise it will pass through. The personal journey makes you ready when it comes. And this book has everything in it what you need to be a champion in life.So, can you read between the lines? Can you see more than just a trip to Egypt? Share your thoughts .
Great book and guide on very important lessons in life. Most people struggle with their lives, jobs, relationships, happiness and so ever. I believe this book can really help most of them if they will read it sincerely for themselves and put those advises into action. The Greatness Guide is quite similar to another Sharma's book Who Will Cry When You Die. For me it wasn't much difference, but I believe that the more such books everyone will read, the more chances to live a great life he will have! Recommended to everybody searching greatness in all aspects of life .
This book is for everyone chasing their dreams. It's about amazing will, persistence, love and finally great success. Chris Gardner is the man who became millionaire from scratch. He experienced dark and cold nights, homelessness and many more struggles but finally made it to a very successful person. Here, in this book, he is sharing his experience and gives us 44 lessons in life, which can lead us to great success despite of where we are right now!It's the same author who wrote the book "The Pursuit Of Happyness". I haven't read that book, but saw the movie based on it. I believe many of you did and if not, I greatly recommend you to do so. I loved the movie, so when I saw this book I had no doubts I should read it. I wasn't wrong, this book is really impressive and it really gives you simple but very powerful lessons for life. Many people struggle in life having no clue where to start and Start Where You Are would be a great choice to start with.Chris covers everything, starting from the circumstances where everybody are at the moment then going on to the past experiences, mastery, simple everyday steps, spirituality and finally to the lessons of really happy life.Most of the lessons in similar or different words I got from other books I've read before. What I liked the most about this book is that all the necessary lessons are really clearly distinguished in one book. Everything is explained in simple words and thoughts. Moreover, this book is not about finances and money. Chris does say that money is important in life, but he talks about it just as a result of happy life. So in this book you can find everything what can be called a really happy life.Do you have any other lessons of happy life? Share with others .
Changes, changes, changes.. One of the most difficult things societies can handle. And one of the most important things in becoming successful in life as well! Most of you know people who are panicky afraid of something going even in a little different way than they are used to. Most of you know people who look with huge eyes when something changes and can't understand what to do now. Most of you are those people. And if you can't answer the question who moved your cheese, this book is really for you!Who Moved My Cheese is one of the first books I've read when I started to be interested in self-development and I'm very glad I've read it. Spencer did a great job by making this book sound as a story, really simple story that a child could read with an interest. That makes this book very easy to read and understand.The main problem discussed in the book is "changes" and how people react to it. By using four fictional characters in the story, author basically wants to show us four types of people in real life and four different reactions to the changes. After reading the material, everyone could personalize one of the characters to himself and that will show you where you are in life. Even though the story is fictional, the result in the end is real. Spencer shows real life consequences that happens to any of the characters according to their reaction and action to the changes.The book is really like a moral and I believe it's one of the most important morals in life, because I believe that based on your reaction to changes you get the certain results. On the other hand, certain results come from having a certain reaction to changes. So if you want to see what might happen to you, read this book, and it will be like a laboratory experiment looking at the mice and watching what happens to each of them based on their behavior.So, who are you in the story? Or maybe more important, who are you going to become after reading this book? Share your thoughts .
Involving till the last word. Beautifully designed dystopic world, which rises a lot of questions about human existence and purpose in this world.Big brother is watching you!"1984" is classic novel by George Orwell written in 1949. For me it was very interesting to see how author sees the future (as I know now it's the past), and as the world shown in the book is totalitarian that means no much technology or life development or improvement can be expected. The most interesting technology for me was an all seeing eye, a screen in every place, which is watching every move of every person.The book shows the world after some nuclear war. There are just three countries in that world and they are always fighting. The described country is called Oceania. Winston Smith is the main character of the story. He is working to rewrite/correct the history of the world. The past is rewritten every day, because the system (Big Brother) must be always right. The world without the past or future and without any meaning. People are doing everyday work without even realizing why they are doing that.I liked "1984" because it was involving till the end. Even though the time author wrote this novel was the time when all kind of ideological systems were developing, it's still very interesting to see one of the most ridiculous version of them. I was born in Lithuania, where we had the system of communism, but I don't remember much of that because I was too little. But after reading this book it's easier for me to understand older generation, because they were part of that system. So probably they experienced many things written in the book and the consequences of all that are still influencing their lives.On the other hand, as I was reading the book I was thinking, even if that world seems so cruel and ridiculous through my eyes, could it be that we are living in the same world right now? No, not the same from the outside world, but the same from the inner ourselves. The values of the Oceania were: war is peace, freedom is slavery and ignorance is strength. If we take the second one and try it on today's society, I could say that most people don't like to be free. They are looking forward to being enslaved in jobs they don't like and activities that doesn't make any sense also being scared to get fired, because it means that they will have to use their brains to find or start something new. The third value is also very common among nowadays society. As I wrote in my previous post, most people simply ignore the information and feel good about that. The book is very worth reading!So, do we really live in a different world? What do you think .
Genetics is nothing to blame on! If your weight shows numbers that you don't like, it's your job to reduce them. Your body is a very serious part of your life and you should treat it accordingly. Sex? Well, we all believe that we know everything, but a little more knowledge about 15 minute woman orgasm would be a great deal, don't you think so?!Timothy Ferriss is really a great author and a person who likes to analyze and experience things and later on present the conclusions to us. I haven't read his bestseller The 4-Hour Workweek yet, but when reading The 4-Hour Body you can feel that author experienced everything, what he writes about, himself. That's very interesting, because all the advices are based on experiments, experiences, tests and numbers. Timothy loves numbers and tests and I believe that's great, because most things and progresses should be measured and most of them are measured by numbers. What you need is to know what those tests and numbers mean and how to interpret them and Timothy explains everything in his book.This book is about what I would call self-performance, what includes losing fat, improving sex life, getting better sleep and seeking for other improvements in physical abilities. You should never forget that human consists of body, mind and heart (or soul) and all of these areas should be trained equally in a period of life! So this book is mostly about body, though I believe that if you are improving one area of your humanization, at certain degree the other areas are improving as well.There are many books written on dieting, exercising, building muscles, losing fat, having better sex and sleep  and so on. I believe all of them provide certain information on a subject they are written. It's not just another book on similar subjects. What I love about it the most is that Timothy tries to explain most processes happening in/to the body in an easy to understand way why you should do that. Another excellent thing is that all above mentioned topics and many more are covered in one book! Moreover, he doesn't say that you should change your personality completely to lose weight or to improve your abilities. He doesn't suggest any radical changes in your daily eating or living habits, he simply suggests what I would call an improvement. There is no easy or hard way to lose fat or improve your other body abilities. The are only few things that should be done in order to achieve your goals. And this book provides you with one of the methods. You might like it or not, but it works! Everything depends just on you. Reading the book is just 10% of the work, the rest 90% is your part in putting that knowledge in to action!I believe The 4-Hour Body will provide you with experienced information on many facilities of your physical being. It's worth reading, but just if you are going to take an action afterwards!So, do you think your body deserved at least 4 hours of excellent treatment .
Very interesting and inspiring work on governance that could be used for leadership. It's a political treatise and even though this book was written about 500 years ago, all the principles described in the book works very well these days. A very interesting look at the reasons, methods and differences of the governance is presented.Niccolo Machiavelli wrote this treatise as a gift for his those days king. The reason to do so was to explore and to describe the methods on how to govern a country. Actually everything is very easy presented. The author starts by describing differences between the counties and then gets into how and why those counties or areas should be governed. The book is full of real life examples of other nations in different times. Machiavelli describes why some of the countries or empires expanded and why some of them collapsed. Everything is easy explained and it's not difficult to notice, that most of the methods he wrote about are used by today politicians or leaders.As I've read a lot of books on leadership, this one was really interesting because of its age. Actually it might look like this book is more about management, but really there are a lot of hints and methods that turns on to leadership. Furthermore, firstly kings had to be leaders to keep the power in their hands.Moreover, what I liked more about this book, is a deeper look and understanding on how countries are created, what agreements you should make and what you shouldn't do to win. The book revealed many intrigues between kings and their relatives, which led to betrayals and deaths. To conclude everything, I think that the most important thing is not to get the power - it's to keep it for a lifetime and to be remembered as the greatest!Any thoughts? Please, share .
Is Bill Gates who he is today because of the talent he has? Was Steve Jobs such a legendary creator because of his own persistence and visions? That's a good question that Malcolm Gladwell tries to explain in this book based on the opportunities and heritage they had in life. I have a little different opinion or maybe just an addition to his opinion what I think is very important as well!Outliers is the book about success. It's not another success story or a guide how to become successful, even though, after reading such book you can know more about success than you did before. It's a book with a lot of examples and experiments that were carried out trying to identify why some people are successful and some are not. Author tries to go deep into the surroundings that famous and successful people like Bill Gates, The Beatles, Joe Flom and others had in life. Malcolm makes an assumption that no one became successful by themselves, that the heritage and the society made those people into success stories they are. The book is full of experiments and explorations deep into those people lives, which sometimes take many generations before they were born. Author also gives us many statistics, to illustrate some of the facts about successful and not so successful people.What is more different in this book, that everything is explained based on the sequence of lucky opportunities that happened to those famous people. It's like, because of that it happened this and because of this there was a good time or personal character to do something. And like I mentioned before, sometimes it goes deep into many generations before. It might be true and I can't say contrary. Anyway, author agrees that to be successful you have to have certain character features and certain time to use opportunity. That's absolutely true. It's like starting to make a wagon for horse these days is absolute insanity when we are talking about the future of flying cars. But some time ago it was a chance. The same with character, of course you need to have certain features to become successful and author mostly says about why some people have one and other people have other features based on their background and life style. And the conclusion comes that some of them become successful and some don't.Everything there is true and I believe that couple hundred years ago not everybody had so much chances to become successful as we have now. Today really everything is possible and it doesn't depend on any character or background in the end. Yes, it depends at the start point, but the beauty of this is that we can change habits and character, because we have the information that it's possible and moreover we have methods and practices how to do so. It's possible to forgive person when he doesn't know something but it's not fair to do so when he knows the information but doesn't use it. And it's a choice to use or not, but the fact that we have it still remains. So every choice has a consequences and that's also known!Another ingredient to success story in Malcolm's book is opportunity. He talks about the opportunities that those successful people had. He admits that they were ready when the opportunity came, because they made right actions before. I agree one hundred percent with him too - you have to be ready to take an opportunity when it comes to you. And again, the beautiful thing in today world is that opportunities come very often. The problem is that most people don't see them because they are not ready or are too busy with their day-to-day routine. And to be ready is a choice of how you spend you time. Everyone has 24 hours a day, so it's just a choice what will you do during that time. Moreover, today it's possible to take or create an opportunity yourself as information is very easy accessible and everybody knows it!Considering everything that was said, it's a great book, which will help you to see success stories from a different angle. I believe it will help you to see what choices and surrounding can help you reach your goals and which won't. And as I mentioned before, the beautiful thing is that you can change and adapt yourself to become who you really want to be!So what is stopping you from success? Do you see many opportunities in life? Does your character help you .
Ever wondered why some things become so popular and others, even better, just vanish? Probably everybody who has an access to the computer on this planet saw PSY video Gangnam style and wondered how it's possible that an unknown musician became so very well known and popular in all over the world so quickly? Well, me too, and after reading this Malcolm's book I've got my answers.After reading one of Malcolm's books' called Outliers I found another called The Tipping Point. I liked his first book, so I was pretty sure that this one is going to be very interesting as well. I wasn't wrong. The book is really great because of author's style and ability to put a lot of examples and experiments into the material. That's what makes his works a little different from others what I've been recently reading.The Tipping Point tries to explain why some things (products, fashions, behavior, etc.) become like viruses and spread in amazing speed and volume and why others don't. Even it might look like an accident, it's not, everything has a logical and analytically explanation. This means that everything might be planed and done in a controlled manner. The tipping point is the point, when everything changes and becomes unstoppable viral.According to Malcolm, there are three main factors that play the main role in reaching tipping point and creating a viral effect and he explains them separately in a very understandable way. Author analyzes many cases based on viral impact what leads us to more deep understanding about the cases and the factors. After reading this book it's easier to understand how many commercials are done or marketing companies work. Not all of them are doing this successfully, but some are. It's not enough to know how to do viral effect, but it's still a good start to know that it's possible to do in a controlled manner. It's not fortune anymore, it's just some methods that are already analyzed and being implemented.Moreover, this knowledge can help in a lot of good things, because sometimes bad behavior becomes viral and the only way to stop it effectively is to know how everything works. Knowing that it's possible to spread another virus, which can neutralize the first one or simply not to let bad behavior reach tipping point and become viral.I can't wait to implement The Tipping Point knowledge into my business.Any viral thoughts .
I always hear people complaining about not having enough money, about having debts and how they can't do anything because of that. I'm really sorry for those people, because the biggest debt is in their heads. And the worst is that after reading this book most of them won't change anything. So for those, don't bother, skip this review and this book. But for those, who want to see what a really top class lifestyle and business means - there are 5 billion of reasons to read this book!Donald Trump is a great man. This is not the first book of his that I've got to read. He is one of those people I really admire and I believe everyone can learn a lot from this star of success.I really loved this book. First of all, it's not a tutorial on becoming rich. There is no magic or mystic in this ability. There are just certain things that can lead you to be successful and some that will never do. You choose that! Donald is the believer of hard work. I like this point of view, because nothing comes in easy way. You should understand that while reading this book.Honestly, I didn't learn anything about success from this book. Everything Trump says about success I've already read in other books. As I mentioned before, there are certain things that bring people to the dream life. All successful people use them and talk about them in their books. Just all of them do that in their own manner and from their own point of view. What I love about Donald is his point of view, how he does that.Some people might think that Trump is always praising himself. It might seem like that, but the main thing is that when you came back to the fortune from the debt of almost 10 billion dollars, you have a right to do so. Moreover, when you are creating the top class things, it's another reason to really be proud of yourself. I bet most people who say bad things about Trump are really low class and champions of excuses.Adding more to my fascination about this book, is that I saw all the greatness of creating a world-top-class buildings and other facilities. One thing is to build a small 2 floor building, another is to build a huge and marvelous skyscraper, not even talking about the quality of living inside.In one of the chapters the author describes his work week, hour by hour. It might look stupid, but if you look deeper, you will understand how successful people live and what they do (and what don't - that's very important too!). So after reading this chapter you can compare Trump's week with your week. If you are a billionaire, I believe that it will be pretty much the same. If not? You have where to improve..So, do you choose to live a top class life .
Have you ever been cheated or tricked? Have you ever put so much trust in somebody but eventually it turned out that he/she lied to you? Do you like the feeling of being fooled? I believe you don't!This book is about lies. Before I started to read it I couldn't think that it's possible to write whole book on such topic, but I found out that there are many more books about lies. That surprised me in the beginning, but getting deeper into the pages I realized that it's really a very wide and important topic in our lives. I thought that I never lie, but it turned out that I do, just mostly all of my lies fall into the category of acceptable lies. You will find many interesting information like classification of lies and liars, the accuracy of polygraph, biggest lies in history and many more.There are things that I liked and disliked in this book. The good thing about reading Paul's book is that I really learned a lot of new things and information. Before reading it I just knew that people lie, now I know a lot more about psychology and science of lie. Yes, you can really call it science! I don't mean that I learned everything written in the book, but I can see a bigger picture on this topic now. Another thing that I liked is examples about real historical events. They really made reading more interesting. One more thing that I paid attention to is that author don't claim things, he just says his opinion, results of the experiments and facts beside. That makes it more real, than just to know someone's opinion and take it for absolute truth.What I missed in this book is more pictures of human expressions with different emotions. There are some, but I think it would be more interesting to see more emotions and more different people feeling the same emotion. Reading this book felt like it is more adapted to catch criminals lying. I've missed more examples and information on business lies.I understand, this book is dedicated to see the big image on lie topic. It's not a learning tutorial. So probably my dislikes are not very countable. Anyway, it's a great book on quite an interesting topic. If you are interested in body language, mentalism or seeking the truth, you should read this book.What's your opinion on lying .
It's sick.It's creepy.It's disgusting.It's unethical.It's psycho.It's mentally ill.It's pervert.All of these epithets might suit to describe this book. I think some people might not even read it fully.The author, Chuck Palahniuk, can really write intriguing and creepy plots for the stories. I'm not too much into novel, but as I liked "Fight Club", written by the same author, I decided to read this book as well. I can say, Chuck really surprised me with this book. I didn't expect it to be so sick. Of course it depends on the attitude, of how sick you see it, but even for me thinking to have a wide attitude, the story was pervert. And I don't mean pervert in a sexual way, I mean pervert in mind way.The story basically concentrates on few young people having everything in their lives. What I liked the most, that the author shows what is happening in their heads, but this is fully revealed only in the end of the book. One of the main quotes of the book is: "Everything we want is what we are trained to want". And only reading this book fully you can see to what sick thoughts, actions and consequences it could a damaged mind bring to.If you think you can imagine all freaky-pervert show, you should really read this one .
Simple story, simple examples and outstanding knowledge that will definitely improve your financial success and life! Rich Dad Poor Dad will uncover the non-hidden secrets of why some people are becoming rich and most are not. And the most beautiful thing is that you will be able to use that knowledge and become rich as well!Robert Kiyosaki is a wonderful adviser regarding financial issues. Rich Dad Poor Dad is his must have book in any home, because it will definitely improve your financial situation. I believe you will find many answers to the question why you are not rich yet. Robert tells his story of having 2 dads, one who was his intelligent one and the other, who was the rich one. The story starts from the childhood and I believe it's very important, because the knowledge you get being a child lasts through mostly all your life. And here comes very important question of what outcome do you wish to have in your life? This book is a great start of changing your mindset and start living a rich life!I've read this book twice and I think I will read it once a year, because even though some of the information is a little old or not as useful in different countries as it is in US, still the principles and the ideas are exactly the same. Every time reading this book I'm getting a little bit different understanding of what Robert wants to tell us, so I believe reading it once a year will still give me a very valuable new insights.What I love about this book is that it really explains differences between people's mindsets and how those mindsets are affecting their financial life. Mostly if the financial situation is bad, that leads to all other aspects of life to be bad. So by reading this book you will be able to understand the main principles why some people are rich and most are not. Another great thing is that Kiyosaki advocates education a lot. And by saying education he means not the education system, but the education itself, what means constant improvement of you. He really doesn't like the system that is used in many countries to produce just employees, without any knowledge of financial issues and any chance of becoming really rich! And yes, many people are still blindly following the habit, that you need to go to school an get a good education. It's time to wake up, because we are living in different times!And some WARNING at the end: This book won't make you rich - you will! This book will just give you the knowledge how to do that!So, are you ready to wake up, or you need to get your diploma first .
I wish I have read this book 10 or even 5 years earlier. Principles told in this book is taken from long time ago and they still have a big value on these days. Now I can see exactly why i didn't make or had money at some times in my life, I think you will see too.The Richest Man in Babylon is written in a story telling style, that makes this book very easy to read and very easy to understand. In my mind some principles told shouldn't be taken straight, some of them you should adapt to nowadays. World seems to change, but the rules of money making and having still are the same.I encourage you to read this book, practice principles and I believe your finances will get much much better .
I'm so glad I got to read this book. It's absolutely amazing and mind-blowing masterpiece. I admire Randy very much and I admire him even more and more by reading more of his books or any other stuff. I can say it's absolutely must read for every human on this earth and will tell you why.This book hit on me from the very start and I have to admit that I started to write this review even though I haven't finished the book yet. That is because I really want to share my excitement about this book with you. Don't worry I will finish this review only after I will finish the book. There is not much left. The message Randy shares with us is very controversial and eye-opening. Many of you might be shocked and don't agree with the author, but that doesn't change the reality Randy want to show us. The question is why you're dumb, sick and broke? The answer lies in those pages. Everything depends on how you are going to use the information. I found this information extremely priceless and it really helped me to understand why certain things are happening in my life. Knowing this I can act and change things I don't like to create my dream future. I believe you can do the same.One part of this book tells you why most people are not happy with their lives, yet another explains what should you do or don't to fix the situation. That is the beautiful part of it. There are certain laws of wealth and prosperity that you will find in this book. Using them you have a chance to create your desire life. I loved those examples Randy gives in his book, I really love the way he does that, because every example is quite controversial and that forces you to think, and I believe this is one of the reasons this book was written. One of my favorite parts was a imaginable story about new settlers on an island after the plane crash. By reading that story you can exactly see why people are acting in a certain way in this world and what is more important is that you can make a choice, how you want to act in your own life.I can't share all my excitement about this book in this short review, because I would just have to rewrite all of it. That's not my purpose. I just can assure you that this book is one of my most valuable books ever read.Why you have to read this book? The answer is simple: because nobody want to be dumb, sick or broke. And if you struggle in any or all of these ares it might be a sigh that you don't know or understand something. And if you are good in all of those ares this book will help you to strengthen you position and belief. So there are no any excuses why you shouldn't read it, except you have already done that .
I love you.I am sorry.Please forgive me.Thank you.That's all you need to attract wealth, health and peace of your mind.These four simple sentences make it all. This entire book is rotating around them and the main idea is to reach the level of zero limits, which means you can do everything at that point. The book describes Hawaiian belief system called Ho'oponopono, which is kind of religion, just don't have any gods. It's the system of cleaning yourself from any kind of bad thoughts, habits, actions and so on. Even if it looks simple, it's not so simple to use it properly. The first thing you have to do is to take all responsibility for anything coming into your life for yourself. Only by taking it, you have a change to get results practicing this system.The book is written by the man very well-known from the movie "The Secret" - Joe Vitale. Author describes his experience about getting to know this mysterious method. The book is based on his relationship with Dr Hew Len, the expert of this system.Personally, my first reaction after starting to read this book was really strange. I couldn't understand much that was written in the beginning and it seemed that it's just a nice story, like a novel. I even started to think to quit on reading this book, what I never do. The first thing that caught my attention and kept me on reading was when I read that Ho'oponopono is a Hawaiian system. I love Hawaii, so I decided to keep on reading till the end. Page after page and I really got involved in the book. I started to analyze and think that it might be true, even if it looks mysterious and too simple to be true.I'm not practicing this method intensively now, still I think about it quite often and sometimes try Ho'oponopono system. It's strange, but I think it's working, just I think I need more time to experience the results. Another thing that I started to love is Ho'oponopono music. First times listening it might seem strange, but latter it brings peace to your mind.If you love Hawaii or searching something different in your life I believe you should read Zero Limits. It's one of the philosophies of this beautiful island .
Dale Carnegie - the master of success! This book is one of his most popular books which had really changed many lives. One of the most important skills to reach your goals is probably communication and Carnegie beautifully reveals the secrets of this great skill. If you read this book and implement it, I believe your life will change to a great adventure!I've read this book twice and going to read it couple more times in the future. It's a book about one of the key skills in becoming successful. Human communication plays a main role in every situation including relationships, business, making friends, learning, creating and probably all other spheres of life. So mastering such a skill is extremely important in life and this book can teach you to do so.I love this book because everything is very easy presented and explained based on examples of real life people. Those secrets seem to be not secrets at all. All of you know them and might be using some of them sometimes not even realizing that if mastered and used properly it could change your life for better forever. You don't need to learn nothing new, everything what you need is to read this book carefully and implement those lessons step by step until it will become your second nature.I recommend this book for everybody despite who you are or how many and how good friends do you have. If you already mastered necessary skills of communication, it will be just a check that you are already a master of communication. But if not, you will discover a new life.Tell me your new life story after reading this book! Or maybe you have any other great suggestion .
Most people wonder why certain people are successful and others are not, even though all of them are trying hard. I bet you wondered that many times as well? There is no any magic or mystery! There are certain habits that successful and effective people have and others don't. And you are able to know all of them in this one amazing book.This book was released 25 year ago and I can't believe that so many people still don't know those essential 7 habits of effectiveness and success. Anyway, it's still very great to have such book at home where you can find very valuable information about how to become highly effective in your life. And I believe many people seek that knowledge, but many might not know where to get the correct one. This book will uncover 7 essential habits for every one of you to become highly effective and successful!I've read this book twice and am really impressed with the information Stephen presents us. He believes that to become highly effective person in life you need to master 7 habits. Habits - because everything we are used to do is a habit, but not all our habits help us in life. In the beginning the author describes what a habit is and why it is important to develop them if you want to have a meaningful and successful life. That means that if you have some useless habits you will have to change them to useful ones if you want to live a better life.Latter on Covey tells what those 7 habits are. He explains what it means to be dependent, independent and what it means to be interdependent and which habit makes you reach those levels. I was really amazed by the simplicity of the information. It's very easy to start using it in everyday life, still to master those 7 habits you will need efforts, but there is only one way to become effective and successful in life.I highly recommend you to read this book if you are not as effective and successful as you want to be. Even if you think that you are successful enough I believe this book will help you to reach even higher. After reading The 7 Habits Of Highly Effective People you will see which areas needs to be improved and there are other great literature on improving any of those fields and then everything is up to you!Do you have any other advises for the effectiveness .
This book will take you on a very unusual journey through the mind of one of the most important people on human psychology in history - father of analytical psychology Carl Gustav Jung.The book that is not easy to read even though it supposed to be an autobiography. And it is, just most of the times it looks like an unusual biography and seems like it was written about the life within the author's mind. This book is my first meeting with C. G. Jung and I should admit that there were parts where I didn't understand exactly what he had in mind. Probably I will have to read it once more in a few years after I'll read more of his works. But I liked it, because it portrays very interesting personality, who spend all his life studying human psychology and basically creating most of today well know psychology works and practices. I am very interested in psychology and it's always very interesting to know the basics.What is interesting in this book, that you can be acquainted with both parts of Jung's life - his life events and his inner life, his mind and thoughts. Both parts are very interesting - his childhood, early years, school, studies, work as a psychiatrist, relationships, trips and so on. Another part is more difficult and as I mentioned above it's not so easy to perceive. Jung talks about his dreams, visions, reflections, that sometimes really seem very crazy. That's why this personality is so interesting to me.I believe you should be ready to read this book and probably you will have to read it couple of times in couple of year's period. If you are interested in human psychology, behavior and philosophical personalities, I believe you will like this book as well.I will finish my review with one of Jung's thoughts that caught my eye in the end: &#34;We become lonely not when we don't have close people, but when we can't share things with them that seems important to us or when we hold on the attitude that is not acceptable to others&#34 .
Find answers to some of the most interesting and important questions of how human mind works! Discover reasonable explanations to the most mystical and magical things like paranormal faculties, hypnosis, telepathic, voodoo, auras, shamans, miracles and many more.I should admit that Mind Dynamics was one of the most interesting books I've recently read. This book really gave me a lot of information on many things that are called mystical or miraculous in our society. I got many answers and still many more questions left for the future studies and readings. This book covers many such topics, but basically it's about our brain and how it works. Moreover, and what is very important, it's about how we can use that knowledge about our mind to improve our abilities and lives!Some things in our society are taken for granted and some are considered as mystics or miracles. That is just a lack of information and in most cases just a lack of knowledge, which is actually already researched at some levels and could be available for everyone. Author really made a great work on researching many of the information on such topics as voodoo, shamanism, hypnosis, self-hypnosis, suggestions, consciousness, faith, healing, miracles, autosuggestion, brain waves and many more similar phenomenons. I personally believe that all mystical phenomenons can be explained in a rational way and this book gave me very valuable information that I am not wrong.Another great thing is that this book is full of explanations and guidelines about using many techniques and methods in order to establish or improve our abilities that will definitely influence our lives. Christian gives detailed information about how to use them correctly. That is a great thing, because this book can be used practically as well.Compared to other books on human mind, Mind Dynamics is really very informative, practical, quite technical, and well historically researched. It will give you scientific explanations to many unusual phenomenons and most important it will help you to understand how and why your own mind works. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to know more about their own brain, who wants to improve their abilities and mostly for those who still believe in crystal ball.Do you believe in what you see or do you see what you believe in .
Richard Branson - one of the most brilliant entrepreneurs in today world. He managed to create very successful businesses in many areas like music, airways, space trips, trains, mobile operators and many more by establishing Virgin company. Starting as a publisher of a student newspaper and becoming multi-billionaire. Richard is one of my most inspiring personalities and this book is exactly what you need to start making your dreams come true.Screw It, Let's Do It covers everything you need to make successful business and enjoy the processes all the way. I've read almost all of Richard's books and even though I didn't get any more knowledge of his life journey in this book, it's still a very good reading to summarize everything I've read in his previous books. It's short, it's simple, it's interesting to read and it has everything you need to start dream building and believing in your even the most crazy ideas.The book is called under the most favorite Richard's expression and it represents the action mode. One of the things that brought Branson to billionaires is action, and Screw It, Let's Do It explains it all. I remember times in my life when I was delaying things and that didn't bring anything good. If I have told myself &#34;Screw it, let's do it&#34; I believe many things would have turned out much better. Richard doesn't say that uncalculated risk is a good thing, but he says that if the risk is measured the the action should be brought in immediately. And he proves that by his achievements!What do you think? Do you delay things and regret about it later .
One of 2 my favorite movies. One of movies' classics masterpieces! I can still remember watching this movie almost 20 years ago, when it appeared on a big screens. Since then I watched Braveheart more than 10 times and every time watching I still get the same feeling as it was the first time. What made me such a huge impression? The simple answer would be - everything. The movie is really done brilliantly. Having in mind that it is almost 20 years old and it's impossible to compare it to today movies, but still this movie can compete with majority of the movies being made today. My second favorite movie is Avatar and I can say that Braveheart is the Avatar in those days.The story line is quite simple, but the implementation of it is astonishing. Mel Gibson did a great job combining all the components together to make Braveheart. The movie has everything: romance, freedom, fight, betrayal, love, will, persistence, idea, legacy and many more elements of life. It's impossible to describe this movie in any review. The only way to understand it is to watch it yourself. I believe, that there won't be anybody left with no feeling after this movie .
How good can you accomplish a task assigned to you? Ever wondered why some people simply get things done and the majority are just making themselves busy by looking for reasons not to do something? I'm sure you can find many answers to those questions by reading this short story!A Message To Garcia is a very short story written more than 100 years ago. The main purpose of it is to make you understand why there are so little people on this earth who can really accomplish the task. Most people can start or do something in some manner, but just the very few can really be trusted to finish the job without looking for excuses. The most beautiful thing about it is that everyone can choose by themselves to be that person. You don't need any native born skills or features. Actually you don't need anything extraordinary, just the right attitude which you choose by yourself! This book doesn't teach you anything, it just tries to make you think and choose your attitude.The story is relevant these days probably even more than it was 100 years ago, when it was written. Most people say that they want to get something first and only then they will do their best. I don't believe them. I saw many people, who get what they've asked for, but never do their best and probably never will. I believe that if you do your best, you will always be rewarded and I've proved that many times in my life.One of my principles in life is always to do my best whatever I do, and if I don't want or don't feel like doing my best, then I just quit that activity as fast as I can and start something where I can do my best. By reading this short story I realized that this principle was always very important despite the century people are living in. I really recommend you to read this book, not because you will be able to understand why so many people can't be trusted on tasks, but to change your own attitude and get things done immediately!Can you deliver a message to Garcia? Or will you just start questioning: why? who? where .
Apes are holding Einsteins by the ropes in both fighting sides. The same apes are trying to create a new society after the nuclear war. The same apes are living by the fictitious savage dogmas. No questioning, just a blind belief in what is created to be an absolute true. How much human is left there in the society?Aldous Huxley is really very talented philosophical writer. Ape And Essence is his second book I've read after Brave New World. As I've expected, this book made a huge impression on me. I admire author's ability to create great stories and show the world in the most deep philosophical way. I like this book very much, because it reminds us what it means to be human. Author beautifully paints world based on created norms that nobody knows where they came from but takes it as an absolute true.This time Huxley takes us to the future after the nuclear world war. From the surface this book looks different from Brave New World, but actually it's the same insane life, where nobody is really living their own life. It shows us empty post-apocalyptic world where only few survivors are left and are trying to create society again. Everything is told through the eyes of the scientist who came from New Zealand, the only country which was not touched by the war.Interesting fact is that author takes a scientist who looks like he is still living in our known today world and puts him in the conditions of the future post-apocalyptic world, where people are building a society on savage totalitarian and religious fundamentals. And that looks so unacceptable and inappropriate through his eyes, as well as through the readers' eyes. But if you look more deeper, you might see that the world we are living today is not much different, most people are so used to the dogmas, values, routines and imposed norms that most just take them as an absolute true even though sometimes they feel that it doesn't have any meaning to them and just makes them live by the inertia. And here the question rises, is the imagination of the Huxley just a fantasy, or is it a reality just made up with a different make-up?Another interesting thing that I've noticed while reading this book is that those people used books just as firewood to cook and satisfy similar needs. This is not the first book where I've noticed such behavior with books. The misuse of the books was pictured in Brave New World and in Orwell's 1984 as well. I believe these authors want to show that reading books is one of the greatest ways to grow in life and nobody from those stories was interested in this fact. It's sad, but even in our world most people don't use their reading abilities at all, they just forget that and I believe it's equal to using the books as firewood.So how much ape do you have inside you .
Do you know math? Languages? Geography? Chemistry or any other science? Have you ever studied in school, college or university? Did you have lessons of getting rich science? No? Well, this book might be one of the most important in your life!The Science Of Getting Rich is one of the root books, which established the principles, that all other self-help, getting rich, success or self-development books used later on and are still using these days. I've read many books on this topic and I really admire this book, because it's short, everything is concentrated and presented beautifully simple. Don't take me wrong, many books teach us how to do certain things in the best way. They are very important if you want to be successful in the sphere you are in. This book is about the concept of what you need to become rich and successful in life and these principles can be implemented in whatever you do. Though, you will still need the certain knowledge about the thing you are doing in life.I've read this book couple of times. It was one of the first books, which I've read more than a year ago. I've read a lot of other books before I came back to this book again. Very powerful, I can say that everything in The Science Of Getting Rich is very potent! The book is involving and addictive from the very beginning. First chapter - The Right TO Be Rich. Strait away the author talks about human nature right to be rich and to have the things that make life to be fulfilling. I believe many people might judge him because of his point of view, but as he says himself, it's just the excuses for laziness.If you are struggling or looking for something in life, I greatly recommend you this book, I believe you will have a clue where to start!So, do you have an excuse for not being rich .
Hi guys, I am Aistis and was following Randy Gage for some time. I got a chance (thank you Randy) to read his new book, which is coming on 30th of October, beforeit is released. I was shocked, amazed and fascinated of the vision Randy shares with us. This book is much different from many success literature, it is something different I even expected from Randy. The main message Randy wants to share in this book is to cause us to think. In this book he does not tell us anything what or how to think, by telling all those thing he just causes us to think. And in my mind that is the reason this book is a must read for everybody who can read letters!!!Risky is the new safe sound really strange for many people, it simply denies everything we were taught to know. But it is TRUE. World have changed and rules of life have changed and now no lifestyle is safe until it is RISKY. Life tempo is getting faster and faster and many people never stop to see what is coming and what are those changes bringing them - problems or opportunities. And in my opinion this is one of the reasons why you guys should really get a copy of this book for yourself and for ones you love. For some of you it will be shocking and mindblowing. Others will find the answers to their questions like I did. Some of you guys will get a million dollar idea. I believe there will be ones that will throw this book in the corner after reading. I think every choice is acceptable, but give yourself a chance to see the world upside down.Prepare to get a lot of information that is unusual to you. You will choose to believe it or not, to admit it or resist. The fact is many things will happen despite of our will and our role is to see an opportunity in whatever is happening!!!I would like to share with you my favourite Randy's message: "You must be willing to let go of who you are to become who you are meant to be", - Randy GageEnjoy your reading guys .
Ever noticed that sitting in the seat in the bus which takes you to work and doing this same exercise for 10 years doesn't give you that feeling of what you really wish to do in life? Being an excellent accountant at a big company and making a lot of money doesn't bring you joy? Always wanted travel the world but are stuck in a well paid job that doesn't give you this luxury?You are missing your WHAT!!!But there is an excellent solution to this..The book I've been looking for some time. And you know why? Because I believe that everything in life starts from finding your purpose, your WHAT, your passion engine that really drives you. I've read couple of great books that can help you to find your WHAT, but this one I like particularly because all this book is about it. Steve Olsher is a brilliant author who dedicated all the book to help you find your WHAT, make sure of it and use it to create life you desire.What I like a lot about this book is that everything is distinguished in very understandable order. Moreover, the book encourages you to act right now by having all those exercises that helps in finding your WHAT and using it. That is very important for me, because it really makes you use the knowledge you get. The book is like a guide to your real potential. Of course it will help only under the condition that you will be accurately doing all the exercises. I already have my WHAT, but still it was very worth to do the exercises to check on them.All the examples presented at the end of each chapter are really inspiring and instructive. You can discover a lot of inspiring and brilliant personalities and you can use their knowledge and work to improve yourself even more. Reading this book is not the end, it's just a beginning of your real life's journey. So, make yourself a favor and take time to yourself, discover your WHAT, learn to use it, develop the talents needed and live the life when holidays never end!Looking forward to hear your story of WHAT .
Ever wanted a Ferrari? This book will help you get one, later on, it's your choice what to do with it!Robin Sharma shares his advises again. This book is a sequential book to the precursor The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari. I can't say that it's better or worse than the first book, because it's quite different. Different in style, not in the primary meaning. This book is not written in a story style, it's more step by step tutorial  and all advises are distinguished and explained one by one. And because of this style, I believe that this book is very clearly and easy understandable. Stories are important as well and they help us to realize things easier, but after stories it's always a good thing to have a step by step guide, which will remind us the most important lessons.What I liked in this book is that author really emphasizes that money is not a bad thing and it helps you reach your dreams easier. I believe this is very important, because as I mentioned after reading The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari, some people might get an idea that you don't need money in life. And that's not correct. So in this book author explicitly mentions that money is important, just you don't need to make everything only about money.I really encourage you to grab this book, read it and try it! That's very important, because sometimes we have the knowledge, but the only way to benefit from that is to put it in action!Waiting for your thoughts, share your experience while reading this book .
Atheistic look to the human being. The author, Julien Offray de La Mettrie, explores the theory of human flash and soul being indivisible and basically operating as a machine. Following that, all human behavior and existence is explained on the basis of physics and chemistry.A book written more than 260 years ago. Sincerely, it was one of the most difficult books to read even it's quite short. I can't say that I liked it and can't say that I didn't. It is just a lot different from all the other literature I've been reading so far. Still I'm very glad I read this book. It showed me more how people were thinking and creating different ideas and theories about human existence hundreds of years ago. Actually it is interesting that the author had so much courage to publish such a work back in those days. Nowadays religion is not as strong as it was 260 years ago and the book is very against the dogmas of church.I really like authors thought that the human is what he eats. I think it is a lot true, because what you eat defines how you feel, and how you feel most likely to define how you act what leads to what results you get in life. This entire journey is most likely to show who you are.Do you have any thoughts? Share your opinion .
Astonishing, breath-taking, mind-blowing story about the orphan who changed the world. I have to admit that this book was one of the thickest books I've ever read in my life. And in addition to that it was one of the most stunning book's I've ever read in my life.This book is biography of one of the most brilliant minds ever lived on earth. He is Steve Jobs. Everyone knows iPhone, iPad, iPod and many other devices created by Apple Inc. So in this book you can find all the life story of the man who played the main role in creating and developing those amazing technologies and the company itself. And this story isn't simple.I love this book because it's so involving and inspiring. I couldn't put it down since I first took it in my hands. Of course, I haven't read this book in one sip, but until I was finished I could think only about what's next. Another thing that fascinates me a lot, is that in this book there are a lot of dreams, struggles, challenges and victories. Jobs himself was a very difficult, but interesting personality. Some people hate him, some love, some do both, but there is none who don't have any of these feelings for him. His vision was huge, his dreams were unrealistic. Despite all of that, he made everything to make them come true.I greatly encourage you to read this book. If you have big dreams, huge visions, wish to succeed - Steve Jobs biography is a must read for you .
Change your mindset, change your life. Change your living place, change your..hmm..My interpretation of this story!Russell Conwell wrote this book/story more than 100 years ago. It's one of the stories that started a self-help era of literature. The book was born after many lectures told by the author himself. The story is short and the main idea is that if you want to be happy and successful you should look for that where you are. Russell talks mostly about people or emigrants who leaves their home and searches for the happiness somewhere else.I've read this book twice, but still can't understand it exactly. I have just my own interpretation. I don't think that you should understand everything word by word, it might be dangerous. I am cosmopolitan myself, and I look at the whole world as my home. Not the country, not the city. Maybe times changed and the world became smaller (in the meaning that today we can reach any corner of the world in some hours or talk to a person anywhere in some seconds), but I personally don't believe that we should stick to the place we were born at. I believe we have a choice where to be and where to live despite of the fact where we were born. I agree with the author on the idea that it's possible to be happy and make a success in any place where you are and you don't need to look for that somewhere else, but sometimes you just want to experience the world and find some other place to live and to be happier.My interpretation is that acres of diamonds is your mind and your mindset. I think that you should change it first to be happy and successful, because if you just change the place and your mindset will stay the same, nothing really good will happen in your life. You must look into your acres of diamonds first to find the treasures held in you. Of course, changes in life, living place, country or other circumstances sometimes help you to change your mindset easier and to discover you acres of diamonds, but still it's the first thing you should deal with. And this book is one of those which will help you to change your mindset!Do you have any other interpretation of this story .
How much do you like yourself? Do you like what you do? How you look like? How you live? Are you the person you are wishing to be? Is your life going in the best way that could be for you? If not, then who is responsible for your life? The answer is simple - YOU ARE!As A Man Thinketh will make you rethink your life. It's a book about any human's view to life. What/Who is creating you? Is there any circumstance which makes your life as it is, or is that you - yourself? Although many people are thinking that their life is based on many different circumstances, it's not true. You are the only one who creates those circumstances around you. The simple answer is that there are actions and there are outcomes. Certain actions create certain results in your life and those actions begin with your thoughts. The circumstances just make your actions sharper.I agree with the author for one hundred percent. We are what we are thinking every day, what is deep in our hearts. One of the sayings is that &#34;Money spoils people&#34;. It's not true. Money just makes people to be more visual for who they really are. If person is good in his heart and thoughts, no money will make him evil, but if he is not, everything will make him bad.The good news is that we can change everything with no additional circumstances or features. We can change our lives just by starting to think in a different direction. It will require will, persistence and patience, but that's the only way to do that. If you are happy with your life, great! If not, if there is anything that you are not happy about in your life, you will need the advises from this book. Don't wait, any hesitation will have certain results and probably you won't be happy about them.Are you creating yourself that you admire and are proud of .
You have to serve for the people - people who buy your products, people who work with you, people who you work for. Howard Behar is the man who made Starbucks the biggest coffee shops network in the world and now he shares his knowledge and experience with us.There is nothing much new or different from any other business success literature in this book. Howard shares his life journey while developing Starbucks into the biggest coffee chain in the world. He shares ten principles, which made his fortune. All those principles are pretty much the same as many successful people have. What I found different in this book is that Howard writes it from the perspective of people. Mostly he concentrates on all the people who make the business like customers, colleagues and employees. Author points out how important it is to listen to people around and act on other people's needs.It's Not About the Coffee made me to start looking more deep into people, analyze what they want and find a way to help them in what they need. It was a good reminder of the success principles as well, and mostly it helped me to realize how important people around you are. The book showed me that it's people who do the business. It's important to have a good product, but it's also very important to have and develop good team .
Even though I admire Richard Branson very much, after reading this book I admire this person even more. Great man who changes the world and great book that can change your mindset and attitude towards the world. Richard is one of my teachers (through the books), and he really makes a big difference in my mind when reading all the experience this great man can provide me with. I believe, he can be a leader for many of you too!I love the way Richard Branson looks to the world and to the businesses. He is really very inspiring personality, who really has a lot of influence to my life. Business Striped Bare is not the first Richard's book I've got to read, I read almost all of his books and even had a chance to meet him. Since I've started to be interested in Richard my hunger to meet him started to grow. Now I have another dream, and it is to start some great project (business) with this amazing person and work with him together.This book really blew my mind. It's full of priceless advises which comes from experience of creating one of the biggest brands in the world - Virgin. It really opened my eyes to see more global things and to think more global. The book is distinguished into couple big chapters where Richard explains the most important parts of the business like right people, brand, trust and commitments, failures and learning from them, innovations, leadership and social responsibility. This last chapter really got my attention. I really love how Richard looks to the world from social spectrum. Even though some people might not agree with me, but this man is really changing the world into the better place. All the projects he describes in the book are really of great value (and I don't mean value in money). All the innovations Richard is trying to develop are so amazing that it really will change the face of the world in couple of years. That's where my mind stops to look at small things and tries to see big opportunities and really valuable (not just in money) things. We all can do something but after reading and understanding some of Richard's thoughts it becomes so strange to care about just any worthless thing.One of the things that really inspired me a lot was the board of old and very respectable people from the entire world. For those who have never heard of this, it's a group of people who meet to discuss the global problems of the world and none of them is politician or has any other interest except really big experience in life and a wish to make world a better place. This really made me to dream one day to be one of those people.Considering all above I can say that Business Striped Bare is a very strong book. I really recommend it to everyone who really are in business and want their business to grow big. Richard managed to create such an amazing empire and he really has so many advises which could be used to be successful. Epilogue of this book is even stronger and for the end of this review I would like to share one quote: "It's possible to choose different ways in this life, and it's extremely important to choose the right one. And like it's not enough, it's not good choice to choose nothing, because such attitude to life really ensures failure".So, tell me, what way in life do you choose .
Have you ever thought that in order to stay healthy one of the choices might be to avoid doctors and drugs as much as possible? Sounds strange, but it might be a solution! Heath is a sensitive topic and ask yourself honestly, how much do you know about it (I mean know, not imagine or have somebody else's opinion as yours)? Do you think that the goal of pharmacy industry is to help people? As a business owner I will tell you that the main goal of business is profit. Everything else might be just the second!Health is one of the most serious issues to many people. Doctors, hospitals, drugs and other health related things are very important in life for most people. The main question is how much do we really know about this sphere? And how much do we trust authorities that are in this field? Most people don't pay too much attention to their health until something goes wrong with them. And after this happens most people simply blindly trust any kind of doctor thinking that he knows what is the best for them. It might be true that most doctors should know more about health than we do, but there comes another very important question - if they are trusted so much to know what's better for us, might there be a manipulation of that knowledge? It's a very serious question that most people never ask themselves.This book is written by a man who spent many years working for the pharmacy companies and his claim is that most of those companies simply work for profits and do many evil things to achieve it. He describes his experience of doing unmoral things himself. Of course, most facts still can't be approved by the certain evidences and sometimes this story even might sound like one of conspiracy theories, but still it raises many serious questions.You might read this book and take everything as an absolute true or you can read it and take it as an absolute nonsense. It's your choice and you will have certain outcomes by making your decision. Or it is possible to read this book and make a critical thinking of what might be true and why it might be true. I personally take the information in the book more as true than as nonsense. The reason for that is that everything what I see around is more likely to claim the story than to deny it.One of the chapters is about artificially made diseases. It's not about creating physical viruses (I believe that is possible as well), it's more about creating what I call mind viruses. It's when you put a fear into society's minds about some illness and suddenly you come up with the cure for that. In such case most people get sick (mentally) and buy cure even they have never needed that if they've never knew that. And this is one of those things that I really see around by myself. Even this makes the information in the book consider more correct that incorrect. You should be blind if you don't see all those ads on TV, streets, screens of various drugs. I don't need them, but most people simply do, because they see and believe. Another question that I ask myself is what is the pharmacy industry really capable of? And what is it is just showing us?Your thoughts. Are you sick just because there is a cure for your illness .
Still interested in utopia worlds? Then this book is for you. For me? No, thank you. Utopia books make me wanna shout "wake up"!The more I read about utopia societies, the more I love this world and the more it seems to be the best world to live in. Just finished reading the book The City Of The Sun by Tommaso Campanella and it really seems like a copy of Utopia by Thomas More, which I read couple months ago. The style of writing and the way author express himself through the material is very interesting considering the century it was written. Though, Tommaso was absolutely familiar with the More's treatise Utopia, and the style of both books is similar not accidentally. Sincerely, I like the "original" Utopia more.If you still don't consider our world to be utopia and still dreaming about living in those fiction utopias it's a great book for you to read. What really made me think reading this book is that Tommaso builds his City of the Sun on the society he actually lived in. It seems that utopia is just what actually exists but everything that is considered bad is removed and everything considered good is magnified. That's it, nothing more nothing less. Moreover, the religion is exaggerated what is strange having in mind modern utopias that really denies religion. But having in mind the century the book was written (more than 400 year ago), probably it's the norm.In addition, The City Of The Sun really look like a mix of the modern days authors' books' The New Brave World and 1984. Not considering technologies, just taking the society's lifestyle and traditions, it really looks having characteristics similar to both of the modern novels. And still I don't love the robotized society. Even though the book describes happy people, I still don't see any personalities and any sense of their existence, but probably that's the point of utopia world.I just want to make some analogues to our world. One of them is that society in the book is so busy doing everyday activities that people don't even have time to realize themselves and their actual needs or existence. They are blindly following the order of the state, the formed needs and formed happiness. Sadly, but our world is the same. Most people are so busy doing everyday routine activities, following formed opinions and needs that are basically not their own. It seems the same robotic. The good thing is that in our world we can wake up, we have everything we need to do so and if utopia dreams doesn't make you more robotic, if you feel somehow that you need to escape from sleeping life, one of the best books to read is Why You're Dumb, Sick and Broke...And How To get Smart, Healthy and Rich by Randy Gage.If you have some additions or different opinion, please, share and discuss it together .
Old idea and old book, even though, the ideas are still very alive these days. One of the most influencing humanism works written 500 years ago by Thomas More. I like the book but I miss the point of creating utopia world. What about you?Interesting thing but the word "utopia" came from this book as we know it now. Thomas created it in this book by describing in his mind the ideal society, ideal place and ideal life. Utopia is written in a story style and that makes it very easy to read and understand. Recently I've read some other books describing opposite to utopia, which is called anti-utopia. It was very interesting to see the differences between all of them.Utopia is a fictitious place and the author describes it as an ideal place for society to live. Based on fictitious story teller he describes many different aspects of life like cities, authorities, crafts, communication, relationships, trips, slaves, war and belief. What I didn't like is that through my eyes many things are based on Christianity or has some color of it. That makes me to think that basically this utopia society is based on emotional and not reasonable aspects.Me personally I'm not admiring the idea of utopia. I think it has many disadvantages. What caught my eye is that in this book there is not mentioned some really important aspects like passion (in any ways like sexual, activity and even life). Sometimes this book reminded me Brave New World. It's similar that in utopia nobody possess nothing and in Brave New World everyone else belongs to everyone else. It doesn't really much differ in mindset, just in surface. What I really doesn't admire in utopias is that they deny personality and destroys character only leaving human as a small part of society. It seems that you can change any two people with places and nothing will change or have any difference. It's possible that in many cases the same would happen in our world, but here at least we have a chance. Actually I think utopia might be more admired by those, who want somebody else to do more for their good.Most utopias tries to make people equal, but it's not right, because happiness is not equal and it can't be. Everyone's happiness is different that means you can't give everyone the same things and expect that they will react the same, because people should want different things in life. People shouldn't be computers programmed by the same program. I think that we are living in quite an utopia world. Everyone who is not programmed by memes (or even is) has different wishes and understands happiness differently. And the most beautiful thing is that everything is possible in our world nowadays. Everything except what your mind limits you from.So, isn't this an utopia world? What do you think .
Today is science fiction of yesterday and tomorrow is science fiction of today.Hot air balloons, zeppelins, bird-men, first attempts to fly, parachutes, first planes, first airlines, spaceships, trips to the space, future of air travelling and much much more you will be able to know going through the pages of Reach For The Skies.Reach For The Skies is a beautifully written history of the evolution of the men's attempts, fails and successes to conquer the skies. The author of the book is my favorite billionaire Sir Richard Branson. As he loves to fly himself, it is very interesting to see this history of the airship through his eyes. I really enjoyed finding out how all that what we now have in air traffic was developed. Branson presents the facts in a very nice way where you can see people's visions, attempts, persistence, fails, successes and finally where all that led to.Not much time have passed since first attempts to fly were made. It's only a little more than two hundred years since first hot air balloon lifted from the ground and now we already have spaceships, which can fly to other planets. The same is with the travelling speed. It changed dramatically in just a couple of decades. Everything developed so fast, that it's hard to imagine where we are going to be in another one hundred years. Branson himself established the company called Virgin Galactic, which can take you to the space and everybody can become an astronaut. It's already possible!It's also a huge opportunity for new businesses. It might be difficult for many of you to see it in a business way, but some people are already doing it. As I mentioned before one of them is Richard Branson. Moreover, space hotel is being made for those who want to spend some time watching the earth from the skies. Many other opportunities are opening and author gives us a look through all the history to the future. One more interesting fact I found out in this book was that the first airlines were established even before first airplanes were really made to fly. That's the vision! Now is the next step. All of that you will be able to read in Reach For The Skies.So where is your ceiling? The Moon? The Mars? or maybe something much bigger .
The book written by Sir Richard Branson himself. It's not his first book which I had a chance to read. Yet Losing My Virginity is one of the best books I've read in my life so far. Richard is one of my inspiring personalities and probably that's why for me this book is even more special. I believe, everyone, who has big dreams and want them to come true should read about how virginity is really lost.Losing My Virginity title was chosen not accidentally. One of the reasons was to make a catchy title for the book, to attract more attention and in my opinion it played out very well. Another reason is that the empire created by Richard is called Virgin. To sum up all that, this book is very worth reading, and it's not the title that makes it unforgettable - it's the real story, that makes this book epic!And the story begins with Richard's childhood. If you think that rich people are born, you are wrong. Author himself wasn't born with a silver spoon in his mouth. He had to earn everything himself and that journey wasn't simple. Getting into those pages you will find how Richard started, developed, almost collapsed couple of times, struggled, fought and finally made the impossible.What I love the most is the story itself. For me it was inspiring, motivating and forcing to think big. Never stay satisfied only with small things and always keep looking for the things that truly matter. I admire Richard's attitude to life. He was always trying to have fun in business, always prove that everything is possible, and when you read this book it seems that the word "impossible" simply don't exist in the dictionary.I like that Richard is really open in this book. He wrote not only about business but also about his love adventures, women and sex. Moreover, this story reveals fights for the true, reputation and honor. It's so involving that I couldn't put it away until I knew the end.I believe, everybody will find a lot of priceless advises, ideas and courage in this book. If you'll read it with an open mind, I believe the word "impossible" will start to disappear from your life!So what is your story of losing your virginity .
I am following Big Al for already about 2 years. I also had a chance to be in life event where he was one of the speakers. Since then I like this person a lot, because of his charisma and funny way to present the information. Getting to read this book was really a pleasure for me. I read it in one sip, because of the same easy and not boring style that Big Al has.I can proudly recommend this book to all people developing network marketing business in any range. It's very easy to read and to understand the material. Big Al knows how to make things simpler and easier and I believe that most people involved in network marketing can learn many thing from this man. The next step after reading this book is to implement the information presented in it. And that's way more easier when using the stories method explained in the book.I was having different struggles building my business and still have some.

I recommend this book to everyone in network marketing, moreover I believe that this book can be used even by many people who are not in such business, because leaders are the main players in any kind of businesses and spheres of life .
I usually don't read books like this and that's probably the reason why I gave it just 3 stars. I usually look something that I could take for myself from the book. I don't want to say that there is nothing to take from this book, but it's not much. For me this story is more like romance and struggle in love story than a story of human transformation and finding something meaningful in life. It's a classic story of bad boy and innocent girl who finally find each other and the bad boy changes to good side. Many movies are made on this topic and many books are written as well. I usually look for more meaningful lessons or stories in the books.Reading this book it usually seemed that I'm reading some Gothic theme literature, more likely to be some vampire story. It's too much darkness in this book. I understand that it's a novel and it's creative work, but I'm looking from the perspective of what I can learn from this book. And as I mentioned above it's too much to read all this book, just to understand that you are the only one to fight your darkness within.I could recommend this book for people who like dramatic love stories, vampire love stories or similar - you might find it interesting, but as a literature of human transformation and lessons in life, sorry, there are much better books on that purpose .
Magic, mystery, illusion, tension, love and a beautiful story line make this movie really worth watching! I watched this film some time ago, but still can remember as one of the most interesting movies. Probably one of the things that made me love this film is the idea about mystery or in other words about illusionist. That kind of thing always was interesting to me. Moreover, this movie kept the tension and intrigue till the end. The most interesting part was that the main trick, the main illusion was going in a different way that a spectator could think of. I don't want to uncover the plot here, because it will be more interesting to watch it for yourself. I greatly recommend The Illusionist for everyone who likes mysteries and tangled plots .
Jim Carrey is really a great actor. I personally admire him more in comedies, but this movie proved that he could play any role in acting. I saw The Number 23 couple of times. It made me a big impression then I saw this film the first time, because I didn't know anything what was going to happen and the most interesting thing is that the movie kept the tension all the time till the end. Even in the end of the movie, when everything became more clear, there raised a new question - &#34;why&#34;, which kept the tension even more longer.The idea of this movie is mystical. The name of the film tells us a small hint - number 23. Everything what happens in this movie is connected to this number and the main character (Jim Carrey) gets obsessed with this thing. His obsession evolves to actions what finally ends in a very unexpected way.I was trying to look at this situation logically. From the experience I've got and the books I've read I know that everything is possible to explain in reasonable way. One of the facts is that we see what we want to see and where we concentrate our attention. Moreover, it depends on what is usually going on in our heads. After watching this movie, couple next days I saw number 23 couple of times. I payed attention to that, that's why I saw it. I didn't count the times I saw other numbers those days and that doesn't mean that number 23 was following me.Wish you a great watching! If you like mystics, this movie is exactly for you .
There are a lot of games and toys in this world, but Cashflow is one of the most intelligent game of them all. By playing this game you can get a lot of financial knowledge that was skipped in your standard education. I enjoy playing this game every time, because it's a great way to spend time with friends not just having fun, but learning new and very valuable skills and knowledge as well. I recommend this game to everyone, because it's a must when it comes to everyone's finances .
One of the greatest movies I've ever seen! Why? Because this movie has everything what you need for a spectacular view. Actors are not superstars, but it's the least important aspect in movie if you have everything else in it's places. The acting is great, special effects are superb, filming and directing has nothing more to add to. The story line is not new or something what you have never heard before in different interpretations. What I love is that even the story is simple, but the presentation and implementation of it is made the best way I could imagine!James Cameron is the director of this movie, and what I love about him is that he has an incredible ability to make masterpieces while many other directors can just make something. One of the most admirable things is that this movie, Avatar, changed the course of movies industry. James Cameron showed everyone that movies can be watched in 3D. He didn't invented 3D technology and I know that. Steve Jobs didn't invented many things too. What makes these 2 men similar and what makes me admire them and their works is the ability to make great masterpieces and change the course of history!I greatly recommend this movie to everyone .
Sometimes it seems that your life is a mess? Or maybe it's more often than just sometimes.. There could be some reasons for that and I believe that some of them could be solved by reading and implementing the principles which are found in The Four Agreements.I didn't read this book, I listened to the audio version of it and I think there is no difference while you are getting the wisdom being presented to you. I listened to it maybe five times and going to do it many more times. That's one of the advantages while driving the car: you can use your time wisely and get some self-development happening!I should admit that some similar information I've got earlier from other books. What I love the most about audio version of this book is that information is presented in a story telling manner what makes it very interesting to listen. This book made me look to everything in my life from another angle. The author presents four simple, but very powerful agreements that can really change your life. I'm still practicing to get used to those principles. Even it's simple to understand, it's more difficult to implement. On the other hand, the examples make it all easier.Have you ever thought about human domestication? Well, if you never did, than after listening/reading The Four Agreements you will understand that we are not any different than any other living beings on this planet. And we are domesticated to be humans, so it might be that most of us really don't even know what it really means to be a human. We are humans just the way we are taught to be humans.Back to four agreements, you will be surprised how obvious they can be. Most of them you are using everyday, unfortunately mostly in a wrong manner. I don't want to write them here, because just writing them without explanation would be meaningless. I greatly recommend this book to everyone who wants more balance, peace and freedom in their life. I believe this book will cause you to think if you are prepared to look at everything what you've been taught from another angle.Does domestication program that you've got help you in your life .
Very good science fiction movie, with beautiful effects and great acting! Of course, many scenes were made with a lot of help of computer and graphics, but that's the beauty of using the technology to create something great. I personally expected some more deep story line. For me it was similar like The Matrix. Just in The Matrix human's don't even realize there was a war and in Oblivion they believe they have won the war but they have to leave..One of the things that really mesmerised me was the house where the main characters were living. Amazing house with even more amazing pool. I wish to have such living place for myself:)This movie raised me a question about what we believe to be true. Do we really know that something is true or we are just taking the things other people or authorities are telling us and considering them to be true? As you'll see in the movie, there is no true, there is just a created reality we are living in. Even though the scenes in the movie are science fictional, the concept of human life is a reality which is happening around you every day just in different forms .
One of those movies that make you feel so small in this world. If you like special effects, it's a film for you. This movie is packed with them and great fighting scenes of huge monsters and robots. I didn't give it 5 stars, because it's not one of those movies you could watch over and over again. As I mentioned it has a beautiful special effects, but the story line is not very strong. The idea is simple, somebody attacks the Earth and people start to fight for themselves. It's just a standard hero movie with great development and implementation of special effects .
I always was a fan of X-Men movies and Wolverine is my favorite character there, so I was very excited to watch this movie. Great fighting scenes, great acting and directing of the movie made it really very involving and interesting till the end. Moreover the end was really unexpected, it seemed that already everything is obvious, but it wasn't. Special effects are always a necessary part of X-Men movies and this time they are not the exception - they were great! Impatiently waiting for the next part .
Steve Jobs is my favorite personality. I was very excited when I found out that there is going to be a movie about him. Of course, I read the book about Steve some time ago before the movie was released. So, after reading the book firstly, the movie didn't make me a big impression. I was absolutely obsessed by the book and compared to this, the movie was just OK. I admit, that Kutcher's acting and directing of the movie is great, but the story itself is missing the thrill which you get from the book. When I was reading the book, sometimes I got the shiver by reading things described in the book (mostly the achievements of Steve). I didn't feel anything similar in the movie.I don't want to say, that the movie is not worth watching. Yes it is. But just one time. If you haven't read the book yet, then I greatly recommend you to watch the movie first and read the book afterward. If you are choosing between the book and the movie - choose book. You will never regret .
Stunning views and huge money thriller. Ben Affleck and Justin Timberlake did a great job. Both characters are very well fitted into the movie. I liked Runner Runner from the start till the end, because it's easy watching movie with a lot of amazing views, luxury things, big dreams, great lifestyle and involving plot. This movie has a little everything, like drama, romance, action, fun, betrayal, crime and thriller. Such movies help me to dream build, because that's why I like them. I believe you won't be disappointed after watching this movie.What can you learn from this movie? It's that everybody has a weakness. Find it and you will own the deal! It's very important in life, because everyday we are making some kind of business or negotiations. Another thing that can be learnt from this movie is to dream big and play big. Of course, the bigger the dream, the bigger the risk, but there is no other way. I'm not talking about gambling or other games. I'm talking about any kind of dreams that you might have .
Good reading about starting and developing business. I think this book really can serve you as a guide if you want to start your own business but don't know where and how to start. It covers important aspects like targeting your group, getting traffic, gathering information, selling, upselling and what it is very important - loving and relating to your customers. Daryl also talks about the importance of complains and how to handle them. What I really got from this book is that being the best in you sphere is not everything, being the best for your customers is everything.It's simple, easy readable and understandable and if you want to start you own business it's an excellent guide to use .
Stress is a usual thing in our lives. Some kind of it might be good and some very bad. It's important to know when stress can help you to progress and when it can harm you.If you don't know anything about stress this book will give you the basic knowledge of what it is. It's like a simple tutorial or an info brochure on this topic, but not a book. What I didn't like about it is that there is not much information on the ways to reduce stress. As the topic says this book should help you to reduce stress and for me it seems that it just gives some information on how to do that. I expect more deep analysis and information from such book.The good thing is that it's short and if you don't know anything about stress you can read this info in one hour. On the other hand, you can find all this info and more in Wikipedia of simply internet, using search keywords &#34;ways to reduce stress&#34;.Wish you a healthy life without stress .
One of the things in life I really value it's my TIME and this movie really wasted it! Of course, the acting is great, because of the talent and skills actors put in this movie. It's their job, so it is obvious that they do their best in whatever movie it might be. Why I didn't like this movie? Because it's nothing new, funny, worth telling others or worth using any lessons from the movie. The story line is very weak and worthless. On the other hand I should admit that directing of the movie is not bad, it's very good. My judgement of this movie is not based on the movie itself. I always like to see something valuable in the movie apart the movie creation itself. There was a time in my life when I was watching a lot of movies and then I decided that it's enough to waste my time watching other people's lives. For me it's not enough just to watch the movie, I want to take something away for myself. And The Family falls to that category of movies, which is well build, but it's just pictures with no lasting value .
The information presented in this writing is useful and I believe many people starting network marketing business could find something that could help them to start business better. What I didn't like about this is calling it a book. For me it's more like a blog post or a information brochure, but definitely not a book. I missed explanations, more analysis and advises. More examples would helped as well .
they broke way to easy and i can truthfully say it was not my fault they broke, they just wanted to .
I have an older kindle and love to play games. this game is a lot of fun!! I can't wait to try all the others I downloaded today .
I absolutely love this agenda. It is super pretty and it has plenty of space to write. It is a perfect size, not too big not too small, and I love how the front and back flaps have a fold which allows you to store/bookmark pages.I didn't give it 5 stars because it would be better if it had a full month view at the beginning of each month and the material of which its made of can cause the ink to smear depending on what type of pen you use .
I work 12+ hrs a day with 4 computer monitors so these glasses where definitely a must have. They definitely help with the glare and at the end of the day I don't have a headache or feel that my eyes are burning! The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because they tend to get really dirty and the cloth they come with doesn't really clean them well .
they cut really well! highly recommended! Cut Schnauzer's hair and poodles with knotty hair that nothing else can get through .
defective product which made a huge mess after installed. After installed, turned water on and it blew the handle off all the way to the ceiling, made my husband fall, soaked the walls, ceiling, runied stuff in my bathroom including my expensive blow dryer which got soaked inside so can no longer be used. We needed the faucet replaced for my son's 1st birthday party tomorrow and now the guest have no bathroom to wash their hands in. It's cheaply made and the part the bolt to the handle screws into is made of plastic and is stripped which is what caused the handle to blow off with such force. We got soaked in just seconds. I want a refund .
Terrible do not like it at all BAD NEWS FOR YOUR PLAYING DID NOT ENJOY AT ALL BAD BAD BORING  ;- .
Not a fun game Disappointed is an understatement. ICK made many purchases not happy with any of them  at all .
Enjoyed very much. The instructions were easy to understand  and fun to play.  But I did not like some of the choices .
This  game was a disappointment for me. It was not as I expected.  This game was slow and difficult to play and understand .
Do not like this game at all.  I had to give 1 star and actually I'd give it MINUS 1. Can I get a credit refund .
Don't like this game at all.  Have not been satisfied with recent orders. I think I'm going to stop ordering. :- .
Don't like this game. It is so similar to others I ordered and disappointedi in all of them. Will not purchase anymore I believe .
This model doesn't have the PS button on it so it makes it hard to use, and is impossible to use as the only controller as the PS button is heavily used. If only needing it as a secondary controller, it should work well enough .
Does its job really well and doesn't clutter up a USB port doing it. Stays strongly secured in the back of the case, so not really a worry of bumping it .
Great fit anyone that loves the stig, however the ones on the poster are not in the show. They are still really funny though .
Slim, nice throw, looks very clean. I don't like that the playback controls are function keys but I've gotten used to it .
It could use a stronger hanger and a better way to hold the hanger in place. If you have very heavy jewelry or a ton of it, might not be a good choice .
If you love family guy, and/or Brian you will love this little guy. Cute and cheap and doesn't take up too much space .
Fits the phone perfectly, and protects it very well. The only thing I wish was better was the covering of the top and bottom of the phone, they are left exposed so potential to get dinged if not careful .
It doesn't have extra bulk, looks good so it can fit with any set up, and does its job perfectly .
Winslow Homer's famous painting, Snap the Whip, portrays boys playing a game that was popular with kids over 100 years ago. In this book for kids Gatsby the cat has the magical ability to jump into paintings at night. But if he doesn't get back into his own world before dawn, the art will be changed and that's what happens in Snap the Whip. Gatsby tries several times to return into the painting and correct the changes that happened because of his visits, but keeps being delayed by his adventures until it's too late.The author, Barbara Cairns, does a wonderful job of getting kids interested in this famous work of art and young readers from seven to twelve years old will enjoy the book. There's interesting information about the Winslow Homer that can be used in school reports at the end.The illustrations by Eugene Ruble add to the charm and will encourage younger kids to enjoy hearing the story read aloud.I have a feeling Gatsby's Grand Adventures is only the first book about this magical cat .
The colors we received are the same as shown above. They seem to be decent quality. My 5 year old is a little tall for her age and weighs about 57 pounds. She usually wears size 7 so I got medium thinking they would be a tad big so she could wear them a little longer. She won't be able to wear these for probably another year because the neckline droops down past her chest. The bottom goes down a little past her belt line, so it's not too long or too short. They fit very loosely around her body. I would definitely buy these again, only a size smaller .
The colors I received are as shown above. The material is very thin, which is what I expected. I wear a size 9 1/2 in women's shoes and they stretch well to fit me. I'm not sure if these will last too long due to the thin material but they are comfortable .
I bought these for my 9 year old boy. He wears size 3 shoes. These socks fit him extremely well and he says they are comfortable. They are not too tight or too lose....perfect. The material is pretty thick and I assume will last a while. I will definitely buy these again .
I got these for my 5 year old girls. They are both in shoe size 1 1/2. The material is not too thin or too thick. I believe they will hold up for a while. My girls say they are comfortable and the fit is great. I would recommend these .
I would definitely recommend this! The hay was fresh and it's a great deal. This will last my guinea pig a while. Be prepared....the hay was not separated or baled inside the box, but it was not strung out everywhere either. It was placed fairly neatly. I received the box before the estimated arrival date .
Scanner works great! But when I entered codes from three different vehicles into the DTC definitions; came back &#34;no codes found&#34;. I googled the codes and had no problems .
I was shocked as to how fast the document arrived. It was at my front door in less than twenty four hours. And it was packaged perfectly. I have ordered documents before , and none arrived as fast  and in such perfect condition. I was very impressed .
Bought as a gift for a little boy for Christmas. He loved it!! It works great, no problems at all .
Got this case before I realized that it doesn't fit the Kindle Fire. Very disappointed about that. Shipped from Hong Kong, so not gonna return. I'm sure it's a great little case for the tablet it's supposed to fit .
Ordered these before I read the description that they don't work with the Kindle Fire. They work great with my mother in law's phone though .
Love it very nice product but now have to figure out how I can change the battery in it no instruction  with  it .
The rear window visibility of my smart fortwo convertible was a bit claustrophobic. I looked into a lot of aftermarket backup camera solutions and stumbled upon this. Buying the 11&#34; x 14&#34; size, I cut it in half horizontally, flipped the top half upside down and stuck it to the bottom of the back window. It now completely obsoletes both side mirrors; it is dramatically wider in both directions and leaving virtually no blind spot. The fortwo is the perfect car for this product because the rear window has very little slant and no ass-end sticking out, so there is neither distortion nor obstruction. Because I left a gap in the top of the window, I can still tell when a car is very close to me.Twelve bucks and no hassle, you can't go wrong with this.I'm also recommending it for the hospital I work at, it makes it much easier for staff to check on patients. Doors with a 1'x1' view port can have this stuck to it and you can see everyone in the room at a glance .
The previous reviewer didn't understand how this device is used. Though, I can't fault him too bad since it doesn't come with instructions. You are supposed to completely unscrew the top-cap bolt, and underneath is a larger bolt that expands the inner plug. Once you have the inner plug pressing against the inside diameter of the steerer tube, you can screw the top-cap in to actually preload the headset tension.On a metal steerer tube, you can then remove the whole thing if you wish, to save weight. On a carbon steerer, it is recommended to leave it in, so that you have something to counter the crushing force of the stem.Anyway, $8 shipped for a reusable plug that can set any material stem is definitely worth 5 stars .
thought the stones were beautiful but dissappointed in the looks of the band , looks like cheap plastic no i would not recommend this to anyone i know .
The right arm broke off within 20 minutes of having them.  I was not rough with them and they were not dropped.  The arm just.... Literally fell off.  So frustrating to pay over 100 dollars for these cheap china-made pieces of crap, wait for so long to get them, then they fall apart within 20 minutes when I'm going on vacation the next day.  Might as well get a five dollar pair from the gas station, they last longer.  I'd give it zero stars if I could .
don't know why it charge like over 10 hours..hard to see green light for couple of hours... it's way too much more time consuming than phone charging itself... so disappointed .
15.6' laptop is fit perfectly but the space and heigh is not good enough to carry more than 3 or 4 books.looks cute but somehow it looks like parachute bag which I feel the lack of small room tho .
Bought this 2 months ago and now shopping for a Britax.  Thought the seat was an answer to future needs but WRONG.  Too hard to tighten the straps, difficult to latch and unlatch the crotch strap, straps twist, tether strap doesn't stay tight, not as comfortable for child as reviewed to be.  Have said nothing to her about her new car seat but she(petite 5)has expressed, "I don't like this seat much except for my little treasure places."Graco Nautilus 3-in-1 Car Seat, Matrix .
Awesome book can't wait to read the next installment! The main characters are great! She's a good writer I hope she keeps this up .
Best Book Ever, great book. It would be good for teens or teens. I could not stop reading  because I love it .
Waste of money! Do not purchase this!! The stickers aren't even sticky, after applying the stickers they all fell off of the wall within 10  minutes. I asked for a replacement but was denied. Very unhappy customer .
I was skeptical of this product because it was so cheap. But i have seen an improvement on my acne scars. However, i haven't been usin git multiple times a day everday as it reccomends .
I bought this gun because I had never seen a revolver air soft gun. Its very cheap but the quality of  the gun is worth a lot more. The aim is a little off. you have to aim a couple inches down. But Its a $50 gun, can't be perfect. I love and am buying another for my brother .
This shampoo works great. My dog is whits, so she gets dirty really fast. this shampoo gets her nice and clean. She doesn't have that wet god smell after words. The vanilla smell doesn't really last after the rinse, but it does smell good .
First make up I have used that does not cause me acne problems. Love this make! Looks and feels natural .
I had to purchase a remote for 40$ along with this holiday bundle. The xbox description said nothing about it. I thought that was weird. However it was a gift for a nephew out of state, so I had to purchase the remote so he had something to play with the xbox. Basically, I wasted money on buying a remote when the bundle came with one. The xbox worked great though. Nephew was very happy .
Thought this was a great action packed read.from start to finish it told the story of father and son and its bond even if they don't agree with each other .
This case is awesome,the wake and sleep function work perfect.case is sturdy and doesn't feel cheap at all.it arrived in only three days way before the estimated time.buy this if you want a lot of bang for your buck.you won't be disappointed .
Pretty classic game ,still a great way to pass some time..if you place first you shouldn't loose your coins.change this and would almost be perfect .
I did not get the cases that show on here. Instead I got thin cases that do not protect my phone at all. I'm usually happy with my orders but this one I was not happy about at all because of the fact that I got totally different cases then I expected .
really enjoying the karaoke machine.  Like the 'authenticity' of this machine and the kids really feel like they're singing into a real mic! Sound is good although volume can't be turned up very high b/c of feedback .
very nice, sturdy units that can be arranged in a number of ways to fit your storage needs.  This looks great on our washer/dryer and it looks so tidy and organized in there now!  Not too hard to put together. Only problem is we were sent smaller sections that I think were supposed to be for the backs, but were too small to fit .
We have 3 girls in one bedroom and affording 3 matching bedding sets can be a daunting financial task!  However, these were extremely reasonable, and look very cute in the girls room.  No problems with them although they are not the very highest quality.  They are really great for the price .
We were very impressed at the quality of this bedding.  It's heavy enough to keep you wam, but light enough not to suffocate you and cause you to overheat at night.  The pattern is gorgeous and the quality unsurpassed.  Great price too.  We are very satisfied .
What a great way to look at words in a whole new way. Makes you realize how just one letter can change everything. This is a clever way to review clues and truly engage your brain. If you are up for the challenge, this is for you! You won't be disappointed .
Twisting the barrel to turn off is too easy to go even farther and place it in the &#34;remove battery&#34; position.  Not a critical failure but annoying.Does not pull hairs and is comfortable.In order to remove from package I recommend: plasma cutter, crowbar, and a circular saw .
Menu selection is not intuitive.  Display is hard to see.For this price download device should be included.  That ability would increase functionality.Chest strap should have on off switch so you don't have to detach battery after each use.  This would mean one less thing to lose .
No complaints after six months.Purely personal preference:  when stop watch function is no longer needed, I wish the next function would revert to time keeping mode.And since I use this for flying, I really appreciate large numerals in vibration prone environment .
The crate itself is made well, they just designed it poorly.  The clips that hold everything together in alignment are all placed incorrectly.  They could go an inch either way and hit nothing, but they seem to have been placed right in line with cross members of the wire frame on the front panel and properly placed on the rear panel.  So, they hit the wires and distort the front door so badly that it's a pain to open and close.  I would not buy one again without trying it out in person to ensure everything aligns properly.  Who knows what it is that creates the inconsistency (new welder, bad machine alignment, poor quality reviewer), or whether it's just a problem with my unit, but it's maddening .
I remember really liking this movie when it first came out and I thought I'd buy it and see what I thought of it now...I'm not the least bit disappointed .
Recent and cool movies.Like the resume feature.Also the buy or rent (pricing)feature is a plus.Have not used the search yet .
I used a similar purse storage unit for for two years. I put this unit up & put the same purses (V Bradley) not heavy purses in it and the next morning it was on the floor. The plastic that holds the straps broke on one side & the strap itself gave way on the other side .
Its an enjoyable read. I liked the cutaway views and history. Though the Gulf War was pretty much one sided when it came down, I still found it informative on the mindset U.S. tank crews had on the Iraqi armored forces, and was surprised on how little training the Iraqis received, that its no wonder the Coalition won .
I really want to give this five stars, I really do. It installed well on my computer, but I need a license key number to play the game. I searched the package, case, and cd, but found no license key number. I couldn't play the game .
Bought mine 8 months ago and is now shot! No help from Netgear at all!!!! It is now New Years eve and I have to go to the store and get a new one. Screw you netgear .
Daughter is 2 1/2 yrs old and it came natural on driving it. She has hrs of play time with it.  Its great.  I have no complaints on this .
When i got this item in the mail i opened it and i put my device in it and i saw that it was cracked and the case would not close. I do not like this product i think it is a waiste of money. Don't get it .
When i got this product i was trying some of them to charge my device and all of a sudden the orange one did not work so i hope u can work on this product .
I really liked this book I could not stop reading when I finished a chapter I cold not help myself but read the next one and the one after and the one after that is how good this book is it is the best mermaid book that I will ever come across its five stars for me .

I have used it for 3 weeks. Although I did not check my weight, my belly is obviously smaller than before.It really boost up energy. And the good thing is I do not notice any side effects which is rare for fat burn products .
Cutter works great, but the  saw not so good. Overall It performed very well. I would recommend this tree pruner .
I have now been using the Haan SI-70 for about 6 months.  I love it. It meets my expectations.  I bought it after reviewing and reading reviews on a number of machines. Consumer Reports had listed an earlier version as their top pick but mentioned several negative issues such as a weak handle.  As soon as I put this machine together, it was as though they had read the same article and gone back to the drawing board and made the necessary corrections.  The only issue that will never be solved is having a long enough cord.  Really not an issue of importance to me and easily resolved with a longer extension cord or a smaller house.1. I would recommend using mineral free water just as you should in your cloths iron.2. Try following the directions.  The directions are important.  Don't, for example, place the pad on the machine as it warms up. They give you a rubber pad to place the machine on as it warms up. You are not trying to work with a wet pad but a pad though which the steam can flow. It is all in the directions and my wife has proven that that does not necessarily mean people follow them.3.  There is a learning curve with this and any other steamer.  It feels as though you are moving a lot more slowly which is true. I followed the directions and take about a four foot square and slowly move the steamer over a path once, move over and go over a second area and then pass over the 1st area a second time.  That removes the tough dirt. The key is not to rush and change the pads when they get wet. Again, it is all in their directions. Ultimately, I find this considerably faster and more satisfying than mopping in the traditional manner.4.  I believe that rugs should be vacuumed first and then again after use of the steamer, again in the directions.  Remember, it kills the mites and bacteria that live in your rugs.5.  I also found that being able to remove the steamer and use it on my bedding  worked great. It is not a fast process but once a month is not that bad. Again, dust mites and bacteria can be destroyed.6.  For the price, the Haan is a great purchase .
I have used Pinnacle for years and found it very user friendly.  Now they come out with Studio 16 Ultimate. It is a miserable excuse for a home editing program.  I render the film and export it only to have it freeze and say it has experienced a problem or it keeps exporting but a large X appears and continues through the rest of the movie.  I have found no way of working around these issues.  I went to their site as suggested in a blog and downloaded any updates suggested and was seriously optimistic.  Great, now instead of the X appearing, the program simply freezes and reports the "experience problem."  I even went so far as to cut out the offending segment, eliminated any transitions, titles, etc. but the program simply freezes in a new spot.If you think that this product is supported, forget it. You can pay some wizard for help or drink magic kool aid.  You cannot even figure out their manual which is about as large War and Peace but it does not seem to be of any value either .
Holds my Harley Road King no problem! Loading my bike in my pickup is easy because you ride up and into the Condor stand and step off the bike. Tying down is so much easier this way with the bike standing straight up! Also in the garage the bike takes up less space in the Condor than on the kickstand. Love it .
Got a Droid RazrM and an Otter Box for it. Phone fits without the protective case but with the Otter Box, no way will it fit.However, I put my camera in it and it stays on the tank no problem at 65 mph .
It's not fitting as I expected.Skirt is too flare.The top is too big.It's for different type of body .
Absolutely brilliant. Nothing more. Nothing less. Exact words,written as if extracted from my subconscious "darkness" ....I loved this book. Obviously .
Recently, specifically bought this grinder as it was non-aluminum and certainly not cheap plastic. Never owned a grinder longer than a week, always broke down herbs by hand. A cheap basterd, im very picky when it comes to buying things I really don't 'need' must have great reviews or I wont touch it. I consider myself an average partaker, 6-10 sessions a day, in short order, this grinder is well worth every penny. Grinds herbs to a perfect size, pollen trap works great, easy assembly, good weight. Only flaw of this grinder... the magnet holding the top to the grinder is not very powerful, tip it sideways or upside down & the magnet will fail. Hold upright. Wash metal shavings out .
Die hard westwood studios fan. EA butchered C&C do NOT buy this. Get it for free someplace if you can but do not waste money on this horsemanure .
It is exactly what it says it is. These silver pieces are very very small, about the size of a dime. They weigh 3.1 grams... which is totally not worth the price one must pay to get one. They are cute however and great gift for young collectors .
Great mouse for web browsing, not too fond of side scrolling mouse features. Great for most internet and pc gaming, any other general laptop tasks. I have small hands, this works great for me. Only major flaw, after a couple months of use... the scroll wheel becomes loose. Doesn't really affect anything unless you like to rest your finger there (gaming) then it tends to wobble up and down. Great scroll capabilities, dont really need a mousepad for it. Minimal crevices for gunk to get into. Reciever neatly tucks into battery compartment .
Beware of other daisy screens which feature a stem, the stem tends to get in the way of the bowl hole if you will. These screens did not have a stem and worked great for my use. Usage 8-14 sessions a day .
They work great but beware that there are 2 (two) different styles of glass 'daisy' screens. One just looks like a daisy, without a stem if you will. The other has a looks like a daisy with a stem. I currently have both styles on accident. I find the screens without the stem fair better than the others. The stem seems to block the pipe hole, not really useful to me .
Beautiful mint state 1964 Washington quarter with great detail, can even read print in the reflection of the coin. Minor defects, nicks, or dents but still a fantastic coin .
Great book! I recommend this! At first it's a little weird. But DONT STOP READING!! it gets better .
Mrs. Whitten read The Phantom Tollbooth to my fifth grade class about forty years ago.  I moved before hearing the ending.  The only thing I remembered from the story was the Island of Conclusion.  At the time, I didn't know what "jumping to conclusion" meant, but it got stuck in my memory.The Phantom Tollbooth is as fun to read at fifty years of age as it was to hear it read to me in the fifth grade.  I can appreciate it's educational value now which was lost on me as a child.  The story is a light and easy read with not so subtle reference to numbers, letters, time, character building, and more .
This is a good book for me personally. It helped answer a lot of questions i had and couldn't make since of. It is a very good resource for someone like me who is new to the craft. I really enjoyed this book .
This is actually a very good book. I originally bought his thinking it was about the elementals of the watchtowers...it is not. so i was disappointed. but i did read it and has been put to use more then some of my other books. I would recommend for beginners..since this book talks about the elements of earth,fire,water,air...(not elementals .
This has a great aroma to it. Very calming and is a great product. I buy all my E.Os from here. (So far.. no problems) . If you have a very hyperactive child like I do .. BUY THIS NOW. It true is a life saver. Calmed my son within 15 mins it was amazing .
This works really well and it does exactly what it says it will do. Just don't put it on quick , you need to take your time otherwise it will look really sloppy and there will be bubbles from dust particles .
I like this case and it works great BUT i am giving this a 4 star because on my sleep/lock button it doesn't fit right. apparently the 4s is a little bigger than the 4 and i have the 4s. it will probably fit perfectly with an iphone 4 .
this case is sooo cute! i love it so much. if you like protecting cases though, this isn't for you. i gave it a four star because when i got it the lace was already kind of peeling off. it will be fine though because i will just switch it out alot so i have it longer .
I would recommend this book to any level of a triathlete. Seasoned veteran or beginner. Chrissie is such a tough competitor but absolutely loves what she does and doesn't forget that! Which some of us forget! Truly a great book .
The oil helps keep everything working smoothly. Haven't had any issues with anything sticking. Would recommend this to other people .
Cuts my husbands hair great! I'm no hair dresser but its easy to use and my husband even has cut his own hair .
Our son loves this clock. Had an issue with our son waking up around 5-5:30 in the morning and we were hoping this would help him realize 6 was a more reasonable time and ever since we got this clock he hasn't tried to get up before 6 .
Crayons didn't stay in the little casing the whole time and was hard to keep the crayons in there especially with a 1 year old pulling out the crayons but worked beautifully on the mat .
I like the color blue, but the color is not same in the photoit is beatiful and practice.  Good .
Too many table runs cheated out of! Its obvious that the game is designed to let both players shoot 99% of games. The computer would change how far balls would roll and leave you hooked 1-2 balls before the 8 ball. I used a clear ruler to extend my guidelines to the center of pockets and object ball would hit down on rail and then rattle pocket. I understand its supposed to be fun but very unrealistic. Ive been shooting pool everyday for 25 years and I can assure you I don't have to always power the cue ball to draw it back. Also, the way the english works on the game is in no way shape or form realistic. I played to level 18 then uninstalled the game. Just because people are level 78 didnt mean they should be given a chance to shoot because I was a lower level. In real life most people don't get to shoot if I pocket a ball on the break. Someone with some knowledge of the game should have designed it .
way overpriced if you want a fire that cost 13.00 just throw your money in the fire place no way .
The black portion does come off fairly easily when the case is not on the phone, but when it is on the phone the two components of the case fit together quite nicely. It's a slim case with good protection capability .
I reread these books all the time. They are my childhood. I have no other words except amazing. I strongly suggest everybody to read them .
I hate this monitor, wish I would have never wasted $200 on it. My first problem with it is that it times out every 15 minutes. why in the world would you have a baby monitor time out, the point of the monitor is to watch your baby ALL night, how on earth do you expect me to watch over my baby if im constantly having to log in, so I had to buy a second monitor TOTAL WASTE. my second problem is if you try to log back in too fast it doesn't work you have to go completely out of the ap and start over. I wouldnt recommend this monitor to anyone and have already warned multiple people not to waste their money .
My 4 year old daughter saw this castle in the store and wanted it so badly. She absolutely loves Sofia. But upon reading these reviews I am extremely disappointed and will not be purchasing this for her. Something made by a brand as big as Mattel and for the amount of money this item costs you'd think that it would be better build. Made with stronger materials. A huge waste of money to anyone who buys this and disappointment to the children that want it or already have it .
Mattress is a little expensive to me, so I decided to buy a sleeping bag instead. This bag is amazing! Big enough, with high quality. There is no reason to refuse it .
they were a little pricy but thats because they are surgical steel  haven't put em in yet but i am excited .
when I first started taking this it seemed to be working pretty well. I lost 5 pounds in about 2weeks, but I also eat very healthy and I work out almost daily.  So that  didn't exactly send me to the moon or anything but it was definitely encouraging. I started out taking the 3pills a day like it says, and I got SEVERLY constipated. So I cut back to one a day and slowly worked my way back up. The consipation comes and goes now but its There more often than not. I've been taking this product now for almost a month and not only have I not lost an ounce, I gained back the 5 pounds that I lost. It doesn't seem to be doing anything at all at this point. Which is dissapointing because I have struggled with my weight for so long even though I eat right and exercise so I thought this could be the answer I was searching for but sadly, i have found that the old saying holds true, if it sounds to good to be true, it probably is. I will continue to take the pills until they are gone just in case I suppose but overall I'm not really pleased. Especially for the .
Grim story like the book.  I enjoyed the film very much.  Peter Jackson and the rest of the production crew did a fine job again.  Can't wait to see the death of smug .
I went to a flea market on South Water Street in Providence this past weekend and purchased a bar of Lavender goats milk soap from Legend's Creek Farm. As soon as I picked it up I could tell it was going to make your skin feel so smooth! I could not wait to use it- It is absolutely amazing. Your skin feels smooth for a while and it makes you smell great! I also loved how it had bits and pieces in it that's good for exfoliating! One more thing- I didn't realize the farm was located in Foster, I live in Glocester and finding local products is the best feeling in the world. I highly recommend these products .
I'm not totally sure what I was expecting but very quickly found the story to be uninventive and extremely predictable which made it very boring .
I think it's funny that there are so many negative reactions to the ending; it is really the only way that the series could end.  Both books in the beginning of the trilogy lead up to exactly what happened (to a point of being predictable), and anything other than Tris sacrificing herself as she did would have been out of character.  The book was well done in that it answered a lot of questions, and showed us some insight into Tobias which was interesting.  Good book, not as bad as people are making it seem in the comments/reviews.  It is written for it's target audience (YA), and it stays true to character .
I love this game. The only thing I would ask the makers to change is to make it so youre able to start a new game. I've deleted and downloaded it 3 times already (only had to pay once) just so I could play again once I finished it. If the makers are reading this please make an update that allows you to play again so that I so that I don't have to keep deleting and redownloading .
The game is great! But too short at the end it states the second will be out at the end of 2013 well it's almost March2014 and its not out yet! Where's number 2 .
I ordered my textbook online through Amazon and it worked out great. My book arrived in a timely manner, it was in the condition described (some highlighting and writing, but nothing too bad) and I was able to save money by avoiding the book store on campus .
I would give this product 0 stars, if that were an option. This was a waste of money and a waste of time. For a fee, it will do the exact same thing and a google search for a tv show or channel would. As for the "Live TV"... I couldn't seem to get it to work at all. I am going to try a return this and get my money back. Some much time wasted on this stupid little thing .
This is the 3 rd one I have had but this one is the best I have neck and spine problemsHave found this to be a great help even slept on my back which I have never done for yearsSo I am ever so pleased with it and would recommend this Topping for anyone to try theyWill love it as I doPeter Bell .
This item is a gift for my mum who collects salt & pepper shakers, loved it, haven't seen anything like this before. I'm sure she will love it. Postage was quicker than I expected as well which was great .
it seems to be a bit tall but it won't be a problem. Check the size in a shop if you can .
just one thing: it is not always very easy to do quick if you want something in the ruckbag, it is better to do it on a table... it is a very strong and nice bag, perhaps the most convenient bag i have always been looking for many years .
Don't get me wrong, I really love Black Veil Brides. The music was fantastic on this album. The extra songs were worth it. But as far as the Legion of Black video goes, I was very disappointed.It's just one long music video.No dialogue at all besides the dialogue that comes in the songs already.The story was hard to follow. It's not even a story really.If you want the extra songs, just buy them online. It's not worth your money to buy the video .
What a sweet message of the importance of mothers.  Too often mothers are underappreciated and undervalued. Not so here! Highly recommended for those who have or are mothers .
This game was purchased on accident, by my youngest daughter.  It has been a huge hit with the entire family.  The zombies are not too ugly and it is a fun game .
the worst costume I've seen. The mask is horrible ... only cover the face. better buy a mask in other store. The shirt is made &#8203;&#8203;of a very bad material and the hat is like a farmer's and is not real, is the same material as the mask .... Totally disappointing this costume .
there is not like looks in the internet picture.  The seams are not well finish.  fabric lycra costume is not thick or strong as seen in the image of the Internet .
Great book....I would highly recommend it. I wish I would have tried out for the teams. Never read a book in such a short amount of time .
I made the mistake of putting it in the dryer...don't do that...it's best to have it line dry or you will have to iron it to get it back to it's design size .
These shipped and were delivered very quickly! So cute and comfortable! Could not get anything better for the price! I absolutely love the jade and the turquoise one .
Its light wieght and protaect my Kindle very well, it's easy to clean when it gets dirty. couldn't be more happy .
Having bought this buggy as an entry level product with a view to getting back in to buggy racing then it was just what I was after. You can run it virtually stock in many clubs and this means it's down to your driving as to whether you win. It's great flying over jumps and better than the slash in this respect. However, you are well advised to buy the wheelie bar as under full throttle it wheelies virtually every time, which you may think is fun, and it is to start with but when you fire the power down hard coming out of a tight turn then it's just what you don't want. They are around $11-12 on amazon and are what I would class as an essential purchase. Buying a set of bearings will help increase the speed and more importantly the run time, and I'd recommend fitting a set as your second upgrade. Both of these are normally accepted mods but if you are planning on going racing check your clubs class rules.Battery life? 8-12 mins with the standard battery and then 8 hours for a recharge is not much fun, so budget for a larger capacity Nimh battery and a fast charger, the first will increase your run time, the second will charge it back up in around 45 mins, much more fun for you and /or your kids.You can even fit a Lipo 2S but will need a matching charger, combined this could cost you $150+. I would therefore suggest a 5000Mah Nimh on amazon at under $50 and a fast charger at $30-40 will be a much better bet for most people. You can purchase an 8 cell hump pack which will also increase the Rustlers top speed to over 40mph with the extra gear fitted. Note though that to fit an 8 cell pack you will need to fit the 'Battery expander pack' - a bargain at under $6.I would therefore say the rustler gives great fun in the back yard or on the racetrack at a very low price, but budget for an extra battery, fast charger and wheelie bar as they are all essential. The bearings are a good 'nice to have' option .
Goes against everything that nutritionists have learned in the past 75 years.From personal experience very minimal amounts of dairy and meats (preferably none at all) with the diet of vegetables, fruits, nuts,berries and seeds leaves me healthier and livelier feelingAlso forgot to mention that the lifespan of man up until modern day was much less and that disease was much more prominent with earlier man.Man still doesn't have the digestive tract for meat and dairy from animals .
Outfit skirt must have been made for a Barbie.  Skirt way too tight around the waist,  and the suspenders must be for those extremely large breasted (with an extremely tiny waist and hips.)  not for an average woman.  Definitely not one size fits most  Very disappointed,  because it's a very cute and sent .
Overall not a bad product.  Wish it came with the garter hosiery.  The arm bands are pretty weak  but overall,  it's OK .
I did not have to do any trimming the little that was left length wise, I just wrapped it underneath and it stays.  The color is decent a bit off from my other appliances, but it works very well, as I did not want to see a white dishwasher, nor was I in the market to purchase another one at this time .
Love the amp, great sound, lots of different settings. I recommend this to anyone. Don't know what else to say, it's awesome! I love it .
Nothing better to get started and to understand the raw concepts of MDX. I can highly recommend this to any and all BI people .
extremely satisfied with this purchase.the stories are of unique nature.Salinger does not write like o henry or somerset maughamThanks .
Sapphique is a dystopian/science fantasy book by author Catherine Fischer, and is the sequel to the first book in the Incarceron series, Incarceron. The book is about a hero Finn, whom has escaped the prison of Incarceron, leaving behind his friends Kiero, and Attia. Upon his return, Finn finds that his stepmother is trying to prevent him from becoming king, and the warden of Incarceron has become trapped in the prison himself. The daughter of the Warden has become infatuated with proving Finn to be the lost heir to the throne and rightful king. Finn, and Claudia's life are put into Finn's hands based upon his ability to convince the courts that he is indeed the lost heir to the throne.There were quite a few aspects of this book that I enjoyed about this book. The story was filled with an amazingly large amount of content for the reader, but moved at such a fast pace, while giving excellent descriptions of what was going on. The use of imagery was actually quite excellent. For example when there was a description given of the glove of Incarceron, it was as if you could actually see the glove levitating right before you. Although the book had a wealth of quality content that I found to my liking, there were a few things that I didn't enjoy so much. For example, one thing that I didn't enjoy in the book was the dialogue, interaction, and actions of some characters. The dialogue for one, was quite confusing at time. Also, I found Kiero, and Attia's relationship quite dull, as there seemed to be a sense stagnancy to the romantic side of their relationship. It seemed as though their relationship was more mutualistic for their survival while Incarceron, rather than as a couple whom loved each other. Also I found that the actions of the warden's daughter, Claudia were quite unorthodox. Although this was a science fantasy book, I still can't grasp why she would cling to Finn so much, even when he showed disdain for her following, and affection. However, she was still an important character as far as the development of the overall story.Despite the unorthodox actions of the characters, with their odd interactions, dialogue, and all I found this book to be unsurprisingly excellent. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys science fantasy, and dystopias, of course. If Catherine Fischer did choose to write another book for the Incarceron series, I would read it without hesitation, because Sapphique is a quality read, that was enjoyed greatly by myself .
The Hobbit (or There and back again) is a fantasy novel written by author J.R.R. Tolkien. The novel focuses on the life of a hobbit, a small humanoid creature with hairy feet, named Bilbo Baggins. Bilbo is a young Hobbit, who lives a quiet life, up until an old wizard named Gandalf the Grey makes an unexpected visit, which brings a multitude of guests (specifically Dwarves). The Dwarves employ a reluctant Bilbo Baggins as a burglar on their trip, as Hobbits are told to be extremely light on their feet. The rest of the book follows Bilbo on his journey with the Dwarves, and Gandalf on a quest to reclaim the mountain (the Dwarves&#8217; home) from a fire dragon, called Smaug, and explains how Bilbo came into the company of a powerful ring.There were several things that I enjoyed in this this novel. The first thing that I took liking to was the style in which this novel was written. There was a very enjoyable sense of calmness, pacing when this book was written, and it shows in the novel. There is a wealth of content, which is quality, and forces the reader to continue reading page after page. Another few things about the book that I enjoyed were the introduction, and development of the characters. In the beginning of the book Bilbo seemed to be a self-concerned, cowardly, stubborn, and timid Hobbit. Slowly, but steadily, Bilbo became a strong, independent, confident, and open-minded Hobbit due to the company, of the Dwarves and Gandalf. The Dwarves, were introduced in the beginning of the book as ignorant, uncouth, haughty, complacent, and self-forcing, and even a little mean spirited. Towards the end of the book, they became friendly, likeable, and cordial characters, while maintaining the rough essence of a warrior. Bilbo&#8217;s development as a character was enjoyable to observe, and correlated strongly with the Dwarves, something to the effect of dominoes. One change, or action by a character changed, or effected a character in another way. There was really only one thing that I didn&#8217;t enjoy in the novel, or thought could have been better. This thing was the way that some things were explained. Trying to explain some of the subject matter of this novel, while in Old English is no easy task, but the simple solution would&#8217;ve been to write using less sophisticated language, so that the reader would have an easier time comprehending what was at hand. Other than that, this was the only thing that I didn&#8217;t enjoy in the novel.Aside from the perplexing language choice used in this novel, I loved everything about this novel. J.R.R. Tolkien was clearly, thinking critically while developing, and writing this novel. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys fantasy, and questing. J.R.R. Tolkien has another book (The Desolation of Smaug) that is a sequel to The Hobbit, which I most certainly plan on obtaining, and reading, because I loved The Hobbit, and would read it over again several times, if I had the time .
This collar is working out so well. There are 2 options so you do not have to shock your dog you can just use the vibration and with most situations that's all our dog needs.Recharging is as easy as charging your phone .
If you have an RV this is the GPS for you. You will love the easy to use menu's. Won't leave home without it .
I recently bought 2 cameras and I am very happy with them. Setup was pretty simple and it works well with my email account, it's a decent camera with a decent web interface that does what it's supposed to do and works reliably, supports modern features and multiple users can be configured with different access levels.The pen and tilt moves almost silently, and are quick and precise. The LEDs on the rear panels can be disabled to be less conspicuous, in a nice touch.I really love these cameras so far. They are good budget priced cameras and other cameras with an image that's no better and software that's much worse are priced much higher. It's a great balance of modern features and decent quality .
I couldn't put it down! At the end it was, just... wow. It was better than the TV show in my opinion .
This is a beautiful bra and provides good support, is comfortable but the under wires in the front poke out :( And I can't return it so I'm stuck with it. Probably wont be ordering from Amazon again .
Lot of great advice to help family member who does not want to take their medication.  The book gave lots of insights and ways to help.  Easy reading  and practical tips.  I would recommend it to anyone who is having problems with a loved one who will not stay on their medication .
I'm not sure why anyone would be complaining about the fitment.. I have a 5 year old pair of Oakley's and these things fit better than ones from Oakley.. You gotta make sure you put them in correctly.. There not easy to snap all the way in.. These things are awesome!! Thanks to the seller for selling quality at more than half the price .

This battery has done a very poor job for me. It shipped in a great amount of time but dies very quickly. I followed all the installation instructions and still am displeased. I wouldn't recommend this provider or battery .
These shoes claim to stretch and I am hoping that they do as far as the top seam is concerned.  So far they are cutting into the top of my foot and are not all that comfortable.They look okay but not as good as I had hoped.  Not likely to purchase this style again .
These are the best shoes that I have purchased ever.  They wear well and are so comfortable.  I usually have pain on the bottom of the foot but not with these shoes.  I have to get more colors!  Highly recommend for anyone with sore feet.  These are just too good to be true .
These are so nasty they made me puke and not only that they made me WANT A REAL SMOKE, DO NOT BUY .
The chair has ridges sewn across the back that are not padded and the ridges cut into your back and I rarely use itand the massage unit in the footstool does'nt work at all, something wrong with the wiring.I am very sorry that I bought it .
I was looking for cal king burgundy sheets, basically a rich merlot color to match the rest of my bedroom. I am also a sheet snob a prefer cotton sheets with a high thread count.These looked ideal, then they arrived. The color is the exact same color as a raspberry or a dark pink - far from what I was looking for or expecting from the photo. They are not burgundy. One of the pillow cases had a hole the size of a silver dollar in the seam, the texture is okay at best. We used the sheets for a few weeks, I wash my bedding every week, and noticed the spots where my husband and I lay the fitted sheet started to turn white and wore very quickly and very poorly. I threw them out, giant waste of money .
I first saw these shoes in royal blue at Nordstroms, fell in love but was nervous to spend that much on shoes. Wanted to avoid an impulse buy I may regret later. I have thought about these shoes for over a year, saw them on amazon and my husband encouraged me to buy them. I am a 7 1/2 and got an 8 just in case these ran small like many designer shoes do.They arrived in the designer box with all of the material to ensure they shipped in perfect condition. Picture does not do justice, they are spectacular. They are a bit difficult to put on because of the tiny buckle and the holes in the strap were not quite wide enough for the pointy thing in the buckle, I forced it in and it was fine. The size 8 I ordered fit my 7 1/2 feet perfectly. The shoes look like jewelry and so versatile they work for business and evening.I did an all day event in Manhattan in these shoes and was surprised my feet were not overly sore like they usually are after 12 hours or so. There is a bit of a cushion for the ball of your foot, if I had foot petals in these I bet I would not have been sore at all. Going to dinner or an event on your feet for a few hours is extremely doable in these and they look fabulous, lots of compliments from men and women. I highly recommend them, just buy one half size bigger than you are .
My daughter LOVED the design and the ease of putting it on and taking it off when needed. Once ordered(at not on Prime) it was here in 4 days! Love this product and will order from this seller again, now that all four of my kids have iPods or phones .
Fernando Rodriguez @fernrod had the privilege of listening to Peter Kageyama in an interactive workshop sponsored by Leon County, the City of Tallahassee, Village Square and Knight Creative Communities Institute (KCCI). Fernando Rodriguez @fernrod would like to share his insights of the event:Love is a worn-out word. I couldn't count how many times I've heard somebody say, "I love my triple grande caramel macchiato" or my wife ask me "Don't you love how these jeans fit me?" For those reasons, I was skeptical when I opened the email that read Register to Attend the For the Love of Cities: Tallahassee + Leon County Workshop. I was invited to attend this interactive workshop sponsored by Leon County, the City of Tallahassee, Village Square and Knight Creative Communities Institute (KCCI). The guest speaker was author Peter Kageyama, who has spoken all over the world about bottom up community development and the amazing people that are making change happen.The day of the workshop finally came. As I entered the FSU Alumni Association, I could see a heterogeneous group of men, women, senior citizens and college students, Caucasians, African-Americans, Hispanics and even members of the LBGT community. At my table were other unofficial "city-makers," creative people with a passion for their hometown that want to make it a better place to live and identify ideas that help make things happen.Dressed in jeans and a t-shirt, Peter addressed a captive audience saying, "A mutual love affair between people and their place is one of the most powerful influences in our lives, yet rarely thought of in terms of a relationship" as images of museums, playgrounds, bike paths, pedestrian walks and monumental works of art, were projected on the screen.I was familiar with most of these places. I had recently taken my family to New Orleans and visited the National World War II Museum. I have strolled down the pedestrian walk at Times Square and admired Cloud Gate, one of the monumental works of art at Chicago's Millennium Park. Nothing was new, except the term he coined to describe them: love letters from the city.Peter focused our attention to the center of the table. There were easel papers, Post-it-notes, pencils and colored markers. He asked each participant to write what we loved about Tallahassee on a Post-it note, come up to the microphone and share it with everyone. This is when his true gift was revealed: the ability to move people to action.After a few minutes, most of the room eagerly started to make their way to the microphone. One after another, each person filled the room with a sense of pride that I had not felt before. They were saying, "I love Tallahassee's bike trails," "I love our canopy roads," "I love Tallahassee Community College" and the anticipated "I love the Seminoles!!!"Peter gave us two more assignments: to come up with a design for a Tallahassee t-shirt and to create a new (or revive an old) city ritual or tradition. Again, a long line of volunteers stepped up to the mic and share their "50 Shades of Trees" and "Talla-Happy" t-shirt designs, among others.The ritual or tradition ideas generated by attendees were as creative. "Let's bring back the hot air balloon festival" and "We suggest closing Tennessee St. and break Bosnia's world record of 1,521 couples dancing in the streets. This would certainly give another meaning to the expression: Tennessee Waltz." The audience was energized!That day I learned two valuable lessons. When we consider the emotional connection we have with our cities, we open up new possibilities in community, social and economic development, and love is not a worn-out word after all .
Works well enough. Just can't seem to figure out how to tighten the knob that keeps it from moving up and down so easily. Maybe it's just me though .
These are a pretty good option if you want some cheap headphones fast, they work great, have a nice design, although their not my favorite type of headphones, I still like them quite a bit .
Have been buying this brand for 20 years and the product keeps getting better.  We love this mattress pad and it's new design.  The plug-in is at the head of the bed (rather than at the foot), and each side has it's own circuit (rather than wired in parallel).  The plug in is on the vertical side (rather than on top, like many other brands), so it is out of sight and feeling.Can't feel the heating wires at all.  Agree with others that the highest setting (10) is WAY too warm, but you will soon learn what works for you.  My husband heats up his side on 4, while I use a toastier 7-8 setting.  Within 10 minutes of being in bed, I usually shut it off, as my body heat is enough to keep me comfortable.This is a really good investment and I highly recommend it.  No drawbacks at all .
I'm trying to lose 20 lbs by my birthday and this is a nice addition to my workout routine. Not nearly as hungry when I'm done with my workouts .
This is the best Argan oil I have used thus far! Absolutely no complaints here. I will definately continue to use this in my skincare products .
I just received this awesome decal! I also received two practice stickers as well.I had a gift card and decided to splurge!The instructions were clear, however the decal did not easily adhere to my MacBook Air.I had to use an ID card while peeling off the paper so it would stick.Now that it is on I love it .
three of the six bag soups where opened and leaking the box. They were not sealed at the bottom of the bags .
This couch was delivered broken it will only flat as a bed and  the back will not lock as a couch.  the drill holes did not match so the legs did not fit either .
I love them, I just wish they fit in my ear a little better like ear buds. They are great for working out because they don't fall out if my ears and cords don't rip them out .
Great knife for the price....not crazy about the serated edge but overall a good knife for anyone looking for a good affordable all around knife .
Good knife for the money...not to ctazy about the serated edge but overall a good knife for the money, a great knife if you don't want to spend alot .
What can I said I'm In enjoying the game I didn't think I would but I did and now I can't seen to be able to put it down.the only thing I didn't like about the game is that it take to long to refill the energy but other then that! it fun .
I hope I had found this a long time. I can not wait to start putting it to use. Thank you so much. You are a value creator. I will recommend this to anyone who wants to start a business with little money .
One of the best books I have ever read about starting a global business. I can not stop reading it. As a neo- writing. think member, I understand and knows what the author is writing. I would recommend this book to all who are thinking of starting a global business .
I don't need to write a review if youre looking for this movie well youre a howard fan awesome!!! bababoey to yall .
Story ended too abrupt.Many people were involved in the story, i.e. Cody, Bailey, Ashley and family, but none of the individual stories had an ending .
Very intriguing story and I couldn't put the book down.Lynn Austin remains my favourite author.I have introduced her books to friends and family members and they were just as excited about her books .
I DJ not recommend it's a waste of  and time,  your better off with no case.  don't waste your time .
its a good game its just if you don't buy glu credits you cant purchace most of the guns thats the only downfall .
great addictive game wish i had whole game but its good for free just not that many boards unless u buy .
I really like this headset, the clarity is great, no noticable background noise.  I like that I do not have to keep something in my ear all the time but the headset is conviently in place .
I used to want this lotion so bad a couple years ago but I never did because it was so expensive. Well now I finally got it when it was a lot cheaper and it works awesome. It smells like Tommy Hilfiger. (yummy) and it always made me have a great tan .
I bought this lotion about 3 months ago. I REALLY like this lotion, it smells like Tommy Hilfiger (so good) I get really dark after I use this. I would def. reccemond this to anyone. When I'm out of this lotion I will buy it again. You will not be discouraged .
Not sure how to use it. It is a pain in the ass if you ask me. If your good with hair you might understand it. it looks kind of granny also when its in your hair .
I bought this for my boyfriend and I's one year for him. He loves it as do I. I am thinking about getting myself one. It is kind of big but the sizes are correct for 4 X 6 pictures. I would recemmond this to anyone that needs a gift idea or something just to hang in there house. You HAVE to hang it on a wall. It will not just sit up some where. Its adorable and I love it .
I ordered the Sun Power like in the description and I received &#34;Natural&#34;. It was way too light of a shade for my skin tone and that's not what I wanted. I called Eileen at the house of beauty and she said she did not have that shade. She refunded my money but if your interested in the sun power she does not have it. Truly disappointed because I really wanted the Sun power not the natural .
Who doesn't enjoy a classic John Wayne movie?  I ordered this classic for my father in-law. It is one of our favorite John Wayne classics .
directions were written in japanese or chinese, whatever, I could not read them. too bad the packaging was ripped so no return .
I was very satisfied with this durable jewelry holder. It works very well for size 14G jewelry. I have all my jewelry neatly organized and now I don't have to go through the frustrations of losing my body jewelry. I use this for navel rings and it securely holds all the barbells in place. I am very satisfied with this product and I do plan on ordering from this company again .
It freezes a lot and does it's own thing. I don't like it at all. Trying to talk my mom into returning it .
I've had this screen protector on for at least a week or two now, and I really have no complaints. My brother put it on for me, but he didn't have trouble with bubbles and the screen protector hasn't peeled or anything yet. It's working really well, and I'm very satisfied. Love that there are 3 screen protectors, they'll last a while .
These keyblade pendants are just breathtaking! The ones I received are exactly like the picture except the velvet in my box was red. The box came in fairly decent condition, but the pendants were in perfect shape and they're a good size. I couldn't even see the cast-line for them and all of them seem pretty sturdy to me. You do need to get loops for them because the keyhole (XD) is pretty small, and even if you did find a small chain, they would hang sideways. Even with the task of having to buy loops for them, I think these are still very much worth their price. I've worn all of them once but Diamond Dust, Three Wishes and Oathkeeper (Only because I associate certain days and moods with them and haven't gotten around to those yet). Oh, Spellbinder is the wrong color as shown, it's supposed to be blue, but I actually like it better in red. It almost reminds me of Halloween Town.So overall, these are pretty amazing. I'm often so captivated by them that I just sit and look at them.  I love Kingdom Hearts, so these were a must, but they're still &#34;pretty pendants&#34; according to my friends who haven't played any games in the series. The keyblades are high-quality, a brilliant silver color (okay, Spellbinder is red and silver),  and to die for! Where else do you think you'll find something like this? Go ahead and buy them, you know you want to! You've got to step forward to realize this wish .
I've had my eyes set on this necklace for months, just waiting for my birthday to buy it, and then a month afterwards. I finally placed the order and got it shipped on time, in perfect condition. Before ordering, I read some reviews and doubted they were accurate; I didn't believe the piece was so perfect. Now, every time it catches my eye, I spend 20 minutes just staring at it before I eventually put it on and then stare at it some more. The "drops of blood" and the red inside the heart are that perfect shade of crimson you wish you could find in a ruby. Also, I find the silver gleam of the necklace to truly stand out, it's so eye catching, and the necklace is a decent size too! Overall, I'm definitely pleased with this. In my opinion, it's a necklace like no other .
This case is really perfect for me. It arrived in 3 business days in a cheap &#34;made in china&#34; wrapping, but the case was much higher in quality than its wrapping. It has a nice, smooth feel and there are no flaws in the stitching. All the holes are perfect in size, my headphone jack can still be easily used, I can access the charger through the case, and the camera's lense isn't obscured or anything by the case. I haven't dropped my iPod Touch yet, but I'm much less paranoid about it falling now (before the case arrived, I kept the loop on my hand and sat directly on my carpet, bed, or other soft surface that wouldn't hurt my device if I dropped it). This case keeps it very secure and I can still hold onto it with the iPod's loop.I got my case in red to match my iPod Touch and I recommend buying cases that match the iPod's color, unless you love purple or orange. I really think the seller had the shades made so that they're like a perfect match, baby pink looks about the same color as a pink iPod Touch 5th gen, and so on. The matching colors of the iPod and case look spectacular! Overall, this is a very nice case with a great feel to it and good protection too! I'm very satisfied with my purchase; this case is everything I could really ask for .
I like it alot, use it quite a bit but I have to watch my usage of it because I CAN'T find it in the stores around here???????That includes, Target, Walmart,HyVee, Fareway, Walgreen's. I don't know why you put a good product out then you can't buy it???My Zipcode is 50054I live in Iowa the stores I shop are within 20 mi. they include DesMoines, Altoona, Newton?? Well I got that off my Chest, if you have some laying around send me some Richard C. Horton at 9784 Hwy F-48 W. Colfax, Ia. 50054 .
As my first pair of bike shorts, they are comfortable but a little restricting.  It's nice to finally have some padding, but I don't feel as if the padding is ample or made of the best material.  At this price range though, they are well worth it .
I chose this rating because they are practical and work relatively well for at least being seen by drivers however I would not ride and rely solely on the front light to see which you would expect for this price.  The one pitfall I came across was when fitting it onto my bike, the attachments or at least the screws were relatively small and I had to replace them with longer ones.  All in all, well worth the money spent .
I've had my eye on these sleeping bags for a while and finally decided to buy them (one left & one right zipper) for camping this summer... It was by far the best purchase I could have made! I was worried that it might be a tight squeeze for two people and that we wouldn't be able to move much. Boy was I wrong! I have a queen air mattress and when these sleeping bags are zipped together, they actually hang off the side of the bed. They are fairly light weight but completely warm. Between an air mattress and these sleeping bags it was like sleeping on a cloud. Everyone who camped with us wants one now. I would recommend this sleeping bag to anyone .
Very disappointed. I knew that I had been HAD when I was reading through and saw that publishers in this booked accepted CASSETTES! Really?...... As I did more research I found that people listed as &#34;producers&#34; were in fact NOT. One name I already knew and the person is a vocal coach.....Its sad really. Writer/Editor of this book: very unprofessional...... Do not waste your money .
I bought this product a year ago for 2 stray,somewhat feral cats who now basically live on my balcony. Though not a perfect product, it is really a good one. The cats do stay pretty warm n dry. The winters are pretty cold in the Northeast and they sleep in it every nite. I think that it's pretty waterproof. Snow has gotten on the roof and it stayed dry inside.My only gripe is that it's  really not big enough, so  I just purchased the larger size .
LOVE THIS CREAM.......I was very upset when the glycolic acid cream I was using was no longer available.. I stumbled onto this one..LOVE IT.....Hope this company stays in business for a long time .
I bought this phone for my father for Christmas it was awful!!!!! The camera didn't work, it was cracked and broken in multiple different places. When we brought it to the apple store they told us someone had replaced the screen, so it was no longer and apple display and they couldn't even replace the phone!!! Can not be used at all and was SUCH a waste of money. And NOW, trying to return it is impossible!Don't east your money. These @ssholes are just going to rip you off. TRUST me .
It does not work I give it no stars charger won't work when I charge my phne when I try to charge the charger does not work .
Pretty good TCSM movie. Waaaaay better than the 2013 3D debacle. I really wish that this blu ray didn't have French on it underneath all the English stuff, but it plays and I guess that's all that matters .
Who could possibly NOT love this movie. Great classic even better on blu ray. Highly recommend for any fan of Van Damme, Lundgren, or action movies in general .
Forgetting for a moment that I horribly misspelled a Mary Poppins song just now, let's talk about Federation! This book is awesome! It is crafted to look like a history book (From the Next Gen era) detailing the events from Cochrine's first warp flight, to Captain Kirk's death (And possibly further, I haven't read through the whole thing yet). It has an introduction by ADMIRAL Hikaru Sulu (Not sure if actually George Takei's voice, I tried to listen closely and honestly, it's a tossup) describing the book and feeling rather honored. It comes with some cool &#34;artifacts,&#34; like a letter from Jim Kirk to his mother and the envelope to a bill that Zephram Cochrane wrote on (His famous, &#34;Where no man has gone before&#34; speech). Perhaps my favorite part is the chapters about the founding of the Federation and the Romulan War. Ya know, the stuff they WOULD have gotten to in season 5 had Star Trek Enterprise not been cancelled RIGHT before it was to start getting really good. But I digress, the book is a must have for any Trekkie. So if you guys haven't gotten it yet, get it NOW .
A good horror movie. But not a great Halloween movie. The studio had intended for Michael Myers to remain dead and start a different direction with the series in which each movie had a different plot and villain, it did not work and so they brought Mikey back in the fourth installment. But THIS, Season of The Witch, is what we got from that brief time of insanity. As I said, it's a good '80s horror movie, but a bad Halloween movie .
I was pleased with the condition it was in when I received it, but this movie is awful. Even White as the villain couldn't make up for the crap they shove down your throat in this movie .
Great album! And it arrived on my birthday!!!!! I was able to blast it on my way to my family dinner which was really nice. It's a great party album, no joke. Even if most of the songs sound the same .
I love Bruce Willis and Halle Berry ain't so bad herself. I even like that little weaselly guy... Ben Foster? I think so... anyway good movie. Not a bad thriller .
Great crossover series. Great blu ray set (Even if it is just the individual releases in a sleeve). Recommended for fans of Alien especially as the story in these seems to follow the Alien franchise more than Predator. I don't suppose there was much to go on as far as story arc from the Predator movies, although a Schwarzenegger cameo would have been graciously accepted by THIS guy .
Pretty good show (even if they did mess up some major Superman canon) and this set is AMAZING!!! All kinds of extras and little things like the newspaper and an episode guide (I believe). I got it for my brother for Christmas so I'm not sure about everything in it but it seems pretty cool to me .
Definitely not the best or worse season of TOS as I have heard from some people. There were only three seasons so I don't know really how to pick a least favorite but if I had to it wouldn't be this one. Or 1 or 2 either... but I digress. Great season of a great show that ended before it should have. My one complaint is that it was '69 and they got cancelled so there isn't really a series finale which is sad because it would have been a good one I'm sure. And it would have made the beginning to Star Trek: The Motion Picture even better. Oh well, still amazing .
As far as today's thriller/horror genre goes, I am fed up with watered down PG-13 movies that try to distract us from lack of gore with an overproduced plot and mediocre special effects. And I saw this movie because I'm a fan of Daniel Craig and his beautiful wife Rachel Weisz, and because I was interested to see the movie they met while making. And even though I think the above of the newer thriller/horror genre, I can tell you that is not the case with this movie. Very good movie and well acted and fun to watch. Recommend .
Great song. I love all things Bond (Even Die Another Day) and when I first heard this new song I thought, &#34;Yes! Finally a good old fashioned (yet somehow still new age) Bond theme. And it's by Adele! That will DEFINITELY score me points with the ladies if I start listening to Adele!!&#34; It has yet to score me any points with the ladies. Besides this song and that one about defying the laws of physics by lighting water on fire, it has mostly just annoyed me. But I'm getting sidetracked... Great song! Good going, Adele, you're not completely useless .
I read this book in one sitting, it was too hard to stop.  I felt like if I stopped reading and picked it up at a different time it wouldn't have had as much of an impact on me. This book made me feel more emotions in its 213 pages than in any other book I've read.  And it was so relatable!Best money I've spent in a while, worth the read definitely .
This product is great for suppressing your appetite, which ultimately keeps you focused on your weight loss goals. I find that if I take one pill in the morning then I am not hungry for the day. I usually have to force myself to eat something. I combine these pills along with the Ultra Pure Green Coffee Bean, a product also sold by this company.I am truly pleased with the result of this product. So pleased that after finishing my first bottle of each, I email NatureWise to brag about my success with their product. The customer service IS THE BEST. They care about their customers and they are super supportive.There have been nothing but good experiences all around with this product, Friendly employees and an awesome product!If you love the product after trying it, then you too can contact the company and then hey will ship you a free body of the product .
The gloves look and feel very nice but are not built to last.  I rode only 200 miles with these gloves before I had to purchased new gloves. After the first ride the seems start to come apart.  I wouldn't recommend these gloves .
The one I have is way too loud, even after I tried covering the speaker with 3 layers of duct tape to dull the volume. I can't stand for it to be played with because it's obnoxiously loud and I don't want it to damage our ears .
Fotorama Johnny The Skull Skill And Action GameDo not buy this product, broke in 5min waste of money I do not recommend to anyone .
If you know nothing about QFD, or you have had a training course, and now have to start working in the real world this book is for you. It realy does as the title says. Take you step by step throught the whole process. The layout and example are clear and helpful .
I have more than 30 headphones ranging from 100-800 dollars including different sennheisers, AKGs, Audio technica, bose and ete. I can say this is the best sounding headphones ever. I even like the sound of it better that HD700.The sound of it without amp is perfect and with amp is even better. The treble and mids are perfect.  The bass is sepctacular. Better than any other headphones. IMO the BASS is better than Beats, Bose and Sonys.Fantastic little cans. Just consider it's portability, shouldn't be called the best headphones???!!! For those who want to compare it with Grado S60i and S80i, those are neven even not close to this and are not very portable.I think this is the best you can get around 100$ and IMO up to 800 .
If you want the bass that rattles your head and face plus good mids and treble, don't waste your time more. I have 30 audiophile and basshead headphones. I can say, this is the best basshead headphones with no doubt followed by monster inspiration and sony Pulse Elite. People that comlain about the highs and mids havnt heard other headphones. You can not get better with so significant bass. Also remeber that this in a closed back headhphone. IMO this is the best you can get with maximum base and ok mids and treble. There no better option. There are better headphones for mids and highs but bass falls short on them like AKGs 702 or AD M50. Only thins is beware of sound leakage .
Love the Bluetooth keyboard and the fact it's pink. I've seen compatible items in stores for double the money but the colors are limited.  Don't like how my tablet isn't fully secure inside. It needs for corner supports,  not two .
First I would like to thank Amazon for all the help and information plus the wish list feature. You found me a unit with ease ofuse at a price that I could afford. I am a recent student of the computer (June of 2012). I have not had a problem with thisitem yet, I take classes at a computer club and this size seems to have the least problems.Thank you for all you do .
We are in a time and a generation that focus' so much on the self. The desire to discover oneself, or to find oneself, or create oneself is advertised all around us. Which leaves us with the question. &#8220;What if people do not like who I truly am?&#8221; we ask ourselves. So we create a someone that we think everyone will like. As soon as that happens, there is no backing out. We must not only pretend to live that life, but we must make the stories more adventurous; describe ourselves as more free. We are left fighting against our own lies.Lomas describe the ways in which we create ourselves or see ourselves:You&#8217;re a mom. A dad. A child of divorce. A business owner or a freelancer. Male, female, black, white. You&#8217;re an introvert, an extrovert, a person who refuses to be labeled as either. You&#8217;re gay, you&#8217;re straight. You&#8217;re a success, a failure, someone who never lived up to others people&#8217;s expectations, or someone no one ever believed in. you control your own destiny or you cannot seem to escape the labels other people give you (Lomas, 27).He continues&#8230;If you don&#8217;t know the truest thing about yourself, you don&#8217;t know yourself. And that matters. What you believe about yourself determines how you live. We were made for something. Something bigger than the little things we seem fated to surround ourselves with (Lomas, 32-33).So then, what is that &#8220;thing?&#8221; I believe, as does Lomas, that Genesis tells us this quite clearly:So God created man in His own image; He created him in the image of God (Genesis 1:27).We don&#8217;t find our identity. Rather, we receive our identity. We are given it by God (Lomas, 69).Lomas wants his readers to know that the voices that tell you that you are not good enough and that you must create something more unique are not the truest thing about you. In fact most are lies created in your head.The fact is that you are a beloved child of God and He sees nothing but Christ&#8217;s perfection in you. This frees you to be who you are with no fear. You do not need to create yourself. The pressure is gone. You can now live free as the beloved. All those voices evaporate as the Father says &#8220;You are a child of mine.&#8221;  He does not need your acting. No. He just wants you as you are. Fasten the &#8220;Belt of truth around every morning.&#8221; The truth that says you are a child of God and everything pales in comparison.Highly highly recommend this book .
i have ordered it before but it came scratched and i couldn't find a reliable source to obtain the anime. kanon itself i have wtach five times already i recommend it to anyone .
Pros:No input lag (Had input lag on the Elgato when used with a Asus monitor)Small and PortableRan the coolest between the Elgato and HDPVR2Roxio's device is supported by multiple programs.Roxio has a built in LIVE stream program which lets you stream directly to Twitch.tv (Hauppauge and Elgato will soon follow)High bitrate while recordingAmazing Price. I purchased it for $98 and I have seen people get it for less.Worked flawlessly out of the box. No need to download codecs..etcCons:Too light, Feels cheap. (The Elgato and HDPVR2 feels better)Does not include any HDMI/Component cables. At $150 retail I would expect it to.The Design. I think the USB should have been in the middle so it doesn't interfere with the output or inputs.Neither the Roxio, Elgato, or the Hauppauge HDPVR2 would display the image as crisp/sharp if I was to bypass the products.HDPVR1 still has better raw recordings than all the external capture cards I have tested so far. Elgato comes in close second with the Roxio and HDPVR2 following.Program randomly stops running after streaming for about 45mins. (This can be fixed in the future)Conclusion: At $100 you really are getting the most bang for your buck. I had a really good experience with the Roxio. I would recommend this product when it's on sale. At retail price I would be looking at Elgato's and/or Hauppauge's products to get the include cables at around the same price .

Without a doubt, if you are thinking about purchasing these lights just do it, you won't be disappointed. Keep in mind the lights are packaged with a flush mount box that is needed.  These lights are not designed to mount to a standard in wall outlet box.I bought two of them for our front deck/carport area as they offered the utilitarian design and flush mount installation that I was looking for .
I got the case and did everything the manual showed and the charger did not work. I did this for two days and it never charged my iPhone 4 .
I have had bark covers before but this one was crazy crazy dark for me I wasn't happy with it .
The sizes are not true to what they have in the wed. get a size or 2 bigger then what your are.. i'm a large and ill be getting a xxl .
Nice shoes they fit nice, at the beginning a lil tight but then they start adjusting to your feet form. I like them a lot l have it a four star bc the heel is ok not great I would've be perfect if the heel had a stronger support .
Honestly I have been using the product for two weeks now and I have to say that I have hereditary dark eye circles but yet before I decide to write my review I look myself in the mirror with a bright light like a thousand times so I can give details of my improvement. Well first of all I use the product in all my face and neck, my face appearance looks more bright and my eyes look a little refresh that is why I didn't fill in all the stars bc I am still waiting on a more deep result on my eye area but honestly they look much better than when I wasn't using this product oh another thing I would like to add ladies if you have a minimal dark spot in your face this product helps!!!! Honestly I had dark spot on both side of my upper checks and I don't see it any longer so keep that in mind I guess since is a natural product it works great on skin. Ideally like my queen bee and when it finish I would buy another also ladies when applying this product on your face don't forget the sun screen is very essential :- .
I bought this as a Christmas gift for my Mom.  She never knew she looked so good wearing the color red .
The picture of this product is wrong or the seller just made a mistake. I got the Beatles Abbey Road cover shirt, not this Sgt. Pepper one. It's nice but not what was ordered. And it does fit too small compared to most smalls i've ordered before .
I love it and i lost 10lbs the first two in half weeks doing almost everyday and if you love to dance then this is great for you.....  I love to get down to these dance moves too, easy to learn if you no how to dance and if you no what you are doing too .
Just what I needed for my dryer.  Could find it nowhere in any store locally.  Even the appliance store that sold the dryer did not have it, nor offered to help me get a bulb.  That did not sit well with me.  So, you helped me.  I bought two, and that should do me for quite some time.Thank you very much .
I fell in love with this series right from the beginning - the Men are hot and sexy and the ladies are loveable - BUT this book - WOW!!! all I can say is WOW!! Jarod is beyond hot and Sexy and Ce Ce - well you just can't help but love and admire her!  Wendy hit it out of the ball park with this book.  From the moment I read the first line to the very end of the book I was captivated and intrigued.  I was torn because I couldn't wait to find out what direction the book was taking but sad that it had to end.  You fall so easily into the book - totally worth the read .
Firstly, the power supply transformer was a dud.  Checked with multimeter, no output.  Obtained a replacement power supply, and the router responded as expected when power was supplied, but my computer (Toshiba Satellite running Windows 7 Professional) did not recognize it.  Followed Cradlepoint instructions to configure, router ceased responding and locked up on first window.  No response at all after that.Fortunately, Amazon's return service worked exactly as advertised.  Unit was returned without a hitch .
The Sightron SIII has the clarity, resolution, edge-to-edge sharpness, and color accuracy to match scopes costing twice as much.  The ranging data provided with the scope makes range estimation and target sizing simple.  And the 50X magnification allows very precise aim out to 1000 yards.  The old rule applies, "You can't hit what you can't see.", and with the Sightron SIII, seeing your target is no problem .
I thought this report was GARBAGE! You can get better,MUCH BETTER information from elsewhere.There are no "how to' s" and most of the things he says are just general common sense stuff that we ALL already know for the most part.Don't waste your money on this garbage .
My girlfriend and I recently started our N-Force collection, and we already have a considerable selection to choose from when we battle.  These are great fun and her little boy loves them so much too!Nerf always make great products and this is no exception.Arrived well in time for Christmas, my only gripe was that the surprise was ruined with an error in the gift wrapping that I had paid just under $6 but Amazon's customer service were GREAT, responding and refunding the gift wrap price almost immediately after I took it up with them.I've done almost all of my Christmas shopping through Amazon and have no regrets (a fair few nerf products and all the others were gift wrapped fine, so I guess this was just an anomaly)Thank you to the seller and to Amazon for great customer service .
For an excited 2 year old who can't sleep a few weeks before Christmas, I let him open one of his presents early, namely the Cars 2 Lightening McQueen Light, and he LOVES it.  He loves anything Lightening McQueen and gets so excited about the pop up light.He's still holding on to it and will probably fall asleep with it.The toy is as much fun as any toy car for a boy who loves to play with cars, and of his favourite movie character AND a light, it's the trifecta of a great Christmas present and I was thrilled to find it.I gave the car 3 stars for educational but only since I couldn't decide how to rate it, it's fun watching him push the button to get the light and voice sounds and it's about as educational as any toy car can be for a two year old.The toy looks fairly durable, but as with all 2 year olds I'm sure there's a way, for the price though it was worth it watching the present being torn open and it'll last a long while after that.Fast delivery courtesy of the perks of Amazon Prime.  Over all, we're all thrilled with the excitement it's brought as an early Christmas gift .
Pros:*Paint doesn't come off.*Well molded.*nice varietyCons:*Some coloring is incorrect*Painting isn't perfect, but it's okay.*These are bootleg toys, the molds are stolen from official figures.*Some pieces come off easily, like Gigan's arm .
Not only does this tank not work as promised, it is also too small. Any fish living in it won't grow any more than an inch or live past 6 months due to the size of the &#34;tank&#34;. Instead of this, go get a REAL fish tank. Most fish need 5-10 gallon tanks, and they aren't that expensive either. Depending on the type of fish, they need a heater, a air stone, and a filter. With all of these, the fish will most likely will live at least 5 years .
Is not as goog as  I Believed, Does not compress too much space, It usually open by it self in the journey .
These wire sepatators work great, I am able to keep my plug wire in  order without the wires coming loose . Saves  alot of time when changing plugs , or  adjusting valves, not having to figure out which wire goes to which plug. Nice part at a great price. They are plastic, not metal, but do the job as intended .
Brackets fit great. didn't realize when I bought shifter that it would come with a variety of brackets for alot of different transmissions. I thought this was a mounting kit? I already had these same brackets with the shifter kit, so I didn't use them .
I would recommend this to anyone wanting to use up propane from older bottle that can not be filled anymore. or have not been retrofit .
I like this book but I thought it was the type of Amelia bedelia books I read as child and it is not that .
I bought these to wear at my wedding. I love the blue birds. The boots are pointy but I don't think it is too much like some other people have said. I did order them a half size smaller like other people have posted. I have large calf muscles so it can be hard for me to wear certain shoes that are taller. These fit me without a problem and I was actually surprised! The boot is also comfortable compared to some of my other cowboy boots .
My daughter looks soooo cute in these boots. The quality is even better then I expected! Could not be happier .
I was very disappointed with the belly band. It's made for someone who doesn't have any hips. It bunches up and is very uncomfortable. It's very bulky and can't be worn under a regular shirt. I think this product was a waste of money .
This was the fourth battery I had to try and after two months it is working great. Lasts a long time. At first the computer wouldn't tell me how much battery power I had left and would suddenly shut down, but then it recently started telling me I have 10% so I don't have to worry about an improper shutdown. Happy this product is working well. Company also was very helpful by sending emails to let me know that if I had any problems they were there to help. Response was very quick .
I used this vest to deer hunt this year in some pretty rough terrain I drug a 250lb whitetail buck 1/2 mile and up a 100 foot steep hill with the shoulder straps no problem it made things so easy I love it I bought 3 of them .
it is so so big and the colour is not so beautiful.just some dispointment.hope good effect.ha ha ha ha ha .
They fit great. Very comfortable. Only washed them once, no wrinkles! Love that. I usually wear dockers, but these are going to give them a run for the money .
They are great, I don't have to iron them. Also, they are very cool (temperature cool) for a synthetic material .
It was missing one of the bags of parts.  My grandson was not able to play with it. Very disappointed .
My grandson noticed that there was no white ball on the end of Santa's hat. Attention to detail! That kid notices everything .
It started off very good but then it started getting very boring. I did  not like the ending AT ALL. It is very simple and does not say much. It is left open. The worst part is that the sequel doesn't tell what happens next. It is just a different story. We will never know what happened to Jonah at the end .
I loved it! It helped me understand the scene better! If you loved Divergent, I'd definitely recommend that you read this book! It's very short, so it doesn't take long .
I am writing this review so that no one will make the same mistake that I did. I bought this poster a few weeks ago. I was very disappointed. It arrived very quickly in about 4 days, however, the quality of the poster is horrible! Nothing like the image shown! The paper it was printed on was very flimsy and cheap. The colors were so off! It looked NOTHING like the image shown!!! Their customer support is horrible! They NEVER responded any of my emails and messages. I am still waiting for a response! I was not even able to return it! It was like I simply just threw my $10 in the trash! This poster is not even worth a dollar! Horrible horrible quality and horrible customer support. I hope that no one will buy this poster and make the same mistake that I did .
THE GUM WAS HORRIBLE TASTING...OLD AND HARD...THE WORST EVER I JUST THREW IT IN THE CORNER  ANYBODY WANT ITIT WAS NOT REAL BAZOOKA .
Amazing book. There's nothing false about it. I wish I could meet these dudes.Everything these guys did is remarkable and none of them should have been convicted of anything .
The plastic disc skips so my lines look dotted.  I borrowed a friend's rubber stylus and it didn't skip at all .
I've never written a review before but I had to for this book because it was literally so horrible. I had seen some quotes from it that seemed so beautiful that I just had to read it -- and there were some great quotes, but they were obscured by the rest of this monstrosity of horrible-ness. The characters are extremely underdeveloped and two-dimensional. Sutter is this raging alcoholic who doesn't feel anything as much as he says he does. I feel like his motto of embracing the now is a total sham, because although he says to live in the moment ten million times, he's just going through the actions. Getting drunk and going to parties and talking to attractive women...this doesn't mean you are always living spectacularly. Not if it means shoving your actual feelings into a deep dark hole and not caring about anyone who loves you. Then there's Aimee, who I feel has so much potential but instead is a character who Sutter simply uses and corrupts. Sutter keeps saying he wants to show Aimee she can be her own person and that she doesn't have to be trodden on by her family, but then Sutter goes ahead and stomps all over her. I didn't like the writing style of Tharp much either. It never quite flowed well for me .
We all think we do not have the time...for worship, for prayer, or just to study God's word. I know that I do a lot in my day, but once I evaluated what I did and how long it took, I realized I DID have time .
Every time you need to get some item to hire a person it takes a lot of energy. You may get one quick,but it is so seldom. Sometimes it may take you several full sets of energy and you still don't get the item. I got sick of it. Not fun anymore .
It is aight, ain't tryin to buy stuff on here like those coins, so I'll just get free ones any way I can .
Change of Address was a great book! Rick did an awesome job at developing the characters through vivid description without using too much as filler. Overall the book moved pretty fast. It had a few different side plots to where something was always happening or being uncovered. Can't wait to read the others .
This thing works awesome and you can't really beat the price. It works better than many of the toys we've spent a considerable amount more on. Buy it .
Very cute! rolls well, burns well.. Nothing more to really say.. Buy some! I will be ordering more in the near future. Only complaint is the shipping is kinda high for something so small .
The stamper works great but the scraper thing is metal and I hate it. A credit card works just as good though, if not better .
Looks hot and fits awesome! I plan on buying the lime one too; but I'm not quite sure why it would be twice the price for the same exact thing only in a different color .
I wanted to get a color that wasn't pink, since that is what the majority of my Gelish collection is. I though a bright purple would be cool. Color doesn't look purple at all .
I agree with whoever said the person that designed the lines needs to be fired. WTH were they thinking? Other than that I have no real complaints so far.The little signal booster thinggy made the keyboard act all screwy. Without it, it works fine .
The concept is cool and the distance on the remote is pretty good. It's not very loud, but the vibration is also kind of weak. Not a horrible toy, but definitely not worth the price .
After reading reviews on many lights I finally chose this one and couldn't be happier with my choice!! It cures my Gelish polish perfectly, light bulbs are easy to put in and replace and the light has so much hand room! I was so sick of hitting my nails on my old LED light but I don't have to worry about that with this light. If you're looking for a good light to cure gel nails this one is a great choice .
Case is very cute! No paint chipping, no lost stones (yet)...I've only dropped my phone once with this case but so far, so good. Will definitely buy more from them in the future.One thing that I like about ECO.. It seems they actually take the time to respond to the customers who have had negative reviews. Who does that anymore? Hardly no one. Good for them.. that's refreshing to see .
We bought this painting to hang in our bedroom. Overall we are happy with the quality of it. The colors of the water are slightly different as there is no purply/greyish/blue on the sides of the water, but none the less, it's still very pretty .
You can't really beat 3000 stones, especially for the price. The case keeps them sorted securely and there are a bunch of different colors .
It is a pretty color, but the blue wasn't as light or bright as I was hoping it would be .
Very pretty color. I feel bad because I reviewd the pink by the same brand complaining it didn't cure well (I will have to go and change that review) but after having the same issue with my Gelish brand (which never does that) I think perhaps I need to replace the bulbs in my light .
I thought the color was pretty. A very bright neon pink. However, I do not feel this brand is equally comparable to Gelish brand polish. This seemed to peel off very easily, which is a problem I never really have with Gelish .
We bought these for our LG tv and compared the the glasses it came with these are great.  They don't look as stupid as the other glasses, both the lens and the frame are made better then the LG glasses and they fit kids and adults. My only complaint is that one pair the lens pops out when I clean them. Those were the purple ones my 3 year old called dibs on though so that may be her doing, I'm not sure .
It's a cute design and does look discrete; but that's really the only good thing I have to say about it. Only one setting and it's not very buzzy at all. I didn't have high expectations anyways other than it being a cute novelty type item, which is pretty much all it's good for .
200 glass screens for 20 bucks. You really can't go wrong with that price. Good quality and fast shipping .
I am a new truck driver, I have my very 1st run an ill b gone for 6 weeks so I thought abt buying my husband this hat as a ill miss u gift an something he could use during his truck traning  So I did, I bought it an had a note put on it so he would know I bought this for him. I held my breath an waited for a phn call from him abt the package. The delievery date came up an still No call abt the package  I checked the tracking number an it said delievered. But it was to the WRONG address. So now I have no gift for my husband an I jus lost the money I paid for this hat. Its not retrieveable an now I'm miles away from home very upset I buy a lot off of amazon its my go 2 site over all I'm sure it was nice hat .
this product arrived fast and I just went with standard shipping. the 5 protectors came in brand new condition  as expected, and packed in a  white envelope,  so keep an eye for that and not a  brown envelope or package, they was not bent, broken, nothen. very easy to apply to my lg enlighten. very pleased .
I received this item by the date they had provided me. This is the cases I needed but it's a tad to small and I can't use all the pieces, I only have the rubber cover on it and it's still small it covers enough of the phone but still hands off the sides, I give two stars for fast shopping and the item is what it says but I think it was made for a different phone .
I actually bought two from this company.  They arrived on time and was packaged nicely. They fit our Verizon Samsung tab 2 7.0 perfectly.  The picture does no justice.  The feel of the inside is soft an i like how the inside has a velcro  snap to make sure the tablets are in place, they don't just slide in. It has a magnetic like thing that helps keep the flap closed for when your not using it. I dont know how durable they are but for this price i couldn't pass it up .
I  bought this item for my best friend,  she just got a  new bike and wanted a sugar skull bell but she couldn't buy it her self and it was ALL she talked abt for weeks at work, I  bought this item and it was delivered quickly.  the way it's packed is in a  lil baggy for protection but don't throw the bag away it's also can be used as a keep sake.  this bell is so detailed I  loved it,  and so did my best friend,  she wasn't expecting it bc I never told her I bought her one, until she got it .
I bought this case because i liked the fact that it was a dual protector and stylish.  It arrived on time and was packaged well. I ordered a few things from this company and all i kept waiting for was my phone case (bc i was excited) . I have the Verizon LG G2 and this case was very easy to put on, its not to bulky. This is a big phone to begin with and i was worried the rubber piece would be to big with my phone in it for the hard case to snap on, but it all fit perfect, i am very satisfied with this company and all my products i purchase from them. I recommend purchasing from them .
I have never been a cookbook reader, but surprisingly I loved this one. Not only does it teach you to cook it teaches you how to transform your life into a healthier one. It taught me about the Standard American Diet and how it causes many diseases that people suffer from today. I loved that it taught me not only how to cook delicious meals but also how to be healthier. I was looking for a way to better myself and the foods I ate, and I can say that this book defiantly did this for me. It&#8217;s perfect for beginners, easy to read and very easy to follow the directions it provides. Best cookbook I have read in a very long time .
I have always had problems with my weight and eating healthy. Lately I have been looking for a more efficient way to get the vitamins I need without all the hassle. That when I came across juicing. I had wanted to do this for a while but I never really knew how. That&#8217;s why I love this book. I taught me everything I needed to know about juicing. It makes it so much easier than it would have been. This book not only teaches you how to juice, it also teaches you what to juice. I taught me what ingredients to use to get the most nutritional value. Because of this book I&#8217;m now a juicer and I&#8217;ll never go back .
The 5:2 Diet cookbook is a very wise choice for someone who is always busy. I hate diets because they never work, that&#8217;s why I loved how this cookbook explained to me what a diet is supposed to be. After reading that I was eager and ready to learn. This cookbook provides very delicious recipes that can be made effortlessly. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s ideal for someone who is always busy. Anyone can prefect these meals. This diet plan takes dedication and commitment. You defiantly have to stick with it to see results .
This case is perfect for a slim gummy case effect. It fits very well on my samsung galaxy note 2. I love the feel. Its very velvety and soft feeling  my charger fits in without any hassle. The only downfall is that the case does have a slight smell. It kinda smells like plastic or rubber. Its not really strong. At first I could smell it in the air around my phone but after having on my phone for about 6 hours I only smell it when I sniff the case  other than that this is a great product. I do recommend it .
Being a full time college student and having 2 part time jobs, it is very difficult to stay focused and alert. I have been lacking in the sleep department and have been relying on coffee and energy enhancers. I normally hate relying on anything other than all natural things to give me the energy that i need. So i was super surprised when i found out that this was all natural. Not only have this given me extra energy that i've never had before, but this supplement has made me more alert, more focused and my memory is better than it has been in months. i will never spend another dime on coffee or energy drinks. SO glad i found this holy grail .
i really love this cookbook. It was very helpful for me. It not only taught me how to make many yummy snacks, it also taught  me how to do the paleo diet the right way. I also loved how easy this was. I have a really busy hectic life, so i loved how fast these recipes were. It didn't take anytime at all to make these snacks. It also has great kid snacks, that my younger cousins loved. i'll defiantly be looking out for more cookbooks from them .
I gave it to a co-worker who teaches sixth-graders for a Christmas gift.  She loves it, not only for how pretty it is, but also for the message it carries to remind her how to encourage her students to achieve their best every time she wears it.  It seems well made, and is a very attractive piece of jewelry.  I would highly recommend it to anyone .
I love this product.  A friend recommended it and promised I would see a difference in my nails after one month.  Boy! Was she ever right.  It did not let me down.  I followed the directions from Nail Tek, and it did make my nails much stronger.  I noticed a difference in my right hand in about two weeks and after a month both hands look great.  Everyone wants to know what I have done to get them so long and strong.  I tell them, &#34;Nail Tek.&#34;  It has been 2 months now and I have yet to break a nail.  Thanks Nail Tek and thanks to my friend .
Arrived before expected! Does what is supposed to.  Didn't have to program it. ..bonus!!! Also, the price was cheaper than at the local stores, so I was worried.  It works fine .
it doesn't allow me use the side buttons. It's like it doesn't fit my galaxy s4. you get what you pay for .
I like the way it looks, its multifunctional. I haven't used it yet though. I like the wallet phone case combo .
i think it is a good product for someone who want to play some new techniques.The provided SDK can do lots of things that is suitable for not only research or developing .
Not only do I love the stories but I love writing scripts that come to life with the click of a button! I do wish there were more scenes and clothes to pick from and that I didn't have to wait 4 hours to play a new chapter. All and all I love the app. There are so many possibilities .
This story was definitely different from what I have been reading. Not at all predictable. I've been looking for a different kind of ending and I found it .
"After the Cure" seemed like a totally different story from "The Cure" - different characters, different place with a thread of the first story in it.  I never even found out who was in the hooded robe in the closing scene of the last book. Isn't that what sequels are for? To continue the original story and explain? The grammar and punctuation weren't very good either. I really think they need a new editor, or at least a proofreader .
I thought this one was going to be just a flat documentary book, but after I started the first few chapters, I just kept going and going. The paragraphs are flowing attractively, and the more I read, the more I found the interesting knowledges and ideas within. This is a great true story, and also inspirational one I happened to stumble upon. There are not much sports writings that left me feeling good, energized, intrigued, and eager to try the techniques myself. This one does. I felt grateful and happy for McDougall to be willing to share this good writing .
Not much people can really pin point what really happen during reincarnation (by memory at least), however this book showed a unique approach. Whether it's true or not, the plots of the characters here give me some fresh points of view. It triggers some questions within me, what if that's what happens in this real world ? Each different plots were presented in such a natural way, gloomy or happy ending. The gloomy ones left me feeling relieved, that such tragedy in the character was finally ended. The good ones left me with the soothing feeling, that kept me going through all the circle of the chapters .
I could smell the burning when I turned the mirror on, I opened in up and there were black marks inside. I only had the light on for 15 minutes. I ended up just replacing the whole mirror. I would NOT recommend these replacement bulbs .
I love this lamp, very sturdy, easy to assemble. Does not run hot and its absolutely beautiful! I would highly recommend this product .
I felt that this was a good product. I would have given a 5 star, but I think that the finish could have been a little better.  For the money you can't beat it .
Funny, evocative, inspiring and definitely full of lessons! Don't Forget the soap is a heart-warming recollection about a Filipino family living abroad, and the genuine bond of Filipinos as a tight-knit community. This December, this is the perfect gift to give for the people we cherish!Before I began reading Don't Forget the Soap, my initial impression was, &#34;Oh, this is a book by a well-connected Filipino family. Okay.&#34; I was wrong. The author's family came from humble beginnings, and when I began reading, I couldn't help but smile at the stories that were told within this little gem of a book. I love how the author's family struggled from being the FOB (Fresh Off the Boat) family in a foreign country, and how they made ends meet with what little they had to begin with. This is definitely something I can relate with because my parents started out from very small beginnings as well. This is one Filipino trait that I've always admired - the ability to make ends meet and smile brightly even during the most dire of situations.I also love the stories shared by the author about her mother - truly a woman worthy of love and admiration. She always tries to share with others, no matter what little they have. And I really couldn't forget that piece of wisdom she shared about visiting her older relatives first rather than the more prominent people who wanted to meet her. Seriously, she should be a philosopher or something. She places things into perspective nicely, and I wholeheartedly believe that a lot of people should learn a thing or two from her. Hopefully, this book can help spread her lessons out into the world.While reading the book, the thing that struck a chord the most within me is this quote: &#34;Most graduation keynote addresses have a common message: Do what you love and follow your passion. As inspiring as they are, I can&#8217;t help but think my mother could have a counter speech that might just better serve the majority of those graduating. It would go something like this: Try to find a job where you do what you love but if it doesn&#8217;t happen right away and you have bills to pay, find a job where you&#8217;ll pick up skills and contacts that can be applied to passion projects on the side. You can pursue these at the same time and, who knows, one of them may ultimately lead to your dream job.&#34; This quote struck a chord with me because this is what is exactly what I've been doing right now. I just didn't know it before reading Don't Forget the Soap. Sure, I want to be a lawyer, but I want to be a writer as well. I'm currently working hard to become a lawyer, but I also have book-blogging, which is something I consider as a passion-project. And as a book-blogger, I'm expanding my contacts which I can use when I finally become an author.I also loved reading about the author's Dad. He's one very wise guy, if I may say so. The part where he chose to have his daughter wear something hideous to ward off boys was something I could never forget. It's being protective and it's also brilliant! It had me grinning widely when I was reading it. haha!Personally, I think that a large part of how we turn out as individuals could be attributable to our parents. Sure, we get to decide what happens to our lives, but a large part of our personality depends on how our parents raised us when we were young, so I'd say that parents contribute largely to how we turn out to be in our adulthood. And after reading this book, I have to say that Author Marie Claire Lim Moore is very lucky to have parents like hers. I also couldn't help but be thankful for my parents because I realized how lucky I am to be blessed with such hardworking parents who made a lot of sacrifices just to provide me and my siblings with a decent life.All in all, Don't Forget the Soap is a small treasure hidden within the pages of a book. Read it, smile, and be a little richer after reading, albeit not financially. Heh. A highly recommended read for everybody .
I received this product complimentary of influenster. I am typically an Olay fan so I was excited to get it. The cream feels so refreshing on my face before I go to bed, and when I wake up. It gets rid of my &#34;sleepy&#34; look. It doesn't take much at all to cover your face .
My husband was leaking after his surgery so I purchased a pair of these to see if they work. They are brilliant. He loves them. They have returned his dignity. As far as I'm concerned all men should consider these after prostate surgery. Can't recommend highly enough. It appears they are designed in Australia and I've purchased other Australian products over the years and never had an issue. Wish I could live there .
It's not good I waste my money face it's not clear guality it's not all that  home button it's hard to press .
I got the lite version and it keeps saying this one can't be installed. Love the game though. Any suggestions .
Apple is known for their design and products. So there is nothing to say much. This model became bit outdated but still it full fills all my needs and a best device for a person like me .
I got my touch pad some months ago and It was easy to setup it. But it supports very less video file format and we need to install some other video players if we need to watch all kind of videos. Also there is no expandable memory slot which I felt a big no. Also there is no rear camera as well .
Case is really very good. I loved the way it is designed. Using this case I can keep my touch pad like my tv set and can watch the videos of my choice. No need to hold it in hand. Also it covers my touch pad and keep it safe from any damage .
Strap is uncomfortable and the Strap ring is difficult to operate compared to other helmets I own. Strap is not very long and pulls through the ring when taking off helmet. Not impressed at all. I guess you get what you pay for .
I LOVE THIS PHONE! HOWEVER, AFTER HAVING IT FOR 2 WEEKS IT SHUT DOWN! :( BUT, I DO WANT PPL TO KNOW I BOUGHT THIS REFURBISHED, SO DOUBT THE BRAND NEW ONES DO THIS? IT SUCKS BECAUSE I'M A SINGLE MOM OF A DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED SON WHO IS ALSO A TECHY! SO I AM PRAYING THE SELLER CAN MAKE IT RIGHT. WILL BE POSTING WHAT HAPPENS ASAP! :( ANYBODY READING THIS WHO PRAYS, PLS ADD THIS TO YOUR PRAYER LIST! I CAN'T EVEN AFFORD ANOTHER PHONE AND NEED A PHONE ASAP FOR MY SON'S MEDICAL, THERAPEUTIC NEEDS. EVERYTHING ELSE I've ordered from Amazon has been AWESOME .
Is really nice I purchase this item for my husband and he love it no complain very durable to it protect his phone good .
We bought this for our school camera. Always love transcend products! This one is no exception...will definitely purchase similar products again inthe future .
I bought this when my son was just over a year, after having youtube on repeat forever on Gigglebellies! He loves it and can't get enough. Excellent for kids, colorful, educational and musical!At this price there was not much to think about, i bought volume 1 and 2, and have created CD:S with the songs for the car .
I bought this when my son was just over a year, after having youtube on repeat forever on Gigglebellies! He loves it and can't get enough. Excellent for kids, colorful, educational and musical .
There isn't enough new shows and full house isn't in there so it's not as exiting but I love it .
They are good but fall off after like 4 hours, so don't were them to somewere you are at all day .
When I started reading this book, I was thinking to myself that I could finally relate to a character in these types of books because Sinai is in school like me. So I appreciated that. A lot of these books have characters that are doing all types of things, but forreal, it's hard to find regular people just doing regular things.I liked how all of the people in the story had a place and everyone came together. It just reminded me of real life. Sinai is a girl that you don't like, but you do like her. You know she's wrong for what she's doing, but you can't help but wish you could get away with having any dude you wanted like that.But onto makenzey jade as a writer. This girl is not an amateur. I read the bio in the book and it says she's young which is inspiring. For her to write that great and professional for her age is cool to me because I feel like I can do something like that too. No typos, developed characters, more than I can say about some of the more popular writers I've seen on amazon.Looking forward to what comes next. Will there be a sequel? Because, I wanna know what happens to Armand .
Toby's song is right on track, in fact the Father gave Jesus words of life to speak.  Those words were eternal life, and the moment they were believed the person passed from death into life and would never perish.  John 3:16 .
I have been on zeal for 4 months.  Love what the product has done for me.  My blood pressure has gone down along with some of my weight.  I have stayed full all morning and not snack as much.  I love ordering from amazon because it come to my door .
I enjoyed this book so much.  I felt as though I was there with the Benders in Paradise Valley.  I have so much respect for the Amish people.  We have several families here in Northern Maine, and they have gained the respect for all who know them.  Dale is an awesome author.  It is not every author who can make a book come alive as you read such as he has .
This is the most beautiful book I have ever read. It touched my heart in so many ways. I will never be the same again after reading it .
Though this game doesn't have a great deal of difficulty I really enjoy it.  It's a nice way to unwind and have fun at the same time .
the case looks just as described. For a 15 yr old game it looks good no complaints.  I played various parts of the game including my all time favorite scenes and it checks out great i am happy for this purchase and i plan on buying final fantasy 8 and 9 from this seller if he has them and if the other sellers i ordered them from give me a messed up game. thanks again this one is going back in the vault .
black label, fast shipping very amazing condition, aside from a little water damage to the cover art at the upper left edge nothing noticeable though .
its not as bright as the one that comes with the nzxt phantom but its not dim either so yeah. im not much of a geek when it comes to the guts of a pc but i was able to finger it out in about 45 minutes. im disappointed that i couldn't connect it to the other 200mm fan at the top to turn on the leds with the same button in the rear of the case but it comes with its own switch and i fairly certain i can set it up the way i want if i tear apart the pc further than i did just to install it. but its no biggy im sure you techies can do some crazy s*** setup with the fan .
looks good on my vita fits good. it doesn't cover the edges of the front nor the bottom of the back where the words are but the touch pad and everything is covered. its no biggy I like it ill buy it again .
its cheap and its protecting my vita against bumps and scuffs hear and their and it looks tight in blue.  while it won't absor shock from a significant fall itll protect against 7 yr olds man handling it. it looses a star because you cant hit the volume and power buttons unless you have like long nails or press hard on the buttons. but its no big deal really i recommend this. oh and its easy to install .
its been about 2 weeks now and my tf700t is doing good with the new armorsuit.  The application process is a bit scary cuz u gotta put all this liquid on your tablet before applying the screen protector.  oh and you gotta wait 24 hrs to use the tablet after application wtf is that i gotta wait 24 hrs to see if all this liquid didn't kill my tablet??? nah son!!!  its cool i guess cuz you can take it off and re apply it and it does look good after a few days of setting in. but liquid and tech dont mix and for that it looses a star. if you want to buy this youll be happy with it after the scary process of applying it .
It's a screen protector I don't know what to say. There was no trimming it fit perfectly. the directions were very clear and it came with a plastic squeegee not a piece of cardboard .
Don't you just love a novel that hooks you from the very beginning and will not let you go until the last page? And when the story is over, you pick up another book and it is equally as engrossing. There are lots of books like that. But every now and again something else happens. A different kind of book winds up in your hands. You come across one of those rare creations that will completely turn you inside out and tie your heart in a double knot. And when you've finished reading it, it takes a while for you to recover before starting another book. I finished Televenge a few days ago and I can tell you this--I am still recovering. Pam has the ability to string words together that pierces every emotion in the reader. I found myself laughing over the down home southern humor. I found myself heartbroken and shedding tears by the buckets. I found myself afraid of turning the page, not knowing what was on the other side. But turning the page anyway because I couldn't stop reading. I found myself forgetting to breathe. Pam hits the bull's eye with her blunt truths that she brings to the page. The story takes you beyond normal. Beyond intriguing. Beyond stunning. Televenge is one of those rare creations that I live for .
I had severe lower back pain starting at 10 weeks of pregnancy. I see both a chiropractor and a physical therapist because of the extreme pain. They both suggested this pillow. At first a was not interested, but I am so glad I invested in it!!! I can now sleep at night without the fear of feeling like my back is going to break. I am now 6 months pregnant. This pillow did not magically cure me, but it does make me more comfortable! I love it .
These are toHe best rollers for quic curls, traveling and no fuss. I couldn't believe the flexibility. Toooo cool .
These are the best rollers for quic curls, traveling and no fuss. I couldn't believe the flexibility. Great  stylistic accessory .
Even though some of the info did not apply to my situation I definitely did put some of that information to use and tried it out. Good to keep on hand for reviewing again. Thanks .
WAYYY TOOO THIN. HAIR IS FALLING OUT NOT NATURAL LOOKING THICKNESS AT ALL. Color looks good an shiny but nothing else .
My husband and I recently decided to live better however our old scale died.  We wanted something that was accurate and felt sturdy! Well, this is it. THis scale looks very nice, feels very sturdy and well made, and is very accurate no matter where you place your feet on it .
Bought this for my HTPC.  Needed for keyboard and mouse function and not to control the HTPC side of the machine.  Easy to use and does the job.  Very happy with the product .
Okay Movie I don't really recommend movies.  If you want an okay movie to enjoy for a few hours this isn't bad .
I don't recommend movies, this was okay for a few hours of useless movie watching.  The acting is a bit lame .
The product does not work as advertised. The 3.5mm should be admited from the discription.  Do not buy if you are trying to convert digital to analog sound .
The DVD was in great shape when I got it except that the case had been cracked and bent.  I kept the product because I didn't feel like going though the trouble of returning it when the DVD was not scratched or damaged .
This product is a great economical solution for streaming video.  I have used it for Netflix, HBO GO, YouTube, and cast tabs from Chrome.  The only limitations are the age of the device.  Where it is relativley new not all streaming services support it, but I hope to see and expansion in the near furture.  Also, there is no security so anyone on the network can access your chromecast.  This makes it problematic to use on public networks .
IT WAS VERY DISAPPOINTING TO RECEIVE A BATTERY OF 4400, INSTEAD OF THE ONE ORDERED ACCORDING TO THE ONLINE PRODUCT DESCRIPTION WHICH SPECIFIED 7000 mAH. SO THE CAPACITY OF THE BATTERY RECEIVED WAS ALMOST HALF OF THE ONE PURCHASED ACCORDING TO THE ADVERTISED PRODUCT. NEVERTHELESS, I ENDED VERY SATISFIED FOR THE MERCHANT IMMEDIATE AND POSITIVE RESPONSE TO MY CLAIM. I WISH TO IMCREASE MY EVALUATION TO THREE STARS NOT TO THE ITEM BUT TO THE MERCHANT IN RECOGNITION TO HIS GOOD ATTITUDE .
Love it! Its perfect for my 2 1/2 year old she loves it the more episodes the better and with price you can't fine better .
I like having him in front.  The padded front makes me feel like he's safe. He LOVES biking with this.  Installation wasn't easy, and I wanted to adjust it much further ahead so that I could completely rotate my knees but it wouldn't go ahead far enough .
The other was dried up and didn't even work once.  The bunny one still works and my 13 month old son likes pressing down, but it's too hard for him to do it by himself right now .
Great style and color! Very very comfortable.  My son's favorite shoes so far!  His current pair is 10.5 and I tried to find him an 11.5 on Amazon without success.  When I found a pair 13XW, I ordered it right away (save it for future).We have tried other styles with straps in XW but none of them is comparable with this one. They are all XW, but not as wide as this one and the archs are not as high as this one.  Wish NB could bring this style back .
I looked at some reviews and they said the back of the shoe was loose and it was sliding off the back of their heel and I was worried about purchasing the getta pump. I bought it and when I received them in the mail I tried them on immediately! I was so worried that they would be impossible for me to wear cause I broke my foot and some heels really irritate where I broke it. I tried them on and they fit perfectly. The heel was loose when I got them but if you gently squeeze the top of the back of the shoe it will fit more appropriately to your foot. The toe area wasn't tight and was comfortable to stand or walk in  for long periods of time. What surprised me was the amount of cushion in the bottom of the shoe. It had much more than Aldo and Jessica Simpson shoes. With the cushioning, low heel, and hidden platform this shoe would be wonderful for both "experienced" heel wearers and beginners. The color is the actual true nude color. Its not too pink or too sand. Its also great you can dress this shoe up or wear it casually. I am so thrilled I bought this Steve madden shoe!! And the cherry on top was the low price I bought them for. The only bad thing about this shoes is if you have really wide feet I could see an issue. I wear an A in shoe width and this shoes fit perfect. I might could see the toe being a little tight if you normally get a C width. It does run true to size. But be aware sometimes your heel size is different than other shoes. I wear a 7.5 in heels but 8 in flats. And i ordered 7.5 and it fit just fine. Overall this is one of the best pair of heels I've bought .
I'm pretty sure what Devicewear was trying to do with this case was give an iPad user all the protection and functions as they could while giving them a case that didn't make it heavier or bulkier. The case is great. I have had it for a while now and it works great. Its very well built not alot of signs of wearing. I love it .
Bought this to charge my galazy s3 and minutes after pluging it into my phoneMy phone screen permanently stopped responding I have had this phone for almost 2 years, there is no physical damage to my phone I will never prder from here again .
Its a good product but mine was imported broken.the wood was broken before imported,I belief it was broken because I didn't see any broken piece inside the package and it was well protected,meaning they knew it before sending it to me.Secondly I didnt like the colour its a little dull.Delivery was fast and on time .
just ordered the 22" premium 2 hose hookah (ocean blue), everything was great, shipping came right on time, everything looks great, then on the 2nd day, we decided to clean the hookah, and all of a sudden it shattered on us. I am unable to locate a number to contact for the supplier and am not sure what to do, not happy with the fact that the product shattered on us, i hope a refund or they can replace this for us .
Literally the most painful shoe I have ever worn for fast paced walking. Comfortable to just walk about but not for exercise .
this is a ok Sim game not that far in to it but I see myself loseing a lot of time to it .
I live in UAE, Abu-Dhabi, and it was such a treat to read about adventures happening next door! I have always read about some other big cities- Paris, New York, Tokyo...But now I was almost a part of an international story, having studied 4 years in Dubai, having friends there and obviously hanging out there ever so often!It is a great sneak-peak of the city's life, showing things which aren't visible for tourists or are hidden from the general society, sometimes too conservative to speak out about problems, which are the same as the rest of the world! I think this book is a great break-though for the Emirati market and an amazing chance for people to see Dubai not only as a luxurious shopping destination, where every mysterious Arab is a Sheikh, but another big city, fighting for a place in the spotlight, with its citizens having their own secrets to share!Great job Ameera! Waiting for your next book! &lt;3 .
This product exceeded my expectations! It has a nice fresh sent and doesn't leave you with that &#34;just tanned&#34; smell after using the tanning bed. The color results are great too! I am very pleased .
The ending is horrible. Don't waste your time reading it. The book was an ok read but the ending was a big disappointment .
Download wouldn't work; on the otherhand, the agent who arranged forcompensation did a fantastic job. To be ... &#34;fair&#34; ... I've been a Steam/Valvecustomer for years and the download did work. The game just wouldn't play.I could not find direct contact with them except thru forums (useless attempt)to get a refund or credit.I finally purchased the disk from a local store and even then the game wouldnot play until I changed some of the codes imbedded in the game. Now, this ison PC; I spent over $100 for a game that is less fun than Skyrim and that forcedme to modify it in order to play it .
I Would Recommend This Wallet For Fans That Carry Light . Its Quite Crisp And Takes Awhile To Break In .Does Not Fold Well If Too Many Things Are Added . Its Very Nice And Has Many Slots For Credit Cards And Pictures .
these are cute earrings . I bought them because I have multiple piercings and actually have these earrings as the ones that were used to pierce . I don't have the piercing gun , so I had to break the plastic . the backs are tough to put in , so be careful .
Husband Loves It. He Uses No Other Mug . Good Quality Mug And Should Be In Every Fans Cabinet ... Well Packaged .
Love this game ! Bought this one so I don't lose any pieces . Fun family game . Just be careful not to stain or fold the cards because they are somewhat flimsy .
The tank fits as expected . I don't have a flat tummy and im short so I bought a large . It doesn't fit too snug . The XL  would have been a much lower cut .
i've never received an email from a seller on amazon market place until today from the folks at crazyondigital. i really appreciate how their enthusiastic follow up not only with their product but, the device i got it for. i got this grey and black case that is super shnazzy and at a good price. i think everyone who has the ipad air should too! thank you guys again .
when i got into  Espionage no one really was a good teacher or  an master of spy craft but after reading this book i was a true spy master and a master or every fighting style .
I was concerned about this juicer. There was lots of talk about it overheating.....NOT ONCE!!! We love it and I cannot say enough about it. If you are looking for a quality juicer, get this one .
The toy is great, but there is no place to store the cards. If they would make the plastic part just a little bigger, then you could store the cards and the buttons inside so nothing gets lost and the cards don't get bent .
This toy was the least favorite of the toys that my child received for Christmas. In theory this is a great idea, but in reality they are kind of limiting. If you like blocks like we do, then it is a fun &#34;extra&#34; to have in your block collection. But if your funds are limited, just get a really good block set with lots of blocks. Your kids will then have no limits. Or try Keva planks.....those are way cool .
i bought a nursing scarf from this company and it was a beautiful cotton knit. this is a horrible gauze fabric. i was buying this for a gift for a friend. now i have to return it. not happy at all. don't buy this.  terrible looking and feeling fabric .
I couldn't wait for my book to get here and now that I have it and have flipped through it, I can't wait to get started .
This is perfect for my beach wedding, I can't wait to see it on top of the wedding cake! Excited .
I purchased this drug book to help with clinicals. The main thing i don't like is the set up of it. Some of the drugs that are still on the market are not even in here either. Overall, I do like it and it has been very helpful for clincals and researching drugs .
I received three in a package and you barely touch it and ruin it. Then, it's really cheap but I guess that is what I get for the price it was! I since, have bought a lot nicer one and will never buy this kind again .
A very warm and soft blanket for layering . Not pretty but cozy and more than useful. Can easily useas top and bottom sheeting on cold nights .
Es un buen libro, te muestra el detalle y los verdaderos motivos por el cual uno debe buscar la castidad .
This item was delivered in perfect condition with fill kit. All we have to do now is take it to our local jewelry store for it to be put on a bigger necklace. And that's no problem at all as I knew I would be doing that when I ordered it. Cross design is beautiful. Great item .
I got this exact case for $20 and my friend got the orange one just like it, within less than a week the camo print on the back was already worn off. I'm guessing its because of how its printed on the case, and it doesn't help that I'm a teenager. I believe that the case is and "felt" cheap. I feel like it was a waste of my money and should've spent it on a different case .
problems1. Terrible smell2. Brushes shed3. You can't apply makeup on with theseThey're depend on which one your using either*too hard/stiff even after a lot of wearOr*too softthe brushes also don't pick up the make up wether it's liquid or powderThe only honest good thing about these brushes is the color if you want them for display I guess these are the brushes your looking for .
The trigear output was less than 220 v. So  I can't use it for my so I put it  aside .
its been over 2 weeks and its still not here. I am sure I could give a better rating if i had the product .
This is a well structured book with a clear, scientific thesis to its credit.  The rationale is well built up  and leaves one with the sense that  this is a manageable  process , maybe repetitive  in parts but  not a strain to read and think about.  Unlike many such books  it leaves a thoughtful residue which affects  what one buys  and what one eats.  That is a very good outcome.I could recommend it to friends and those concerned to manage their overall health issues, not just the question of losing weight.It must be a good read as I have returned to read it again several times .
This book is full of facts about the history we have never been told about before of all the once diverse ancient Christianities which were banned and suppressed, only to be rediscovered in the 20th century. This has caused many, including myself, to question &#34;Christianity&#34; as it is being taught and preached to us today.....and surely anyone else who reads this book .
I love my fsm emblem and it has stayed attached to the trunk of my car for over a year now through rain, sleet, snow, and hail. Not to mention many car washes. Definitely worth the cost .
Everything about this product was accurate and it didn't end up being a fake or anything, but I just dislike the bulk that this case adds to the phone .
This movement holder is exactly as described and does a good job. The only complaint I have is on smaller movements, the pins tend to limit your access to the movement. They get in the way a bit, but it's mainly a minor irritation, not a debilitating problem .
fits fine. My dog has only worn it for 5 days and there is a hole and the strap just fell off. He hasn't been tugging or biting it either..mostly wears it supervised and not a very active dog .
Instructions were not detailed or specific and I'd never put one of these together before so it took me a little while to figure it out. It was simple once I did though. Somewhat wobbly, but we don't play too often and just wanted something cheap to keep the keyboard off the floor .
Easy to install and holds both our electric and acoustic guitars no problem. The pegs move to fit any size of guitar neck .
I bought these for the cabinets I was making expecting them to deliver the same soft close as in the Blum drawer slide, which is very good. Problem is that the installation guide does not properly explain where to drill the holes. It says that the distance is 32mm plus the height of the mounting plate, but in their adjustable hinges if they are moved slightly inward it has the same effect as a raised plate. Secondly, even when that is taken into account, unless the door is very wide, it gets stuck on the piston and doesn't close unless it is pushed, which defeats the purpose. To properly install, I placed them 65mm away from the side of the cabinet and now thy work ok,just they are a bit quicker than the drawer slides and the doors with built in blumotion (which can be a good thing). Also, it is worthwhile to get a drilling assembly to accurately drilll the holes at 90 degrees; it can be messy if you don't .
It was fun at first but then it got boring and I couldn't go to level 6. I hate it. I think you shouldn't play this .
this is not a good virus protection app. it will give you viruses instead! download malwarebytes instead. save yourself before you become a victim .
This is currently my most favorite and treasured piece of jewelry and I never take it off. It's not flashy or extravagant, it is simple in its elegance. I get a lot of compliments about the ring from others, as well .
i finish the product but it didn't work at all..i thought maybe by continous using it acne will appear more and will go away after few weeks but instead my face got worse..im so embarrassed to go out ..so dissapointed .
A few good calm songs, a few good hard rock songs that truly kick ass. Think that the world &#34;pop&#34; in &#34;Pop Evil must really be in capital letter. The rest of the album is not bad but nothing more .
i bought this item back in late September and it's already not working. It did work fine for the time being. Just 4 months in i could not get it to show on the TV anymore. I would probably spend a bit more on a more reliable replacement this time around .
This beading board is ok, the lid doesn't work well, my beads easily come out of it which is irritating. The board itself is decent but I would probally buy a diffrent board in the future .
Haven't played this game yet, but I m excited too. The videos look fun. my kind of game for sure .
I love Julianne she is sexy, bubbly and fun. the perfect person to work out with, if you don't know the moves she even has a tutorial thats optional before workout. would buy again .
Im in love with this ring. Would buy again! simple, elegant not too big, silver doesn't tarnish easily. comes with nice box .
Nice set of fiingerpaints. They don't seem full, kind of like air in a bag of chips. But the paint is thick and good for fingerpainting .
This is a super good movie for a great price. Love Heigl, and she didn't dissapoint in this cute movue .
I bought this game for my son, and he loves it. Its fun and not too easy or too diffficult .
I am really out of shape and wanted a video thats got a great stretch routine, this video seemed old and i ididnt even finish it before i decided i didn't like it. I would look elsewhere .
I really love this song. I had never heard her music before, but I fell in love with this song .
it looks like the picture and is as decribed but cheap quality some of the plastic holes are filled in and flimsy. would not buy again .
Great gift for my 4 year old. He loves it and learns at the same time. Its not big and clunky. No complaints .
I love taylor swift annd while her first CD is her best one, this one didn't dissapoint. I would buy it again .
We ordered these mattresses and they were not supposed to be shipped for another 4 days!! Very happy with their early arrival as we are going camping next weekend .
We lost another pair that we have had for years and finally found this very similar pair online. We are very pleased with these new ones and of course after the new ones arrived we located the lost pair(go figure)! Very fast shipping and no hassles what-so-ever .
love the smell, very unique and everyone asks what it is, no other fragrance like it around, totally original, the best ever .
I have tried the Suave keratin treatment and the Agean Oil. NOT THE SAME. Moroccan Oil is the only thing that smooths my hair all day and makes it look shiny and healthy .
Great flavor!!! delicious! I can't stop eat! lolIt's the best flavor of any M&M.;This one won't least a mounth.The seller is great too! fast e fabulous. I recomended!And definitely will buy again .
It ve' been a good purchase...But I don't know if it working...AnywayI like it...I hope it does and I'll buy again .
This phone freezes up too much. Didn't come with an SD Card. Unable to look at some youtube videos that are on Facebook .
Making this super short, bought refurbished and a part of the screen doesn't compleately work all the time, its like a line going down the screen that is unresponsive to an extent .
Well, i bought this headset thinking turtle beaches, they gotta be pretty good. Not the case at all. The right side stopped working entirely the second week mabey and i am very careful with them. Also they come with an echo reduction cord that you have to have in your controller all the time and is super annoying. Last thing is that the cords are a mile long and always in the way. Do yourself a favor pay more to get a better wireless set .
The only thing is i bought mine used and has a spot that won't shut all the way but still nice .
I love this game but you should have to earn the money  not buy it otherwise its so fun to play .
IVE BEEN LOOKING FOR AN INSTAGRAM FOR MY KINDLE AND TJOS ONE RPCKS TBE HOUSE LIKE PKLALHOMA NOT THATA GOOGD THING PEACE OUT .
the only thing i cannot understand is that why this product is such cheap based on the specificationwhich is intel i7, 1GB Nvidia GT630 GPU adn 500G hard drive, i cannot love it more .
Omg this game is super addicting. Can't put my phone down. I would recommend this game to everyone.it was recommended to me and I didn't think I'd like it but I was wrong .
Omg so glad I found skip-bo! This is our #1 game we play when friends are over. Now I can play it whenever I want to and it's a challenge .
Although the episode itself was great,  I expected the episode in its entirety as that is what is advertised.  There are no musical performances and a few skits are missing.  I will not be ordering again.Amazon,  please either make this information known,  or make the whole episode available.  VERY disappointed .
It was great! Not written by Rick, though... can't wait to  the Sadie/Annabeth crossover! I would highly recommend both stories .
Leg Cramps Need Relief ASAP! Above Product Does Not Cut It. Only Quinine Works Whithin minutes. Leg Cramp Pain Can Be unbearable .
Ear pods do not fit as secure & comfortable as featured in the advertised discription. Pods should fit directly into the ear canal. Yes,they do fall out!  DISAPOINTED .
haven't even got it yet so let me know whats up xxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx .
Since i updated it will not play a video for nothing. When you touch a video the thinking circle pops then stops, then lil popup facebook as stopped. VERY AGGRAVATING.....some one should look into it .
Pretty good game. Kinda got stumped toward the end. Had to cheat just a little. The first fourteen levels where smooth, did not get stumped till the fifteenth level .
I GAVE ONE TO EACH OF MY CHILDREN IN HONOR OF THEIR BROTHER AND NEICE THAT WAS TAKEN TO SOON .
At first I was hesitant to read this book because I didn't think it would amount to Ashley Antoinette's work , BUT I was wrong! C.N. Philips definitely has started something that needs to be finished..Prada Plan Protege part 2 is gonna be a banger .
REALLY BAD BECAUSE THIS TONER JUST GOOD TO PRINTED FOR 600 PAGES (DOCUMENTS ONLY, NO PICTURES).  I WILL NOT BUY THIS SAMSUNG TONER AGAIN .
it's another one of these books i just don't get why people keep having to say civilization produced nothing civilization just steals from all these primitive peoples civilization is uncreativeif it is so uncreative then why do these writers keep living in it and producing these books written in western language and printed on civilized machines why not just go live in those places where indians still make their rubber right from the rubber tree and eat their peyoteand dont forget all our modern drugs just come from the indians tooi guess these writers justify themselves staying here in their electricity and gass wramed homes because they can say to themselves that gas and electricity were actaully discovered by the indians and the bushmen and the watusis and whatnotbut of course you wonder why the indians and all gave up all the modern inventions and conveiences that we indulge in but that they of course discovered. it must be because the hallucinations of peyote supply all that they need, their own virtual reality.though of course these writers would just say the indians and whatnot stopped indulging in these conveniences because civilization stole all their lands and possessions. if so, then why are these folks are striving to come up to civilization and get off their drugs and join the rest of us .
now here is some terrific horror all right, this one is done by my master king, its already a classic only twenty five years since it came out, i don't even know where to begin praising it so ill just praise it. you see with the right horror like this you have to have a ground of not-horror, you can't have the whole world just horrible like some sneaky writers do because then you don't have any place to feel whats horrifying and whats not. thats what my professor calls the stability factor. you see, if everythings horrifying then nothing is, it just feels all yucky.this ones a good example of how horrors the new great genre like plays were in shakespeares time, back when they wanted poetic words so the bard had to make all his words that way. now kings like my master king don't have to be all showoff that way because they get to you through the real stuff, his talking straight in language you know since you were in the playground, the point is in the eerie world they make. the words arent there to show off what a great word maker he is and get in the way of the story but to open you right into what youre looking at, the characters and all the tension that develops. that's right, the words are like clear windows. now thats literature, thats what peoplell be reading in five centuries, if theyll even talk of hamlet anymore.i wont give away the story anymore than this, ill just say the scariest thing is when you realize these things get into peoples blood through using computers you start to think uh-oh what if this computer im using lets some creatures in through the screen. talking about computer bugs and bots and viruses. but ill just say go get it and flip right through hundred of pages of gripping gripping scared out of your britches but you always come back to where you are in the end and everything is all right .
This really sucks because I orderd this around september 9.... Its october 31.... Its still not here. Were is it .
I ordered a womans 8... Theese shoes are very narrow i can't even wear em.waist of time and hard earned mulla .
First time buying this.  Not really thrilled with it.  I feel I could have gotten the same results with my usual foundation .
The sides of the headboard were not finished so we had to paint it black.  Needed to drill holes in the legs to bolt to bed frame. It's a little wobbly .
Fell in love with the royal blue dress but the top is cut very low. There were no Crystal-like beads anywhere on the dress that i received.  I was actually looking forward to a little beading, but it is still nice without it.Be careful of the neckline, if you are anything more than an A cup.  The &#34;Girls&#34;  will be quite exposed.  I am a C cup, so I took the dress to a dress maker to see if she could add about 2&#34; to the top for more coverage .
Got the shawl to use with a sleeveless evening gown for a wedding.  This will do nicely.  The chiffon material is nice, has a little weight to it...that's a good thing.  The hems are finished nicely; no lose threads.  Just needs a little steam to take the packaging crease out and I'll be ready to go .
Love it looks great my daughter will love it im sure fit our crib like a champ no complaints whatsoever .
Love it.  It works great, I looked all over the town and could not find this card any were at all .
This is just right for a singer sewing machine starter kit.  The bobbins that come with the set do not fit a brother sewing machine .
I can't tell if this is polyester or cotton and if will fit my sewing machine,  It's okay for the price .
It's great for a starter kit.  I bought many different kits but this is the best for the price the only thing is no thread .
I bought this looking for my first set of Embroidery Thread.  It just does not have enough thread on the spools .
It's not what I thought it was,  It's way to small and got broke trying to put the plastic holders back on the base .
It is poor in sound and is to poorly made.  I bought another one that is made better,  I would not recommend this one to anyone .
These were to be Cotton but they are Polyester, they are cardboard and not round,  so I am having problem trying to get an even stich on my sewing machine .
They look cheaply made and I like the self-Threading needles that you thread on the side not the top.  I give them three stars .
I made the purchase of two power case and one of them does not support full load and the other is not recognized by the phone. both arrived damaged .
I made the purchase of 10 power case and 3 of these were bad, because they do not recognize the phone. to others that these items are a copy of the original. on the front cover is engraved so imitated the original S3 GALYXA name. instead of saying GALAXY S3 .
This is a very attractive ring,looks great on his finger! Not light-weight,very wearable.I would recommend this ring. A great value for the price .
This watch is so worth the money. It is very nice great quality and it looks so nice on my husband. He really loved his birthday gift. Shipping doesn't really take a month is about 2weeks and a half. If you want to surprise him this watch will keep him speech less .
My grandson is afraid of the dark, and when he saw it he said &#34;Oh Mimma I really wanted this-- No I REALLY wanted this.. Priceless .
I think John Pinette is a riot, I've seen him live and gave a great show. Own many of his dvd's but can't obtain the one that has the Chinese Buffet so I am thrilled to at least listen .
It's a fun game with lots of flash, color and sound. However, I have to repeatedly quit playing after just a few minutes because there is a limited number of lives. I don't wish to have to contact my Facebook friends in order to continue playing. An annoying drawback to an otherwise fun game. I wish I could play it for longer periods of time without having to quit .
I like the game even though it is not my favorite game in the whole wide world but thank you for making the game .
Shipping was quick and came in a timely manner with good packaging. The cables don't have a locking mechanism, but they have a snug fit and don't feel like they're going to fall out. The only issue I have is that the image shows a cable without a 90 degree connector. The assumption is that both cables are as pictured, however one of the cables had a 90 degree connector on one end. Not sure if this is intentional or somebody grabbed the wrong one off the shelf, but the second product image kinda looks like a 90 degree connector. It wasn't a big deal for me, both cables installed just fine, but it might be something to keep in mind if 90 degree connectors won't work in your application .
This is a great product. The casing has a rubbery finish to it which makes it very nice to the touch and easy to hold onto. The iPhone itself is quite slippery so it really helps reduce the chances of dropping the phone. It also adds bulk which can be a pro or a con depending on your preferences, but because I have large hands I like having the extra bulk to hold onto while typing. Best of all it charges your phone on the go. I can go a whole day with extensive use of the mapquest navigation app and even after a whole days' use with the app (probably around 3 hrs of drive time) along with texting and calling I can come home with my iphone still at around 50% battery life. That's just insane. And on the days when I don't use my phone much I end up coming home and the case is barely at 50% meaning I could probably go another full day without a charge.Have yet to drop the phone (knock on wood) but even in the event of a drop the case looks very sturdy and capable of protecting the phone .
Fast, able to handle gaming and engineering solid models. I purchased this on my newest PC build with intent for high end gaming with occasional SolidWorks use in Nov 2012.Pros:1. Easy install2. Looks awesome (my PC has a clear section on the case. These help the "why is that not in outer space" impressive appearance)3. Very fast4. Never been able to max it out yet (even with highly graphics modded Skyrim.)5. Still expandable to 32 if your running extensive video and higher level Windows 7 or 8Cons:1. Still a bit price heavy, but I got them Black Friday so no issue for me .
I researched 10+ different iphone battery cases and this ex-era is the best no doubt. All the other similar items on ebay have lower grade cells that compose the battery pack. Lower grade as in not having the actual amperage that they say they have in them and being a low quality impure lithium product that results in much lower performance and lifespan.Also the circuitry that is built in this ex-era case is much more superior. Which ensures proper charging and discharging.This case beats the mophie (80.00 at best buy)because ex-era system comes with a dual charger, and 2 battery pack, basically triple your iphone battery life. No battery case can beat it .
this processor is just like the other amd fx chips, it does NOT have a throttling issue! you simply see it go to 1.4ghz if your system is not running any programs, but you can make it 4.0ghz all the time, just change power settings in the bios, ie, cool n quite and the c settings, also change power settings in windows and you should no longer see the "throttling"UPDATE. My hard drive is a slow one from 2008. it is bottle necking my system and causing my whole system to perform worse! also my video card is the GTS-250 1GB and may also be slowing things down, all else is up to date.... So when i get a faster harddrive and better video card i will update this to show just how much better this cpu is than the 1055T and fx 6100, as those were my previous AMD processors. but in my opinion if anyone has the 1055T it was what i wish I had and stuck with the whole time. but not getting the 8120 or 8150 was the smart choice i did make! the 1055T was a BEAST but the fx-6100 was the BEST overclocker, got it up to 4.7GHZ @ 6cores and 5GHZ @2 cores. the stock power of the 8350 will make you feel good if you do not have liquid cooling for overclocking. I have liquid cooling and with it you will be happy with any of these processors.stick with the 1055T if you already have itgo with the fx-6100 if you love overclocking and have liquid cooling (and you are a cheap) don't let the stock clock make you think this is better than the 1055T!!!go with the 8350 if you do not already have the 1055T BUT if you want the 8350 and have comfy money for it , get it, ifnact the best amd fx is the 8320 @150 dollars.... but this is a cost ratio, so get the best processor to suit your budget and tech wants.im not an intel guy or amd guy, i am a price guy, and the 8350 hit the spot for me and i have done research with the 3 different CPUs. compare to intel? heck no those cost too much and are not worth the quality increase that is if there is any for real world use anyway! i wish i had known all of what i do now, i would have stuck with the 1055T, and got the 8350 when the price hit around 150 dollars, other wise price per money, get the 8320. my research will save you from spending money on a cpu that does not fit your tech needs, face it, all these cpus do what you will need, but you want to be the next god among your friends with this new cpu purchase!ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW.........The only problem i had with this was it needed a fresh install of windows 7.... saw a huge increase in performance and i am working to make sure i see it the whole time i use this processor, one person somewhere said it was not any better than the 6100, fact is it sometimes performs about the same, but is capable of a lot better performance. Like i say, i just need time to figure what the settings should be. So far, the 6100 hundred cant even perform equal at a full overclock. the 8350 0n stock is a real treat in itself! and the odd thing is how you change no settings only a reboot and the performance drops to the 6100s level. I am seeing this as being the reason why intel fans hate this cpu line as it is not fluent in its highest performance.......... but in the future i am optimistic about .I dont go by benchmarks, i go by what i saw for the programs i was using and how consistent the programs ran each time i booted my computer for a use with unchanged settings.this processor is surely capable of more than what i have, as i have seen its promise even without the hotfix installed as of nowhowever if you are looking to build a cheap pc , go with the 6100, but if you want the best there will be, the 8350 is a great idea . for its cost increase it was easily worth it for me .
I purchased this Maxboost hybrid about 2 weeks ago, after spending hours researching other alternatives. After reading multiple reviews about Mophie which indicated that many suppliers are unwittingly selling fake Mophies, as well as reviews indicating that Mophies have a tendency to break pretty easily, I went with the Maxboost. I wanted something easy to use, lightweight, and reliable. What I love about the Maxboost is that you can take the battery off and leave the shell case on your phone. This is easy to do. The shell case fits perfectly. The case is essentially flat on the front of the phone, so if you are looking for &#34;bumpers&#34; to help prevent damage to the glass surface, keep searching. I hate bumpers because they get dirty around the edges and make it hard to get your phone in/out of your pocket. What I love about this charger is it quickly replenishes a depleted iPhone battery. So, rather than plugging my phone into the wall, I just attach the battery and in less than an hour my phone is charged up. I don't carry mine around all the time very often, but when I do it's great because it looks nice and it fits easily in your hands. It does add a bit of weight to the phone but it's not bothersome to me at all. I have not yet synced my phone with the battery attached so I cannot attest to whether that works, but I have no reason not to think so. All the other reviews indicate syncing is not an issue. I also really like that you can buy different color cases. I will say that the red color I bought is about 3 shades lighter than it appears in the pictures - I wanted a deep, dark red and it's more light red, almost orange in color. Other than that, absolutely no complaints and I definitely recommend this product for anyone on the go, on conference calls all the time (like me) or anyone who travels a lot where you need extra battery life .
I rated this 5 stars due to the fact that I had had a larger size Kong before and it was able to stand up to my Huskys' play.  This was a dog that could destroy anything within 5 minutes.  Except his Kong toy.  I got the puppy Kong for my american eskimo/husky puppy and she loves it!  Keeps her occupied for hours.  The only problem I have now is keeping the cat from stealing it and hiding it.  She loves it too!  My only complaint, if you could call it that, is that they don't give you a choice of colors.  My dog is a female, and although I'm not sure how well dogs can tell colors, I would prefer that I was given a pink one instead of blue.  Minor complaint, I know.  Otherwise this far exceeds any other toy she has .
It has one flaw though, it needs a door.  Also, not a complaint, but, if you do get one, take into account how tall your dog is standing on her or his back legs and allow for that .
This toy is almost as good as the puppy kong! It keeps her occupied when the kong toy isn't being used (have to switch out toys sometimes so they don't get bored!) and is also helping with her teething .
I would rate it higher, but the wheel for it is made of plastic.  Won't last long at all if you have a dog with any kind of strength.  They get going on the trolley and that thing will break when it hits the end if they have anything besides a fast walk going on or if they pull really hard.  I had to go to the hardware store and buy a metal one .
OK, yes, I was looking for a sci-fi book and ran across this one. Not my usual genre, but it looked good, so I am please to say that I am not a fool and actually bought a great book. Ha .
The Bestduplicator has been exceptionally easy to use and super reliable. It has never failed me. I can't thank you enough .
Recently one of our cats had started to show interest in our utility closet. Laying outside the door at night. After the second night, my husband went to investigate and found 2 mice sitting on a hammock in the closet. With me being an animal lover and vegetarian for over 20 yrs, he already knew that there was no way we were going to kill those little guys. I couldn't find any humane traps in the area, so I found this product and decided to try it. We put the traps out and have caught 3 mice in less than 24 hrs. 2 within 30 minutes tonight. I smeared a VERY thin coat (barely visible) of peanut butter in the back of the trap to lure the mice and used banana flavored instant oats for the bait. It worked perfectly! Luckily, we have a park about a mile away where we've released them with some oats. The trap is so simple to use, no need for contact with mice. Negatives to this product are: Its made with very thin plastic, and has small ventilation holes. So they need to be checked often to avoid the mice chewing their way out or suffocating. It is pricey, but well worth it .
Terrible movie. All star cast, but extremely dissapointing. Had high hopes, but didn't get a single decent laugh, and neither did my wife .
One of the best shows on TV! Never miss an episode and I'm never disappointed. Well worth watching from beginning to end .
I love the gold heart dangle earrings. I was disappointed in the packaging. The fine gold chain on one of the earrings was in a knot. I tried  to untangle the chain, but I could' not untangle the chain, so I wear one shorter than the other .
I bought 2 pieces and shipped it all the way to Saudi Arabia (the shipping cost a bomb) upon receiving it and setting it up, i soon discovered that I was sent 2 pieces that didn't have the backlight !!!!!!Product isnt too bad, but not getting the backlight (even though i paid for it was a total bummer .
This radio is advertised to work for the new iPhone 5...however you have to buy an adapter for it to work. If you have the older versions than this radio will work well. Got this as a gift and had to return it due to the fact that it does NOT work with the iPhone 5 without said adapter. When I looked up the adapter it was roughly $15 .
I got this as a gift for my mother and half of the lights did not work. Was not impressed .
It was the wrong one. Did not fit the front bank of my 2000 Nissan Maxima. So I had to purchased the right one locally .
This bag is perfect for my many travels this summer with my little toddler! I search online tillI found this bag; the size is great and its very stylish. However, there it is labeled as &#34;CA prop 65.&#34;I've never purchased anything with this label. The state of California has proved that this productcontains chemicals that cause cancer and fertility issues along with birth defects. Being that I am 7 weekspregnant and plan to use this purse daily, I've decided to return it. Other than that It was perfect for me.Makes me wonder what else should or has this label on it .
My husbsnd suffers from edema and neuropathy in lower legs from car accidents. As a personal trainer on his fit 12+ hours a day, he won't go to work split hour these socks! Thank you, amazon best deal .
The cover is rough, the freckles on it shed. Guess you get what you pay for, won't buy this again .
Not all that impressed with this for the price.  The only way for the fan to run is plugged into your computer so the battery is getting twice the pull .
The manual was just what I expected.  Not a shop manual, but has what I need for taking care of my car .
This has been a really good case for me. The stand works great for me. I haven't had any problems with the magnet being to strong, everything has worked great for me. I know there are cheaper cases out there but I'm a firm believer that you get what you pay for. If your willing to invest hundreds in a tablet then you might as well pay a little more for a case that will actually last and protect it. I love it. It has done everything you would need in a case .
I like to start off by considering the fac that it is free to watch as a prime member thanks! and also it is viewable in HD i can not beat it .
We needed a product that would fill the expansion joints in our basement floor so that there would be a smooth surface for the carpeting to go over.  It worked great!  We should never see any indentations through the carpet.  I would highly recommend this product .
We were hoping that this would make the water tolerable, but it didn't.  This would probably work fine if you don't have a LOT of iron;  we do and it just didn't remove enough.  We even had a whole house filter before it.  It was terrible for drinking and we incurred stained sinks, toilets and even laundry; therefore, we had to go back to a water softener .
Works better than the original charger that came with the phone!!!! My phone was charged in no time after being completely drained .
Super super super super super fun very addictive  can not stop playing it very very very funI would definitely recommend this app to you get it .
These are by far the best nursing pads on the market!  I have been nursing my daughter for 11 months now and have used numerous different nursing pads trying to find the best fit and these win hands down.  They are extremely absorbent and stay in place.  My order got to me in no time at all .
Didn`t no them in Denmark, but how they can play and sing. Hope they will go here for concerts maybe in the festival season .
It was exactly what I was looking for. It is nice quality and soft. For being one big clip, it is perfect for a layer of color that isn't permanent (: I highly recommend this product. Plus it's not extremely expensive so it is well worth it! You won't be disappointed .
I like this book because it makes me feel happy joy full and  sleepy  you should read it and love it have a great time reading if you don't like it please, please return it just read it.love Amia .
I ordered this because I decided to get a gym membership and get back into shape. It fits true to size and the support is incredible. My boobs didn't move an inch when I jumped around. However, I'm returning it and giving it 3 stars because the shape looked terrible on me. It was too wide and flattened my boobs in the center by pushing them out to the sides. I looked embarrassingly wide and flat. I'm very narrow and close-set, and this just didn't work for me at all .
This is another great shape from Cleo. I wear this, the Marcie, and the Lucy all in a 28G. It runs true to size and creates a really nice upfront and projected profile. I was tentative to try the Lily because it's based off the Meg, which is a notoriously difficult fit, but Cleo made great improvements to this style. I would be hesitant to recommend this to anyone who is very full on top or very full on bottom though. They may not be able to fill out the top or may experience cutting in along the top. It works well because I'm evenly shaped .
Since I ordered it for only $25, I'm not too concerned about the small issues with it. The cups run a size small, so I ordered a 28GG, which is one size up from what I wear in the Lucy and Marcie. It's the correct size, and it fits fairly well. However, I dislike how thick and stiff the padding is. It's similar to the Freya Deco, padding wise. It also gives a slightly more wide front profile than the Lucy or Marcie. It makes my boobs appear a bit larger than they are, which isn't something that I look for in a bra. Despite the little problems with it, it's a nice basic and will be great for spring and summer .
The Chronicles Of Trellah, Is a genuine page turner.  It will keep you guessing til the end.  The adventures of Sophina, a smart witted,seemingly fearless young lady that will stop at nothing to get her brother back.  The many characters in this book keep Sophina on her toes at all times, sometimes getting her into trouble.If you are a fan of Hunger Games or Harry Potter, give Chronicles of Trellah a go...I truly recommend it for kids and adults alike.  My daughter has read it twice and loved it.Can't wait to see what other adventures lie ahead for Sophina .
it did nothing but put the same picture up of the fish with a tenn hat and sunglasses it does nothing .
I LOVE the new Dr. Phil book. It came hard cover in great shape and quicker than anticipated! I am happy with any of his books but this truly is not your mama's world and we do need to be made aware of baiters and users! Way to go Dr. Phil .
These bars arrived quicker than anticipated but for my preference, were not very tasty. I kept in mind the nutritional value of the bar as well as the high protein content and low carb for certain activities that I wanted to use them for. Mostly I used them for recovery. The flavor was not coconut but just a bland tasting chewy substance.  They weren't untolerable but I just had to tell myself they were beneficial and will definitely order Quest again, just a different flavor .
These running shoes arrived earlier than expected and were ready to go! No break in period!! I have worn EVERY brand of running shoe and I am very impressed by the quality, comfort, support and feel of these runners. They are at the top of the list and my feet need specifics. They do not bother my achilles or my plantar faschiitis which I am both prone too and they also helped with my hip stability due to the smoothness of the stride of the shoe. I will be ordering another of the same next time the price is right as well .
I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking to increase their protein intake for fitness activites pre and post workout for their efficient fast absorption. Using this product guarantees you are absorbing all the nutrients and building components that protein should provide but does not in food form.  Excellent results and you feel differently after using for a couple of days. Very good investment .
Just getting into essential oils, this does the job of holding them all, nothing fancy very functional.I guess if you have more than 24 you have too many .
Good razor, only complaint is that shiny chrome gets slippery when wet, but it works well.Careful when shaving the chin area, small cuts result no matter how careful you are .
I reted this 5 stars because of the ease in installing. It certainly met my expectations. No cutting required. Finally a product that is easy to use .
I guess you get what you pay for. This wasn't like a study guide at all. It was just some practice questions like 20 for each part of the test. And you they gave you a,b,c,d answers but you couldn't even try and see if you knew the question because the answer was in a different color so you didn't know if that was what you were going to pick because you already saw the answer .
No one can even sit down on the couch without it coming out and looking like it is just thrown on there. Not what i expected at all looks so nice and tightly fit in the picture, not how it works when you get it on and by the time I got them and got them on it was too late to send them back .
We have always been Sony buyers, but this Visio is the best electronic purchase we have ever made.  It is everything Visio says it is and more. You can't really appreciate the awsome picture until you see it. Thank you Amazon for carrying this product at a very competative price and your superb delivery service.  Can't wait to buy one for our bedroom.  Would highly recommend this Visio M-Series to all TV watchers .
Unable to put down until finished!  Definitely 5 star!  Nothing like an emotional roller coaster ride!  Can not wait for next book .
I usually avoid books which feature the authors name in larger print than the title. However, Laura Lippman blew me away with this fascinating story. I couldn't put it down! I suppose I'll remember to not judge a book by it's cover in the future .
I'm just used it first time,the motor out burning smell ! I think I won't use again!Waste my money .
Great phone from what I can see. I use no contract service but I purchase unlimited. For this phone you have to have a contract. So I have to return it. I will be buying again from Amazon, service was great .
I was upset that it was impossible to watch movies on other apps because the wifi connection was bad or what ever. But with netflix, that is no problem .
I bought the tortoise gt sunglasses and after having them for a few weeks, I am very disappointed. At opening, I was very excited because they looked great and the metal piece holding the lenses seemed reliable. I noticed some lines across some parts of the plastic frame, but I didn't think much about them. In less than two weeks, one of the legs of the frame broke off! I didn't even apply much pressure. I placed it on top of my head, and while I lifted it off, it just fell apart. I wanted these to be sunglasses I didn't have to be worried about breaking but something that could hold up during the summer. These weren't it .
It's cheap and not made well, it keeps coming off and I've already lost the back of one of them, they don't grip the phone very well but for $.01 and free shipping I'd buy it again and again and again and again .
It's simple and made cheap, the tablet slips out of the adjustable grips sometimes so I don't trust it all the time. It is what it is and it's better than nothing at all .
I love this watch, even though it is bigger than I thought it would be.  I have had it for a couple months now and the gold tone is starting wear off already, which is why I didn't give 5 stars .
&#128522; love it baby can't  complain  I bought it to big but it works fine ! Thank you guys order your shirt size .
This book contributes nothing new to advance my understanding of plastics processing, I was disappointed to see some sections shorted when a more detailed discussion could have been provided. Some topics I feel are important were skimmed over in a paragraph or so.This book would be good for a new student (less than 3 years experience) that wants an 'overview' to plastic processing .
Purchased this unit for the dry winter months, The first thing I noticed was that the &#34;medicine tray&#34; is just a molded in cup to the top screen of the unit, very disappointing to see sunbeam would actually market this. This unit has no way of controlling humidity levels, it will run constantly under two selections &#34;high&#34; and &#34;low&#34; until it runs out of water... The fact that this unit boils water to raise humidity levels make it very inefficient, I found it much more practical to boil water on the stove to humidify my small one bedroom apartment.After about 5 hours of running, I found that this unit only raised the humidity of a small room by 10%, (tested using a mechanical hydrometer)This unit would be good for a small bedroom that is has few or small windows, and very low air flow .
The product was pretty.  The fabric was very nice and looked great.  Ther control was cheeply done.  simple on/off button (which was fine), however doesn't work very well.  At times, would have to turn on/off numerous times before would start working.  Have had it since Oct 24, it still works, and we still use it.  Control just aggrivating at times .
It didn't work the way it said it was supposed to.. I could have bought it cheaper at the drug store .
I have read a number of complaints about the packaging flaws on this item, yet I was naive enough to believe the issue was likely to be fixed by now. Buyer beware...that was not the case. Not only was the packaging glue stuck all over a number of disks, most of the disks looked like they had been used as toddler toys. Bran new disks should not look like they have been slid across pavement. Some even have chips in the edges! I didn't have much trouble getting the disks to play at first, but at about season 5 I started having all kinds of trouble. I have had to skip about 10 episodes because they simply will not work in any player of any kind. Of course, by the time I got to that point, it was too late for me to contact a seller with a complaint or do anything about it. I have a hard time believing these disks were bran new when the series was recorded on them. I would have to be a fool to think otherwise .
I have a terrible back acne problem for over 10 years, and have pretty much gave up on it because I'm tired of spending 100's even 1000's on stuff that doesn't work or works for only a limited time frame.Idk why i haven't tried this earlier but apparently it works for my back acne. I'm not trough my 5th lbs and 2nd bottle of vinegar, and i apply it almost every day before going to bed unless i'm too tired to go trough process.I mix 2 spoons of clay and add vinegar until i get a paste in a porcelain bowl (mixing it with fingers you are anyways going to apply it).I apply a layer on my back and even though i thought it's not working after two weeks my acne started to clear (i apply it to my face too just for the heck of it even though i have no face acne). After applying wait 20 min and then jump into shower. this part is messy but it's a shower. I applied it over 30 times and had no problems with the drain. don't try to rub it of just stand under a shower and it will come of in 2-5 minutes. i like to take long showers so after 10 more min there is almost no mud left in the shower. maybe people who force large amount of it had problems with drains but if you let water do the work i'm sure you'll be fine (don't forget that i cover my whole back and i'm 6 3' and 180 pounds)Anyways this works and i would recommend it to everyone that has a back acne problem, just be patient and results will come .
I read other reviews and thought that i'll get a code right away. 1 day and no email, so i have to wait to see if it will be delivered at all .
Does not fit 2005 Audi S4 convertible as a break light. If you are looking for it Sylvania 7225 fits .
Matt Stone has literally changed my life, not just with this book but with all of his ideas and research that Ive seen.  I hope he succeeds in getting the world to give up their ridiculous ideas about food, diet, exercise, weight loss, metabolism, etc. and start trying things that actually work .
I love these books with Gabriel Allon!  This one does not disappoint!  Twists and turns like you have not read before .
It keeps leaking!  The water tastes good.  It was easy to install, just don't know why I can't get it to stop leaking .
When you need a pick me up to get you to the next meal, eat one of these tasty, satisfying bars.  They really hold my hunger when there are no other options;  traveling, hiking, etc.  Try these if you can't eat peanuts .
The 2600 has to be manually operated. When I first set it up, I swear it would automatically place the time in column 1 and the next box over or when the clock goes past noon, it would place the pm out date right nex to the in time. I contacted customer support and ther person helping me had me reset the unit. After that evry time the an employee wants to clock in and out it all has to be done manually. If you pay a little more money and get the next model up, you will be happier I think. By the way, I called back to customer service tech help several times and anyone helping me after the first person didn't seem to know anything about the 2600 .
I love this pot to make tea in.  It does not drip, which is why I bought it in the first place.  This new one is a replacement. It's great .
I bought this to wear to up up coming wedding. I am pleased with what I received. I quality is not cheap .
One day I came across diner dash, so I figured I would try it out. Once I started playing, I could not stop. I love all of the diner dash games. They are addicting .
Works just like any 30 dollar armband would work I love it & it has improved my gym life by not having my phone in the way all the time .
I mean I've had better headphones but these are good I like the fact they have the little remote on the right string other than that never regretted buying them .
Not cheap looking at all in person. It's been a few months since I bought this & nothing has fallen off very secure & definitely worth buying .
It's so cute in person! I've had it for a few months now & the top flower came off but nothing like a lil super glue won't fix! I don't recommend putting your phone in your back pocket or any pant pocket with this case on lol .
This type of material gel gets dirty pretty fast it's so cute the color but wish it wouldn't get dirty the way it does .
Just like in the photo & they're gel cases I love it. I bought a few other colors & I couldn't resist .
I couldn't be any more happier with this purchase I've had it for a few weeks now & only put it on my phone for when I go somewhere fancy to preserve the detail of it. Whoever came up with the idea to make such a damn cute case THANK YOU .
it fits good and looks good the covers they send do not fit good they bubble .
From the pits if Sweden, graveyard emerged from a place inside blues,rock,and folk at the same time. The band has such a blend of talent they can't keep hidden for to much longer. Just one of life's simple musical masterpiece thank you .
What's better then free books? Nothing. If you don't like the book, it's not a big deal because you didn't pay for it .
It's cute and addicting. I like it a lot. I don't want to write more words, what's with the rules .
All you need is 1 9V battery and it finds the coolest things anywhere. We took it to the beach and found items worth cashing in. Rocks, Silver, or Gold even on our trips to the Mauntains. You won't regret buying one .
I don't like paying the full price for items if I can't find a better deal else where, I got lucky finding this brand on amazon. It was a gift for my mother in law, something I did right, for once .
Downloaded the improved DMPlus app. Complete shambles. Now been 3 hours and still struggling to make sense of it. Want my sub back!! NO STARS IF I HAD AN OPTION .
I collect babies from all over the world,  but I didn't have Hawaii  ,I really like my Barbie doll, and I'm an old head with a young heart........I would recommend this doll  for any Barbie collector out there .
I purchased this for my daughter, not only does it work great,  she finds it very soothing to watch the water. I would recommend this product..and the price was not bad .
well Ive been looking for a size but its not here - i would love if u help me to find my size & its cause its my christmas presentim looking for Jordan retro 13 size 7.5 .
Was not disappointed in it. Never read a Dannielle Steel book before. Will be looking at her books from now on .
I didn't get the part I ordered. I received a stock charging latch not Even close to the one pictured or described .
Hard to tell the front from the back, very hard to serperate from edge. Would be nice not to have to cut lable out. Would not buy again .
Battery is not holding it charge my laptop keeps telling me consider replacing battery I trying to return it thanks for nothing .
I got the phone on time but a week after having it the phone stopped working. Found out it had previous water damage. So had to buy another phone! Not happy with this purchase at all .
I love this necklace becausr it's a simply cross that you can wear with anything ! I also keep getting good complements on it. But the only bad thing about this necklace is that it broke a week after I had start wearing it. I was just sitting there doing nothing and it just fell of my neck out of the blue. And the part that broke was the main peice you us to connect it. Now it is just harder to connect it in the back, but I deal with it because I love the cross .
Still the best. Used it for twenty or so years and nothing comes close. Small amount goes far, saves money in the end .
Just as expected, classic scrubs hilarity, product was delivered fine and promptly works, ighg day on episode changes but assuming that is by manufacturer and not amazon .
Garbage. Cord did not work. Tablet does not charge. Not happy with the product. This is a problem for me .
Bought this pair of shoes from Academy. Used them for work because my other shoes kept giving me cramps in my feet. I used them for almost a year and the concrete surface I wear them on has worn them down and needed a new pair. I have had no problem with these shoes. They have been wonderful to wear. I couldn't find them in a local store so I went online. I was very happy to order another pair. I don't usually like paying a lot of money on shoes but these shoes are worth it. The only shoes I wear for work now .
We get this jeans but they are not low rise and not Straight. They're high rise and slim. In general quality is good though fabric is rather thin. Maybe it was a mistake of Amazon who shipped us another item...As we cannot return them now, my husband can wear them but feels a little bit disappointed as expected another model .
I purchased these lanyards as gifts for my grandson and his friends.  They loved them and liked to wear them with theirpocket knives on them when we went out in the woods hunting and exploring.  The very first day, the hook on two of thelanyards came apart.  The seller sent us replacement ones and I hope that they last.  The lanyards are great but the hookhardware is very cheap and does not last.  Seller is easy to work with and very helpful .
This headset was incredible in every way compared to the headsets of my past! I was only sorely disappointed when after only having them for a little less than a year, the plastic holding the ears to the headpiece snapped. Clearly these weren't made for big heads .
Not quite as dark of a red as is shown in this picture. The steering wheel cover would not fit over my steering wheel despite being advertised as &#34;meant for a PT Cruiser&#34;. The set itself was EXTREMELY difficult to assemble and honestly if I could, I wouldn't have bought it in the first place. Just like in the image though, the floor mats are a completely different shade of red and make me wonder why they didn't just pair this set with black. All in all- it was ok for the price, but I would advise against purchasing this set .
If you are not a Pepper fan, what can I tell you? They are a fun loving, 420 friendly, p*ssy loving band. They are kind of Ragae, Ska with some punk notes thrown in. You can rock out, as well as chill out with this one. If you ARE a Pepper fan, then you need this album just like ALL of their albums!!!LONG LIVE PEPPER .
Hello all,I got this little guy to go with my De'Longhi EC155 15 Bar Pump Espresso and Cappuccino Maker. My espresso machine is on the small side, so I had to find something that would work for its size- this is perfect!!! It works great and clean-up is a breeze. I highly recommend this one folks! Thank you .
Okay, so there are some issues with this one. The main one being the size. You will have to be careful of what size milk steamer container you purchase- the big ones will NOT fit in this little guy. BUT I just put mine up on a pedastool (lucking coffee maker- LOL) and it works very well. I use shot glasses when making my espresso and it works perfectly. It does not have an automatic shut-off, so you will have to keep an eye on your espresso and make sure it isn't geting too watery.I LOVE mine!!! I have had it for over a year and a half and have NEVER had an issue with it. Easy to clean, easy to use and GREAT results! If you have never had an espresso machine before (this is my first) this is a GREAT place to start! Cheap- compared to most other machines, works AWESOME and makes super yummy espresso drinks!Thank you .
This is lovely but we have not been able to use it as a lamp because my husband accidently forgot to check the box and threw away the lighting mechanism- OOPS! It is still lovely and we keep it out on the table to look it. If you gets yours and it appears to be wet- don't fret, I talked to the importer and this happens. It is just some of the stain that they use for the base. Simply wipe off the excess and you are good to go.P.S. This guys customer service was AWESOME!!! He is VERY helpful, courtious and replies VERY quickly. Thank you sir .
LOVE IT! Thought it didn't work because it took about 15 pumps before it started working, but works like a pro! Thank you .
I read reviews and thought that this product can without added salt or sugar. I was mistaken. I'm not super picky about that- but I know it is very important to those more health conscience than I.Other than that, it tastes GREAT! came super quick and their is no extra floating oil- very well mixed and very smooth & creamy .
Works great and helps me to keep my bathroom organized. I am NOT an organized person when it comes to my personal space, so I can use all the help I can get! Packing was very good and shipping was SUPER fast! Thank you .
I rock out to this all the time! I may be a dinosaur but I still love having the actual CD in my hands. I like the process of downloading it and uploading it and then I can still take it with me in the car- without having to upload my iPod. There are a few songs that I don't love but nothing that I can't stand, I'm happy! And the other songs I LOVE!!! Thank you .
I have had my decal on my iPad for over a year and I have not had any issue with it AT ALL! Granted I had a clear case over it most of the time but even without it on, I never had any issues. High quality decal here folks!!! AND it is from one of my favorite childhood books- WIN-WIN!!!!! Thank you .
I haven't used these little beauties YET but they are lovely and look like pearls! I am planning on using them for makeup looks, art projects and nails! Excited to get playing around .
I order these on the large size and I'm glad I did, as they fit perfectly as they are. So if I would have gotten my &#34;correct&#34; size it would most likely be snug. They are lovely though and more of a skin-tone color than an off-white I was expecting. Very comfortable but I have to be careful what I wear them with, because as I said, it looks like I'm not wearing leggings at all. Super fast shipping and good packaging! Thank you .
I wasn't sure what to make of this book at first. It started a little slow but the storyline quickly developed and the characters emerged  and soon I couldn't stop reading...I just had to know what was  going to happen next .
Speechless...fabulous....addictive...must read more :) I cannot wait to read the second book.  I am dying to see what happens between them .
This is a great book...roller coaster city, emotional...but WOW!!! I can't wait to get my hands on the Rockstar .
I can honestly say I held off reading this book because I just didn't want the story to end. S.C. Stephens did not disappoint - this book was just as captivating, emotional and pulse racing as the first two .
All 3 books in one it even better..didn't have to wait - just read right through. It moves fast, but doesnt lack the emotional ups and downs and connection to the characters .
Love  it...emotional- bordered on heart wrenching - laugh out loud kind of book!!! Can't wait for the next one .
I purchased the light grey hobo/handbag, however, it is not near the color I expected. More bronzie, however with that said, I do love the size and convience of it as I am trying to get away from such a large handbag, but yet one that will hold what I carry and this bag does just that, I will keep it and enjoy it, besides the color is growing on me even though it's not grey. tac .
I got the product on time n very happy with its quality. Very pigmented can't wait to see all its potential and all different looks I can do with this. thumbs up and great product to get .
Just got my palette. The product looks great and can't wait to see what I amazing looks I can achieve with this palette .
this is a beautiful shoe but unfortunately too small.  more like a size 9.5 than a 10 US.  the vendor did not place a receipt in the box so not sure how to return it .
I loved it alot. I can't wait to read the next one. I couldn't put my kindle down when reading, i was so drowned in the story that i barelyslept because i was so attached and needed to know what was gonna happen next .
It wasn't exactly purple as described. It was more of a plum color. I would have preferred purple but it served its purpose well .
I love the descriptions of the destinations.  Can't wait to have a few road trips this year.  Some are practically in my back yard .
My husband loves the large capacity and easy-open wide top.  No worries about a zipper tearing. The leather is luscious .
I love this stuff!  Light and easy to apply.  And they no longer sell it in my local supermarket or drug store .
Great for displaying. The stand and pieces give an incredible amount of different ways to display it. Fun to put together and and no decals to worry about .
A short album, but all great stuff. The music really never fails to capture the feel of it's title. The first and fourth tracks are particularly quite complex and full of energy .
I bought this thinking it would be a nice thing to use with my kindle.....Its not all that great...It bends when you try and stand the kindle......its ok for protection but not its purpose........so if you need one buy a better one .
this game did not work well with the kindle........slow ....I tried playing it and the cards would not move ..it was like the were frozen .
better condition than I expected. good quality and included the CD, save me lots of money so I can't complain .
It's a lighter purple than whats in the picture and it doesn't say game boy, but other than that, it's somewhat what I expected .
It's not the pretty blue in the picture and it's a tight fit. I guess I got what I paid for .
Works well. Very durable. Plastic doesn't cover the screen, but it comes with a plastic cover that goes directly on the screen .
Works well. Very durable. Plastic doesn't cover the screen, but it comes with a plastic cover that goes directly on the screen .
We ordered this and got it really fast, but it was in pieces when it arrived.  Probably got damaged during shipping.  We contacted the seller, who was really great.  They immediately shipped a new one.  New one arrived really fast and not damaged.  A few days after we got it, it was broken.  It seems like a cheap product that isn't very durable .
Works great.  Didn't know if it would work since it looks different than the original that came with the keyboard, but it works great .
Case is pretty.  Dropped it several times.  One time the bow feel off.  Just glued it back on.  Nothing else has broken or fallen off .
They're great.  Working fine.  Kids have been using since xmas & haven't had any problems.  Don't expect to have any .
Love this case.  Very durable.  I have dropped my phone several times with this case on it.  Hasn't cracked or broken yet .
Modem not working. Return policy is not good. Dealer is not bearing the return shipment charge. The product is advertised as new but its a refurbished item .
I have a pair of bike shorts that are too snug around the thigh even though they are a Lg,( I am a  size 14) I ordered these in a large because of the reviews stating they were generous and they fit just great!  I wear them under my regular yoga capries or shorts and I love the flexibility of using clothing I am comfortable in.  The padding works for my 10 mi or less trips, don't know if there is enough for the longer rides yet .
17 lbs gone & counting.  Not a problem to stay on with great results. This product is satisfying and practical, I'm never hungry .
I loved this book. It kept my interest and had me wanting more. Can't wait to start the second book .
Great quality charm. Heavyish which is good because it doesn't seem breakable. I thought this would come with two charms and not just one for 4 bucks but I guess thats my bad. No problems with shipping .
These plugs are definetly lighter than the pic but none the less extremely beautiful! They might run a bit small but great quality and super fast shipping .
These tapers were perfect size and not cheap looking at all. Very fashionable and I would definetly buy from this seller again. Too bad I got too small of a mm. I got 12 mm when I should have gotten 14 mm .
Amazing! No hassel with any wired or worrying if the charger was plugged in the right way. I can just place my phone on the dock and know that it will work. Totally loving it .
yeah that's my personal review some stuff  are good sign stuff  are bad you see there radii gave  that's it I don't know what to tell you more .
It was not as depicted in picture. Picture showed an aluminum or similar type finish.  Came in 100t% plastic. My husband put it on anyway and it looks fine. Time will Tell. I would not have purchased if I had known it was plastic. I guess that's what marketing does, show you a superior product and sell you an inferior product in the hopes you won't send it back .
I was trying to find a good book for my book report but all I could find we're books with good story lines, but had curse words being said. When I read this book I was immediately intrigued by the story. It had romance and adventure, and there were no curse words being said. Long story short I am a very happy individual .
I listed that I have a 5c and it did not fit my phone, only fits 5. Had to return cover for refund .
Headphones are transparent and the cables are longer. The back up ear buds set is very useful. The wire is flexible and sporty .
This is the only protective case that has withstand my heavy use...not a scratch...others lost the matt paint and wear terribly on each corner and on the back .Thumbs up .
I always heard a lot about this show but never watched it for myself. So happy that I did I love love love this show... Its like no show or movie I've ever seen! And I think Dexter is as cute as a button .
I've got the new update for my android phone with the daily free spins but not for the kindle... Hmmm .
OUR CHURCH Was studying this book so I bought it. The book is not adiet plan but a life plan .
i bought this book several years ago for a friend and wanted one for myself.  The Bubba Gump restraintsno longer have the book .
This was a birthday gift for my son.  He said it did not have a memory card in the camera.  Perhaps this was my error in not realizing this when I ordered the camera since  I have purchased other cameras and the card was included.  Otherwise this was a good choice for him.  Thank you.  Linda Lucas .
Although it is advertised with Raffle Tickets, this is meant more for folded 1/2 pieces of paper. As soon as you turn the thing, tickets fall out of the entry slot. :( Hope you weren't hoping to win... your ticket fell out a while ago .
Fun game . Works well. Well made . It does not go around  or get knocked down. It lights when you hit it .
Book arrived exactly as described. Good quality, and it even has the dust jacket (most that I have received don't come with those .
Its a pretty good read it helped me in a couple ways.  I don't think it will save my marriage but its helped me move on with peace in my heart, for that i am thankful .
Followed directions exactly and it does not work. It scores the bottle, but the bottle will not separate when the next steps are applied .
All specs said this unit was compatible with my computer, it's not, there are no ports that fit this unit. It may work well when it's installed, but the seller is over-reaching on what computers it works on .
Great game!the pace is incredible! The food get burnt easily though! Pout! I'm glad the money doesn't disappear like some game I know .
I am a big fan of Steven King. Read almost all of his books. I read the shining and saw the movie.I enjoyed the book. I realize now that when Mr. King was younger he suffered from alcoholism, and this addiction gave him the ability to write some seriously out there novels. He is sober now, and so is the craziness.The book gave closure to Danny Torrence, but alcoholism and it's negative affects was part of the theme. The book was not as out there because the craziness of alcoholism is now in check.I wish Mr. King continued sobriety, and thank him for the numerous books I devoured through the years. I am sure it was not easy .
So comfortable.I want to buy at least two more before they stop making them.No need to break them in .
I LOVE IT SO MUCH! It makes my phone look a million times better! I definatly recommend this product! It let's me slide my phone out and in and when i dropped my phone by accident, none of the rhinestones came off and my phone had no damage to it! THANKS .
This works great for the purpose I purchased it for, sanding, nothing can take it's place because there is not a substitute for sand paper so how else can you give it less than a five star rating .
I would really give this 4 1/2 stars. They were shipped fast and a lot cheaper than others I saw online. The only negative thing I could say is that they were just a little thinner than I had hoped. I have mailed several things so far, and have had no problems, but I worry about something poking and ripping them open. I may just be out of line for worrying about that, because I have really had no problems .
Love this scale. The only problem I have is I wish the top were just a little larger. When you weigh a large item, it's hard to see the weight and hard to find the button to hold the weight while you take the package off. But if it was bigger, it wouldn't be so portable!! So, it works well and I'm happy. Needs 4 1/2 stars .
Great case. Holds my phone, ID and debit card.... plus!! No more billfold! Love it !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! So glad I bought it .
Check out my video on YouTube : channel (04mach1speed) and look for this light, it's such an incredible light, and iv been a flashlight enthusiast for over 10 years, and seen technology advance more and more over time, and this is one of the highest output single cell 3.7V lights you can buy other than the Zebralight SC600 mkII 1000.You won't regret buying this lights .
Satisfied in its aspects , but its memory is not that much good...browsing with pointer is diffcalt and slow,that is not ok .
covers everything. good book to have if you own a neon. i have done a full tune up and other minor fixes according to this and everything is great .
looks sick! at first i thought it woudnt be that great but you can't even tell that its plastic. rebel .
its very thin and light weight. but the colors are vibrant. perfect for indoor hanging. if you buy it hoping to put it on your truck or fly it on a staff outside then you'll most likely rate it much different. it is clearly not meant for that. but a great product for the price .
it just doesn't fit every badge, if you have patience and a sharp knife to customize it, it works just fine. does the job. i bought it for part of  Halloween costume .
i just got this light today in the mail. its very bright which i thought it wasn't going to be so thats a plus. it seems heavy duty, i bought am extention cord ahead of time and im glad i did cause the cord it coiled very tight and probably wont reach very far. other than that only time will tell. ill give an update soon once i have been on a few jobs with it and once it rains heavy on it and everything. the only reason i put 4 stars is because when its plugged in and you turn your car on it automatically turns on to the first of 7 unique patterns so you have to push the button 7 times to turn it off. other than that its a great buy so far. i know it will light up the area at night because of how bright it is in the day time. bye for now .
I would have given this 0 stars but it wouldn't let me.  This was not as advertised and it was certainly not new .
The reflective tape was exactly what I was looking to make minor alterations to the shimmer of my lures, excellent .
This is a beautiful case that lives up to its description. It arrived on time and undamaged. The only thing I would caution future customers about is its finish. It's color is listed as &#34;gold,&#34; so there's no misleading advertising, but it is REALLY gold and very shiny. It's a beautiful case though and reminds me of a pocketbook for an evening gown...not a bad idea actually .
No issues from me for this lens. I use it at work.  It has been great, giving excellent photos. Very pleased and would recommend it to others .
They didn't exactly fit as a 'legging', like I was hoping. They are larger in the butt and ankle area than I would have liked, but I still wear them weekly .
Everytime i plug it in it kills signal to my phone! Worthless worthless worthless worthless worthless pos is all it is don't buy .
This is a great collection of photographs and information about a local railroad that no longer exists.  Well written and includes more photos of the F&C than might be expected .
I have years of experience with Dell PC's and would highly recommend this one. I purchased two as gifts, one for my grandson (college bound),and the other for a neighbor family(w/ two high schoolers). I started them off with a 30 minute 101 instruction. They quickly learned the ease of this PC and could now teach me (70 yrs old) . &#34; Your never too old to learn ! &#34; I know they will have years of service and satisfaction and it was my pleasure giving them the Dell Inspiron 15 Touchscreen Laptop.D-dependable  E-excellence  L- lasting  L- lovable  DELL .
After reading the first book, Finding Emma, free on Amazon Prime, I knew I had to purchase Emma's Secret.  There was no way I could wait to read more about this family, when I could again borrow it from Amazon Prime. After being married for twenty-five years, it reminded me of the importance of trust and to not take your spouse or family for granted. It emphasized the importance of all types of relationships, which in this day and time is so important because the definition of family does not always fit in the traditional framework.  Great, clean book, that leaves you reflecting on your own life and values .
i ordered it on March 21, and i received it in the mail in three days.. so thats sooner than the expected shipment date. This BB Cream is light weight, i suggest to shake the product first before using. Coverage is BUILDABLE and flawless!!! no joke.. lol i pumped out one tiny drop and started dotting around the center area of my face and blended it all over.. My face didn't have uneven yellow undertones, and my eye bags disappeared. My pores on my nose were gone too! for once, i didnt have to work hard on my foundation routine. it feels like you're just putting on moisturizer. It may look darker than your skin tone, but after you dot it and blend it out all over your face, it will oxidize and blend with your natural skin tone.. BUT also enhance it more .
I was so excited to recieve samsung smartphone. The best thing I like is large screen and can be used like tablet or call it as phabelet. My excitement was no longer. When box was opened and found screen was borken....which is was like unbelievable thing. When contacted dealer...hardly getting good response. Asking to ship back but cost of shipping is my out of pocket. On asking why, dealer has excuse that system do not allow to print return label.I am not returning out of my conveniance, then why I pay for return shipping. Not sure will I get refund. Overall dealer do not have customer focus .
Not the most comfortable boot, but for the price they are fantastic!!! Love the black/grey color and style.... Great purchase .
This is not the updated edition of MLA, so the book is only good for the essentials of grammar.I would reccomend the 7th edition of this book .
I used this to Preserve my first and favorite scorpion after she passed.I worked perfectly and did not cook the inside of her like i thought it might.Great for bugs .
My speaker works great.I take it to work when we close so that the  entire store has loud music. Speedy delivery. Bass is decent. My battery can easily last 5 days on and playing. Bluetooth range is fairly nice, but maybe a little less than what it says it should be. It doesn't bother me. I'd buy this speaker over the smaller version that I bought before I got my new one anyday .
did not know that the used third party people like the airlines got bogged down in red tape and they used my roomates credit card without authoraztion and have not recevied my money back for cancalation yet .
This bag DOES not look nothing like it did in the picture, it's 10x bigger and the zipper is terrible. I'm sending it back first chance i get...DON&#34;T BUY IT .
My son loves this court an the bounce back is great cause he doesn't have to run everywhere for his ball...my husband an I even plays on it it's great all around we all l ove it .
it was . ok but ok think that those  people that are onthis book should get paid tons of money because if not then mest up they wasted they time for nothing. GOOD BOOK THOO .
The advanced Technology International .303 Enfield MK1, 2 and 5 #4 Scope Mount was welled made but wouldn't fir my modified gun.  The vendor was kind enough to let me return product .
Case was not what i expected. It looks nice online but is not is so difficult to put on the phone & it took forever to arrive .
Haven't tried all of the flavors but the pineapple is amazing. Honestly, I keep them on my dresser because I can smell it and it through the box. Yum. (could be bad if you have dogs that like to eat it_) but I like it .
Okay, so I put these on my Honda Ruckus about a week ago. First day I rode with them on when I was walking the bike I would hit my calves on the pegs. Needless to say, my calves were pretty bruised but I "heard" that they really help just in case you drop the ruckus, so I kept them on a few more days to see if I can deal with them. THANK GOD. Went around a turn (I wasn't going fast) and slid because the white line was still a bit wet and I hit it wrong, my peg hit the curb throwing me off balance, I jumped/jolted into the grass. It skid around in a circle, I jumped up (not hurt) ran over to the bike... not a SCRATCH except on the bottom side of the peg. My legs can take a beating for a few more days until I get used to them, NOT taking them off, EXTREMELY glad I got them. Oh, and I learned my lesson not to take tight turns on a dewey morning :\ Plus, these pegs help a lot when I'm going over rail road tracks that's for sure. The only reason for the 4 stars not 5 is because of my legs. You don't want to see a picture .
If you want to practice form buy it. Just do it. do it do it do it. :) You won't regret it .
I got this for my boyfriend and he loves it. He drives it all around the house. I'm not the best at drifting it but when I do it's really fun! It's smaller than I thought, but I prefer that .
So I am a size 5.5 but all I saw were the womens 9-11. Bought them anyways because I don't care if they're too big. These socks are REALLY comfortable. Usually below the knee socks cut into my skin under my knee and these didn't. They're really soft and the material is nice. Would definitely buy more but I now have like 15 pairs of high socks haha.... Two thumbs up for these .
This product was cheaply made, the strings would not stay tight. We sent it back.The good thing was, it was not hard to return .
The case did not have the magnets to keep it closed. However, Amazon came through right away by crediting my account and sending me a shipping label. I ordered another cover and it's great. I hated the first one, but love the replacement. I really do recommend this product .
I read this in two sittings! I am deeply grateful for the wealth of information these guys share in this book! Have I put everything into practice yet? No, I just finished it two minutes ago! I can't wait for the sequel...&#34;Look what happened when I put Prosperous Coach into Practice!&#34; This is going to be good .
It came to me missing parts and  we I can't even usr it ? I'm not happy with it don't get it .
have always liked this two-tone polish for summer, and while I do not use a gel, glad to see it comes in gel as well as regular polish  I had nit sen it for a long time and am glad  now know where to locate it and its sister two-tone colors .
ordered 2 got 2 different tablets different operating systems. one was full of some ones personal photos and videos. could not find contact info for seller .
great present for the person who likes the big bang theroy tv show and who has a cat that looks just like that. which by the way was a rescue from a shelter who came named &#34; penny&#34;. But have to say there was no sole on the bottoms and it was coming apart at one  of the seams. We managed to fix it .
I love these boxes.  They are so well made and the prices are wonderful.  I decorate them with fabrics of different football teams and fill them with Smarties candies and sell them to raise money for the American Cancer Society. I also have found some Duct tape about the width around the box (like the West Virginia Mountianeers) and on the top I have found ribbon with West Virginia on it, so I decoupage it on the top of the box, and paint the rest of the box blue and gold.I have also decorated some with cancer fabric, Steelers, Cowboys, Marshall U of WV, anything anyone wants that I can find the fabric for.  I sell these boxes loaded with SMARTIES rather  than cigarettes.  I SUGGEST TO MY CUSTOMER :BE A SMARTIE  -----  DON'T SMOKE .
The value you get with the digital package is second to none and the prices were amazing. Great product and service .
The purchase arrived well received. The one thing that I was concerned about was when I completed purchase; I did not see the total amount I was paying until it arrived in my email. I am grateful that shipping cost was not excessive. This is much appreciated. This purchase was made due to not being able to afford new phone at this time, and the phone gets pretty good reception-hard to come by in some areas. The darn phone still isn't working well! It maybe a bad connection in the phone itself. Need to save for upgrade anyway.Thank you again-good communication and purchase .
My dermatologist recommended this. My issue is (was) female pattern baldness in the crown  of my head. I use this about once or twice a week and it has thickened the the hair which gives the appearance of fuller coverage. My first application is when I first wash my hair and then mid-week (I have relaxed hair which i would have NEVER contemplated before b/c my hair was so thin in the crown). I have been using it 6 months and my dermatologist is also testing it in an independent blind study for efficacy. Both the Dr and myself are very pleased with the results achieved. I have been using it in tandem with Flutamide (which supresses testosterone production) to inhibit further hair loss .
Came exactly as described. Snug fit on the sides, not so much on the top and bottom. Attractive case, feels nice .
Matte finish is great - perfect fit. Application Tip - apply from side to side, not from top to bottom .
Ribbon cord was messed up and screen didn't work properly.  Wouldn't recommend for a replacement screen.  It was a waist of money .
Kuroshitsuji is probably my favorite anime so when I saw this item on Amazon for under 15 bucks including shipping price I was very intrigued. I was cautious though to read reviews though so that I wouldn't waste money on these figures if they were poor quality. But after seeing so many marvelous opinions I decided to order them. They came even earlier than expected, each wrapped individually in a plastic bag with stand for each figure, and all of the figures came in a bubble bag. They are so adorable, I could not stop smiling for hours. It made me even more happy to see some of the detail they put into the figure, including Ciel's different colored eyes, the chain on Sebastian's pocket watch, and even the end of Lau's sash. The only problem I had with this product is that Sebastian's glove was more skin-colored rather than white, but that is an easy fix. I highly recommend this to any other Kuroshitsuji/Black Butler fan .
This camera was not what I expected I did not like it at first it was good but the picture quality wasn't what I wanted .
Best ever, since im a TRK driver, been using it for a few yrs, never no feed back just right .
Very interesting.  I  have used some of these for years, and they do work.  Good to know we don't always have to rely on store bought products .
I love to wear my keds. The price, the quality and having them available was why I chose them,Its had to find keds this time of year. I really want a pair of leather keds with the same style and size, just leather not canvas material. Thanks again and hope I will hear from you soon when these can be found .
this battery, did not fit my phone when fit to the phone it was raised to high and the back cover would not close .
I didn't receive a case it was a rope bracelet. I'm very upset because I was really excited to get that case and was highly upset and confused why I paid for it and didn't receive the correct order .
I am very careful with my iPad mini. I'm disappointed because after a few weeks of use the case started falling apart! I do not recommend this. Spend the extra money and get the one from the apple store .
Received the product to discover it was not functional, it did not power on at all from out of box .
I DISLIKE THIS PRODUCT BECAUSE I DID NOT RECIEVE MY PINK HEART STERREO HEADPHONES ALONG WITH MY ORDER AND I WOULD LIKE TO RECIEVE WHAT I HAVE PAID FOR .
I bought this toy for my 9 mo. old boxer. She destroys everything and digs up the yard.  She loves this ball when I take her to the beach at night for her walk because she can see it even in the dark. I don't fill it with treats. That way she doesn't continuously chew on it, she just brings it to me after chewing a couple of times. I wear a thin rubber glove so I can throw it for her without the slobber :)  I also purchased The JollyPet Plastic Egg. It is entertaining to watch her play with it. Both are amazing products that I would recomend for large destructive dogs .
My 9 mo. old boxer, DeeDee, destroys every toy she's ever had. I purchased the Jolly Pet Egg after watching videos of large dogs playing with one. She loves it !!!  It is so entertaining to watch her with it . Thank you for such a wonderful toy. The only bad thing I can say is when she gets it agaist the house at 3 a.m. it is a little noisy. I also purchased the Planet Dog Orbee-Tuff Dog Toy (Luna, it glows in the dark). She has not destroyed it either :)  Both toys are great .
Excellent story, but the acting was not up to standard.  For example, Alec Baldwin did sound, look or a Southerner.Whoopi always looks like she's acting .
looked like a good thing on the computer but did not meet our exspections. Did not do as promiced. would not recomend .
i had been looking all over the place for these and they work amazing. the lids stay on tight and if you drop them you don't have to freak out about them opening because they wont. great product .
i hated this. its made so cheaply that the lil pieces that hold the case together broke the first time i went to take it part to even put it on my phone and if you have an off brand iphone charger it won't fit in the slot to charge your phone. along with having no use of the every edges .
this isn't at all what i expected. i doesn't stay on my phone worth s*** and the printing is horrible and looks sloppy, my new year old niece could of drew a better picture .
I gave it one star because i was so excited that my phone was finally going to get fixed, when it arrived i took it straight to a proffesional he installed it in minutes and when it was turned on only parts of the screen worked! I was very disappointed that this product didn't turn iut the way i thought i would .
Hhuuggee disappointment! Waited for this product over a month it finally comes in i get it replaced by a professional obviously paid quite an amount of money for him to fix it and it didn't work at all the while screen was frozen!!! It sucks nobody buy this .
Never used very much and the rocker arm on the intake valve split at it's installation pin location. It was running then bogged..then I could never get it to start after that....thought it was gas...plug...etc...finally decided to tear into it and found trouble. I'll never buy another small engine OHV Subaru engine again...finding parts is a joke too. Decide just to weld it...was not easy...but I'll run it til it dies again .
I ordered two pair of John Deere Boots for my twin boys for their birthday presents. The boots were exactly the way they were pictured. The sizes that I ordered were true to their sizes and both boys loved the boots. The boots were of excellent quality and they have been wearing them pretty much every day. The boots met my qualifications and I would not hesitate to order from Elite Hero again. For my experience, I give Elite Hero a 5 star rating on their product and excellent customer service. Thanks so much .
As a firm grows fast and large, internal trust level nosedives.That is my situation I found from this book.Good book not thrilling though .
This machine works well , powerful and not any harder to use than any other unit I have used before. I found that the extension is identical to a piece I already had from another gas powered unit I already had. I can switch shafts with different heads easily .
an excellent book...So enjoyed the book..I do not as a rule..read historical novels..But Callie put a new perspective on  her book, that you don't  usually find...It was funny..It was loving and of course the ending was perfect...I will certainly read more of Callie's books .
I am extremely disappointed with this watch. I have only worn it four times and the band is wearing out. The leather has begun to peel off and it looks terrible. I will never order another one online .
Just delightful...I enjoyed the fast pace.  Light reading, could lay down and then pick up with no trouble.  Thank you .
I loved this book sooooo much. I wish it could never end. I am so happy Priscilla Cummings wrote a sequel .
I loved this book the way that August was happy at the end he didn't care what he looked like. I think this book is good life reference on that it doesn't matter what you are on the outside it only matters what's on the inside .
This game is so good that I I'm really good at drawing thank you for this app when I played it is not boring and it was a very good game .
ALL I did on the game was feed the kid candy that's all  worst game ever don't get it don't .
i oder fan and moter and small repaif part for a 1996 lancer slide on truck camper all good not chep but goood .
Not only is this not a rubberized case, they won't write me back and tell me how to get my money back because this case is hard plastic and not at all what I wanted. Sorry service, attitude filled person who first corresponded with me. Now they won't honor the return. I haven't heard a thing from them for 9 days. Be aware, this is NOT a RUBBERIZED case. It IS HARD PLASTIC. I was told it has a rubber feel when I said I wanted to return it. HA! How does hard plastic feel anything like rubber? Do not buy unless you want a hard, snap on case .
This app is amazing it so fun I play it all the time with my friends and family I am not able to stop playing it .
I only wore this watch 3 TIMES and then it broke. It is cheap and weak and I am very upset that I paid my money for this and it broke this fast. This item is not worth buying even for just 6 dollars. I am not satisfied .
This is a nice case. I  like to use it when I'm going out to places where I don't want to carry a  lot so it's  great for carrying little but important things .
This is a pretty case. Although I didn't get everything that was in the picture I still like the case and it's nice. The downfall to this case is the lace. It gets dirty very fast and that can take away from the appearance a lot. Also the pearls are nice and none have fallen on yet but I like they packed for extra. So this is a very nice case .
This is my NUMBER ONE favorite case. This is my first 3D case and I just love it. The day I got it I couldn't wait to put it on my phone. I get a lot of compliments on it and it makes me so happy to see such a beautiful case compliment my phone such as this .
I put it into the tire and inflated it, but before I could even install the wheel on the bike the tube popped inside the tire. There was green ooze everywhere. I don't recommend this, get something better .
no heaters. useless. the whole point of buying these 'mres' is so I don't have to carry a stove in my pack. the description says nothing about these meals not containing heaters .
Awesome movie and great with friends! I absolutely loved it. And u guys have to stop comparing it with Borat. That's a whole different movie. You can't compare a movie and give the the one u liked more a better review. These reviews is intended for someone's review on a movie, not two different movies .
5 star product but it runs a bit tight. I wear a 34B and have to be very careful getting this thing on (while not wearing a bra) and its pretty darn tight .
I bought the kindle edition, and it must be nothing like the actual book.The book's description promises profession leveling up to 600, material gathering maps and gathering routes. Many of the professions (blacksmithing, tailoring, etc) only go up to 375 or 425. There's barely any maps for gathering professions (herbalism has a list of places to go, but only maps for a select few "valuable" herbs).There's nothing about gaining character titles or epic mounts in the kindle edition.What the book does cover is interesting, and varies considerably from other free profession leveling guides. I appreciate the information it covers, just wish it covered everything the book description SAID it would.The book doesn't have half of what the book description said it would. I would have liked to pay half of what I did .
Game runs smoothly, but tips I make by going back to earlier levels of a hotel don't always become available in the following levels. I can accumulate star points like crazy, bit not the tips that I want to use towards upgrades. Not sure if it's just part of the game, meaat to discourage players from repeating the easiest levels for tips to use in later levels? That's the only thing I haven't loved about this game so far .
If I wanted to pick up trash around the house, I would. I don't need a game for that. You can't customize your character's look, you have to just keep hitting random and hope for one that looks the way you want. Oh, and if you want a character in some race besides white? Forget it. There are none .
Case isn't quite what I'd consider gel but it had the same thickness and comfort when holding it. Protects my phone and absorbs the shock quite well. The polka dot side is a bit too shiny for my liking but all in all well worth the 1.47 I spent on it .
It does not work..I tried it on several different devices to no avail.  Probably a fluke, but there it is .
While I have not purchased or actually read this book myself, I did spend some time flipping through the pages when I found this book at my MIL's house.  Flipping through it was enough to make me realize how bad this book truely was.This book teaches you to seperate your children from their children.  To make sure you are the most important person in your grandchilds life.  To make sure that your children, never trust you again.  To teach your grandchild how to lie.  To do what you want to do, because well, aren't you the most important person in the world?Blech!In reality this book is a surefire way to make sure your grandchildren do not know their grandmother.  Because if you become this grandmother, I don't know what mother in their right mind would ever allow you to see her children again.For a normal sane person, this book could be considered hilarious.  But unfortunately, for some (not unlike my MIL) it is dangerous.  If your mother or MIL already have pushy tendencies (i.e. "I've done this before, never mind that it was 30 years ago, so I must know what I'm doing better than you, move out of my way.)  This will only push her further over the edge.  Buyer Beware .
I originally just installed the free version for a trip we were taking, but pretty much knew right away this was one I'd have to buy the full version for.  He had the four included in the free one figured out right away.  He loves it.  He loves any type of vehicle in general.  And he's really been getting into puzzles lately - so it's a win/win.  And the balloons he can pop at the end of each puzzle are an added bonus.  Now he'll bring the kindle to me and ask play truck puzzles mommy?  No issues with the app running in general.  Colors are great.  And the puzzles get more difficult the further along you go.  The only thing that might be nice is making it easier to go back to the main screen of the app.  It took him a little bit to learn how to do it, so I'd have to do it for him the first few times.  So if he's getting frustrated with a puzzle and can't figure it out, he was stuck in that puzzle until I could come help him .
My 16 month old son is always taking my phone to play on.  I needed something he could play with and I not have to worry about him wrecking it and me being out a lot of money.  This is perfect.  He's dropped it several times, and still no issue.  The back did pop off one time when he dropped it, and it just popped right back on.  It also works for what I need too.  I've used it several times now to do work on.  Obviously there is not much memory so you'll need an extra micro SD, but for the price, I'll take it...I did how ever have an issue with the ear buds that came with it.  There was a nasty dirty finger print on the ear piece.  They weren't the best quality ear buds anyways, but I definitely wasn't using them after that.  I contacted the seller, and they sent me a new set of earbuds in a different brand.  Small issue, but still 100% happy with purchase .
This case not only looks amazing but it is also quite durable feeling and seems to offer great protection for my phone .
piece of junk-whimpy and does not function well...the keys don not come back up when depressed ON THE TRANSMITTER-i THREW IT AWAY .
Material too thin and slippery-poor design does not stay in place. DIFFICULT TO ATTACH TO SEAT AS STRAPS DO NOT WORK WELL .
It smells amazing and works ok! I won't buy this again . I bought two bottles. It sprays out very thick.. do not care for it all  makes a mess and the shine doesn't last long .
I would never ever pay 49 dollars  a bag for salt when I can get it for 3.99 a bag this is insane .
DO NOT BUY THIS! I BOUGHT THIS NEAR CHRISTMAS TIME I OPENED IT AND IT DIDNT WORK PEICE OF JUNK POORLY MADE. I THROW IT IN THE TRASH!!!!!!!!!!!! DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME .
I am so weird about buying things like this but I am 5'8 148 pounds im in great shape . I use this when I do cardio at the gym and It makes you sweat a lot!!! I have noticed a difference in my stomach area. I have been using it for 3 weeks now. I also wear it in the sauna and that REALLY makes you sweat! Plus its good support for your back while working out. It stays put doesn't slide or come undone at all! I would totally recommended this product to anyone! I talked my friend into buying one! She told me she can see a big difference in my abs .
This skirt is amazing quality ! not cheap ! its worth the price! fits amazing ! I am 5'8 148 pounds and I bought a medium not to tight and not to loose .
I bought  a Ruger LC9 for my wife, but she needed help with her aiming, so got  the LaserMax Red Laser.  It fit perfectly and easy to install and adjust.  It is very light and it you really can't feel any added weight .  I'm happy with it .
It is better that I was expected. Little, not heavy, very good to read newspaper, ebooks, pdfs, word documents. I recommended .
When I was a child, this book was everything to me. Real effort when into these diagrams. I remember reading about everything from architecture to cellular processes to Australian rules here. I not have understood all of it, but it still was one of the greatest influences on my academic interests later in life .
Buying this product may have been one of the most invigorating experiences in my life. After I was brigaded by the Seriously Radical Society for not being sufficiently nerdy, I was lost. But now, this 3 piece nerd kit allows me to emulate my hero, St. Nye. Whenever I spam "religion of peace" on my favorite web forum or onanate with [m]y friends, I feel like a real badarse. My dog Colby agrees, this kit brings out the euphoric scientist in all of us .
Despite the recent trend towards least-common denominator shows about "smart people", this one appears actually quite witty. For once, we get a show about "betas" that's witty and entertaining. There are no condescension or petty stereotypes here. The only problem I can see occurring later on is the characters devolving into over-used "nerd" stock characters .
I only gave 4 stars because I still can't mulch my grass. They cut nice and throw grass nice just not a good mulching blade .
this is a heavy guage cast handels and other parts are nice and heavy. Not like the other cheap pressed or plastic parts you get a surprize with some other manufacturers of faucets. This company is great one time my plumber cut the stem to short. I called up premier and they sent me a new one free. I have bought many of thier faucets never had a problem so far .
you can't buy the tools separate for less. Got this set on sale. The drill is the heavy duty hammer model. and the batterys are the 9180's which are the top battery also. Had an old dewalt set just like this that lasted for probably about 10 years. Sold that set for 150. Then bought this one. These Dewalt tools just keep giving and giving. The impact driver is the goto tool for driving screws it rarely snaps or strips screws. Get it while its cheap .
I love the fabric, but it isn't as i expected regarding length, it is not as long as displayed picture .
Got four pages in an was not able to enjoy it. No thanksBlack boa boa boa boa boa back .
The reviews stating to order 1/2 size bigger than normal are true.  Awesome boot for Afghanistan where the terrain is not smooth.  And have held up good so far.  Very comfortable, light weight and breath good .
Been using ESPN for years. So just getting used to the different format. Not bad for the fact of the quick research of players. What I don't like though is the fact that as the game is in play that it doesn't show the players stats. Passes carries Todd none of that until the game is concluded .
Didn't like it once I received it. Will be returning. And I didn't like the way the top fit either .
Again, like all of the OTC products I've owned, this is no exception to their quality at reasonable prices.  You can pay slightly less for a clone set, but for the best quality, it's best to go for the OTC line.  This set includes a very nice blow-molded case and heavy duty tools.  They have nice, smoothed edges/sides along with &#34;beefy&#34; castings/forgings.  So far, I'm way more happy with these pullers versus any of the other cheaper ones I've come across and used before.  A very smart purchase, in my opinion.  So as I always say, a huge thank you to Amazon and OTC for such a nice product at a good price .
This puller appears to be very well built, like most of the OTC products.  Seems I've started quite a collection of OTC products here lately, thanks to the help from Amazon, which is a good thing.  I like the quality of their products and will continue to buy them.  Though I have not yet used this puller, I anticipate it will help me through some tricky situations.  Much more sturdy than those cheap U-shaped pullers, which usually results in the legs spreading (or breaking) and the whole puller popping off (sometimes dangerously).  I feel this puller will prevent this and that's why I purchased it.  Thank you Amazon & OTC .
Again, all of the Alltrade/Powerbuilt products I've owned so far have been excellent.  Love their heavy blow-molded cases and the lifetime warranty, just in case it's ever needed.  On some of these types of removers, people have stated the nut at the end of the long bolt has broken off.. well this one has been heavily welded in place, so I don't think there is a chance of it breaking off, unless you're doing something terribly wrong!  Actually, the small nut was not meant to be turned, but rather held stationary, while the extra long, heavy duty &#34;driving&#34; nut is turned by either a wrench or impact.  Following this procedure will help prevent failure in that respect.  Thanks again for a great product at a very nice price .
Love this socket set!  Love the quality, the blow-molded plastic storage case and the number of sizes available!  This is the perfect set for both the DIY'er and the automotive professional.  Nice, clear markings and lifetime warranty.  I'm very happy with this purchase and highly recommend it to everyone else looking for these types of sockets.  Oh, and yes, it does include the 33mm socket many people have been looking for and ordering separately, due to many kits not including it.  This one does.  Once again a huge thank you to Amazon and its affiliated companies for such a nice product at a good price .
Once again I'm posting rave reviews about the product(s) I got from Amazon.  This Alltrade Ball Joint kit is wonderful.  It seems to be very well made (forged steel instead of cast).  I love the heavy duty plastic case and the fact it even includes the infamous Chrysler/Dodge ball joint sockets to remove those screwed-in joints found on some of their products.  Though I've never used those sockets (and hope I never have to, from what I've read) at least they're included just in case I have to.  Thank you for such a nice product at a good price .
Wow this boxset came in the mail really unexpectedly and boy was I not disappointed when it did.Firstly, the actual box of this box set is amazing and I could've read all of the different little quotes on it for ages, except, there were books inside. The books were hardcover and beautiful and there were signatures from John Green in Looking For Alaska and The Fault In Our Stars just as I'd expected.The actual content of the books are amazing. It is an understatement to say the John Green has written 4 of possibly the best YA books of our time in LFA, TFIOS, An Abundance of Katerines and Paper Towns. The stories are so full of content and meaningful life lessons and hilarious dialogue that it is impossible not to compare these books to the best of the best of YA writing--like JK Rowling or Rick Riordan or Cath Crowley or Melina Marchetta. And just like these amazing authors, his books resonate to the reader and I can guarantee that these books will be loved.The actual content of the stories in the books are so different, though, that it's sometimes to believe that it is the same author's writing. But you can bet that in every book you will cry, you will laugh, and you will absorb .
This book set/series is a perfect 5 out of 5 stars because the story is so enthralling and captures your attention from start to finish. The author, Rick Riordan, is an amazing author who's writing makes it seem as though you aren't even reading a book written by him, you're just reading Percy tell you about his life.The books are full of adventure and just when you think there is going to be a boring part in the book, something else happens, and so on throughout the whole series.There are good guys, bad guys, gods and monsters that personalities and character is so believable, again, it doesn't feel like this is fiction. In this way, the books are quite similar to the Harry Potter series because you get to know the good guys and the bad guys and the story is just as interesting, in my opinion, as the Harry Potter series.The covers of the books are A+, too .
I have had this cam for about a week now. Some times it will go 24 hours with no restarts, then for no reason at all it may restart 3-4 times within an hour. Not happy about that .
I love the Mannheim Steamroller versions of the instrumentals BUT don't so much care for the spoken words.  Still a nice option for patriotic music .
i like the blu 5.3 it is not to big .the dual sim card  the gps is what i like, but no skype and the battery does not last .
You get what you pay for. It barely can hold my nylon acoustic strings let alone a steel setup. Its 5 bucks. So what really can you expect? Its not bad. I say that because it does the job. It can do a few recordings. But the placement of the capo can damage your guitar neck if placed too close. Its pretty cheap. Its literally a metal handle with rubber strips glued to it. Its kinda embarrassing actually. So there's no aesthetic purposes .
What can I say that already hasn't been said? Its a 5 dollar screen, its cheap but gets the job done. The velcro comes undone often but 90% of bugs stay out so hey that's a win right? You can fix that with a little duct tape and your good, only problem was that this particular screen is a bit small for my door frame but not small enough so where it doesn't work. I give this a D .
As I always do I check reviews and multiple websites before buying anything online. The reviews were spot on about this one. Its quiet when you type (which is great when someone is sleeping). The back lights work great and is easy to switch the color on the fly. Press the Fn Key+5 to switch colors and Fn+2 darkens it while Fn+8 brightens it and has a pulse setting. Only thing that bugs people is that its a WIRED keyboard. This doesn't bug me because wireless keyboards don't respond as well or just randomly shut off when playing a game. I highly recommend this keyboard for the feel, and the price tag. Don't let the foreign company intimidate you. Aula is pretty quality .
Great shirt, great fit, great price. Just not as red as shown in the picture listed. Fits great for athletic builds. 5,7 180lbs. If you're taller I may not recommend it. But otherwise its a great looking shirt. Definitely my favorite .
This is awful...The velcro is cheeaaapppp little white strips and come undone and its a pain to place in between blinds and the window. Its not really a screen but is more a white netting. I give this F- Stay away from this particular brand .
Mr. Cagle's interpretation of the middle passage has brought me back to the legendary Alex Haley epic Roots the story never changes.  Our ancestor's plight was extremely difficult and unbearable.  Some of us committed suicide, to never live another day of torture.  If it wasn't for the few hero's and shero's like Nat Turner who was bless with Gods guidance to begin awakening us from bondage, the revolution begins....  Thank God for people like Kenya to re-educate us about the struggle.Our American History class was not as detailed with the truths like Cagle's writing.  Matter of fact our classroom were purposely vague.Reading his work is mind jolting; sometimes the comfort ability of freedom leads us to become mentally lackadaisical.  The message has to be repeated over and over through time so we will never forget. This screenplay will scream to all nations of our ancestor austerities bringing forth that freedom is not free .
These lights give off WAY less light than what they seemed to advertise. I intended to stick them above our cabinets (underneath) for more light and it doesn't even make a difference :( I would not recommend these unless you use them right next to your bed to see your phone...they are dim .
The pen is made in china, so I wonder if this is a duplicate and not the original aquadoodle. The pen leaks too much water, and the drawing just keeps expanding since water spreads outwards from the line. So if I try to draw a circle, it becomes one big filled circle instead. So we can't draw any fine drawings on it with this doodle pen. I've to find an alternative to this hopeless pen .
I normally don't buy clothes online because I worry about fit. However, this fit perfectly! They are so comfy and soft! After one night in them I wanted to buy another set .
I did not receive what I expected in this product. First of all, I expected more selections than just asimple toggle switch that allows only two settings--High & Low. Allso, the volume is minimal, to saythe least. However, I'm impressed with the quality of the housing of the motor and its power.Why did I not receive an invoice and a return UPS label .
Great adaptor for the price! Much cheaper than the Apple one and works great. Have bought several of these and haven't had any problems .
The back was a good price and fit for my broken phone. Don't really need any of the tools accept the screw driver .
I am disappointed in this coffee maker...It is  difficult to fill with water. The coffee is not easily poured, but rather "drips" out of the carafe. You have to remove the lid to get it to pour . .. and while the carafe is thermal, the coffee DOES NOT stay hot for hours... it is lukewarm in about 30 min .
not like the picture at all !! doesn't go all the way around the phone as shown on the picture .
The review says it's good, but I just found it is in totally unbelievable bad quality when I got it. I will never buy a stuff just by its good review records .
This is a waste of money. Do not buy this product, you might as well be taking children's vitamins. Save your money .
I love this book. I had it as a kid and me and my brothers and sisters would all sit around it looking for all the different objects. The artwork is amazing and some of the items are difficult to find so you don't just breeze through it. Each quest has several different things you have to find...for instance, the very first quest you have to search for the three other adventurers, find weapons to arm yourself with, look for the book of maps, and gather food to take along with you. You also need to find a red key on each page so that you can defeat the wizard later on. Then, at the bottom of the page there are bonus items to find, so you're usually looking for at least 50 objects. It's a lot of fun, and my siblings and I still enjoy this book all these years later. Even my mom was looking at it with us, so it's good for all ages .
I had bought it in hopes that it might be something like Dragon Quest (also by Usborne), where you have to find a hundred things on each page and it's like a super awesome &#34;Where's Waldo&#34; sort of deal. But that's not the case. You only have to find a couple of things for each quest (a piece of armor, a goblet, and one or two things that need to be found to free the knight from enchantment) and solve an easy riddle. It was interesting, but I don't think it was worth the money at all .
It is so much easier to tattoo with one of these!! Before this I was just switching the clip cord between my machines and had to adjust the setting each time so I wish I'd invested in it sooner (my tattoo partner didn't want me to buy the &#34;cheap&#34; one and wanted to save for the more expensive dual power supply). This is so much better and easier to use and it's pretty good quality. I don't expect it to last more than a few months before it burns out on me, but for the low price I'll just buy another for back-up before it even gets to that point .
I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I haven't had to use it enough to know if the material will last long or if the straps will start to rip. But it all fits quite nicely in there. The cases are pretty awesome. I snapped a couple of the dividers in half so I could fit things better. There's pretty much a snug compartment for everything except the power supply so I just wrap that up in a towel and put it in the larger compartment with the cases. Even if the material doesn't last very long and starts to wear out after a while I'll definitely buy another bag because it all just fits so perfect .
It was less expensive than buying at the store. Never had to leave the comfort of my home. I would recommend on line buying from this company .
Because I have &#34;bigger&#34; feet I am self conscious about shoes that are too big or that make my feet look big. I can wear flip flops in a size 9 but ordered these in a 9 1/2 because they are flip flop/shoes and in shoes I am a 9 1/2. I have about a half an inch of shoe beyond my toes. Since the shoes are &#34;bulky&#34; already, I am not a fan of any &#34;extra&#34; bigness!  They are cute though and look great under jeans. With these shoes I can match any shirt with jeans .
I really have not tried the Peanut butter as yet.  But will do.  Gave one to my Pastor's wife who is a peanut butter expert .
Doesn't work. Came with parts missing and loose screws. Couldn't find my receipt to return it. Do not buy this .
I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to keep their phone looking new. No fingerprints, no second try to hope you can get a perfect fit, and no air bubbles. Amazing product at a great price. Imitations are just a waste of money .
it's so useful,actually you can plug it on your mobile devise and also you can read it on your computer with using the SD adapter.add to that no freeze could be happen when move the files.but there is only one thing.the free space is round 15 GB only not 16 as they mentioned out side the package.but about me this doesn't matter. just go for it if you need more space on your device .
if looking for nice band and something looking different  just go for it, but you can not wear it in the summer , because it's too hot over your skin,and this my mind .
I'm so upset about this product, actually I like the design but when I ask for someone I received big size. not the same size which should be.I lost my money for nothing .
This is awesome, my husband got it for me for christmas and i absolutely love it. Definitely a good price for it and I wasn't disappointed .
PRODUCTO SOLICITADO CON VARIOS ARTICULOS MAS EN LA MISMA ORDEN, TODOS ERAN PARA ENTREGAR A LA MIMSA DIRECCION, SOLO QUE ESTE AUN NO LLEGA .
I received the boots today I totally love them haven't worn them yet I tried them on they are true to size I'm a size 5 which is hard to find something that I actually like but overall can't wait to wear them they look comfortable I might order another pair in different color ; overall satisfied shipping was fast too &#128076;&#128076;&#128175;&#128513;&#128513;&#128513 .
Not much I can really say  -- Classic Poirot, classic Christie.  Re-reading this novel was like comfortably sitting by a winter's fire in your favorite slippers, with a hot cup of chocolate, and perusing a favored scrapbook .
Very fast shipping. Got my costume witchin 2 weeks prior to order date. I was a little disappointed in the costume itself, not the service. It looked like a large size instead of a small, even though it was labelled small. That is not services fault .
great read cover to cover nonstop action  and suspense got to,read,the whole series just couldn't put it down a.d it could be so true .
I have owned many, many webkinz in my day, but in my opinion  this one is the cutest, I mean come on look at those cute big eyes. When I had my chihuahua on webkinz I named him Charlie. But enough about me and now to the product. These stuffed animals in my past experience are extremely durable and lovable. These stuffed animals just refused to get destroyed. They are also insanely soft, and fun to pet. (Don't Judge!!) But this amazing little stuffed animal is so much more than just your average stuffed animal. Around it's front paw you will find a code tag that will allow you to turn this into a virtual pet. You redeem your webkinz on [...]. Once you've redeemed the code you can adopt the pet and print off it's birth certificate which is unique and cool. Now that your pet has been adopted you can decorate the room just the way you want, and when you run out of money (Kinzcash) you can hit the arcade were you can play a ton of insanely fun games. Webkinz are not high maintenance like some other virtual pets. These Webkinz rock!!!!!(look out for cheap imitators) Overall this product is a no brainer buy, especially at this price .
Don't listen to all those negative reviews, they are just haters who packages came damaged, mine came unscathed and it is an amazing frame. It is relatively cheap, and looks WAY more expensive than it really is. Overall I would really recommend this frame .
Yes this is the best behind the door clip on basketball hoop that I have ever used. However, when I got it the net had a few grease stains on it, and the net is no where near a tight knit as the advertise, balls slip through it all the time (some even get stuck). Now here's the bummer, it doesn't come with the XL ball as pictured, it comes with the normal size ball. I'm gonna contact the company to see what is up with that. Great product, terrible seller .
This Product is a piece of crud DO NOT BUY IT!!!!! It broke the first time I put my plane on its top on the bench to readjust the tail section. It should not do that. Find a better listing the foam is so much weaker than that of the original tail section, and also is a brighter color (which I didn't care about, but just letting you know .
I have had this truck for about a year, and it has been in the shop or had a problem 3 or 4 times. Now, I am not too rough of the truck, I just drive it up and down the street and pull a few drifts, but the first time I used it, it didn't go very fast, then the ESC (Electric Speed Control) started to smoke out of nowhere, it wasn't even wet. So they sent me a new one and I installed it, but then the axle flew of after going over a bump and I had to send it one again. If that wasn't enough the gears inside the gearbox have become loosened and no longer can turn the wheels all I hear is an annoying motor. Finally the tires are starting to become undone from the rims which are causing a lot of problems while driving. This can is not as great as the claim it to be, I'd get something better. However, I might have gotten a lemon because everyone else raves about the durability .
This hat, although its pretty comfy it just not as warm as I had hoped. It may keep you warm when it's 40 or 50 degrees out but as soon as you hit below 32 degrees it becomes nothing but a fashion statement that requires another warmer hat underneath .
For what it is it is, a toy, it is very nice. The pictures don't show it but it has a nice metallic pink finish. The overall quality is very good, although the packaging it arrived in could use some work - just wrapped in some bubble wrap loosely and thrown in a large box could definitely see it getting damaged during shipping - lucky for me it didn't .
I LOVE the color orange and it can be tricky to find products I like in this color. It does have an odor like others have commented on, however I believe over time it will go away. I find the rotation the best feature. The ONLY thing I would change is the hole in the back. It is left open so dirt can get in to scratch the iPad. I covered it with clear plastic and tape since you can't see the eye soar it creates inside .
this game is so addicting!!!!!! because it just keeps challenging you and you can't stop!!! I hope you like it as much as I do .
THE NARRATOR SUCKS BIG TIME! Can't say the words RIGHT & Well..... NARRATOR SUCKS ON TEXT-To-SPEAK!!!!  Why could you not make this book & the last one a audible .
This Calender keeps me so organized. Between work, appointments, paying bills, and my 17 year old daughter's stuff. Lol... Just want to say... Don't know what I would do without this life saving calender. THANK YOU .
Too fast and too hard to play, don't like. Not one of the good fun games to play for me .
Not my kind of game. I like games like candy crash, pet rescue, & bubble witch saga games. And games on facebook .
The knife is great. It's a beast, though obviously it's no ka-bar. You get what you pay for. Downsides: the rubber handle smells awful and the sheath is a piece of crap. However if you're not planning on wearing it around, or worried about it's great looks, the sheath shouldn't be a factor .
Great piece of equipment. Cool design, and very easy to read even in harshly lit environments. I use it to tune my acoustic guitar. I haven't tried it on any other instruments, but it works well on guitar. I use it every day and have been for 5 months. It was well worth the purchase.Even when there are other instruments playing in the room, this little guy does a good job of picking out your instrument from the others. It may have picked up someone else's instrument once or twice in the time I've used it, but that's nothing in comparison to how much use I've got out of it.I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for an inexpensive, accurate tuner .
While these are great, durable weights and the rubber coating is quite helpful in preventing damage to the surfaces they're on, the rubber smell awful. I thought they'd air out a bit after I unwrapped them but it's been nearly a month and they still reek. This was highly disappointing, seeing as they were advertised as being made with oderless rubber. If they didn't smell so terrible, I'd give them a 5 star rating .
This is a fantastic mug. It can hold a lot, which I love. Gets lots of laughs from friends and families, and the company of this little icebat is always a welcome sight while sipping your morning tea or coffee. The only 'downside' is how much the mug weighs. It's fairly hefty, but not a problem at all, if you're not a sissy .
I hang it on to my back pack so it doesn't take up space. Comfortable,stays in place w/o moving about ; I'm able to sleep on long flights w/o having a sore neck . Almost makes flying a pleasurable experience .
Problem occurred in Morocco. The recipient didn't know how to set up an account although the explanation from Amazon was precise. Perhaps there was a language issue although I also translated it into French. I think culture  played a role. Don't think I will send a gift card to Morocco anymore;- .
I'll let you know AFTER I receive it ; can't evaluate it w/o seeing the color,touching and washing it OK .
Because it is delicious! Texture,taste and consistency great. I cannot buy this great cereal in any store near me in Pgh Pa.Thanks for making it available on line Norma .
This headset works well for the price I got it at. However, it does get static out of no where. Even sometimes it will drop all sound at random .
works great plugged right in and worked. The price is great and it was a shipped quick had it in 2 days.I looked at other sites but there prices didn't compare. It was linked to the battery I was shopping for also .
The battery came and hooked on the computer and charged it up.My old battery wouldn't hold a charge no longer this one works as long as the original battery did when new.. Nice to use the lap top unplugged from the charger again .
I love how relatable Praying Medic writes.He is a Christian and speaks to everyone, no Christianese here... just love, real life and divine healing. &#60;3If you are a healer, this will resonate... whatever your theology .
First I feel the Holy Spirit all over this book as I read! TYJ This is an excellent tool for all and rooted in the word. Great teachings to share with loved ones who may not understand how God speaks to us through dreams and visions. A door opener! &#60;3 &#60;3 &#60;3 .
These are a pair real nice boots, I like them a lot. They have a nice fit for a size 11 W. Plus for a price of under 60 bucks you can't go wrong .
This is an awesome watch, but the backlight is not bright enough.  Easy to set time and date; and links are easy to remove .
This book has surprises throughout!  It was written in such a way that I was drawn in and lost track of time.  Can't wait for the next book from Houston Gray, and definitely hoping for a sequel to this book .
The only memory this thing has is the impression you leave. Slept in it the first, left an impression in it, and that impression won't leave. A real piece of junk. Don't waste your money .
The reports are non-sensible. The 2 different CPA firm said this is the stupidest thing they ever seen. Don't waste your money .
Worked right out of the box. Does what it says. Handles videos great. I steam music endlessly for weeks, no hiccups yet .
I bought this hoping that it would work for my pc (dell xps13 ultrabook) so I could plug my computer into the tv in my dorm room.its great if you're not looking to break bank on something you think you need to buy from a big brand name. Just cuz its cheap doesn't mean its bad either, good quality and sturdy, small and easily put away.Great product, I'd recommend .
One of the very few apps I found that is not compatible with my tablet. I use Kindle for PC and and iPhone and all good. So I wanted to use it on my tablet too and it does not work with my Android tablet .
I originally bought this product because what woman out there doesn't like the sound of something that is going to take away from the time spent getting ready, am I right? Unfortunately, this was a terrible idea. I had recently colored my hair a dark burgundy and was in love with the color and the way that my hair was looking, but my local Walmart had the blow dry perfecter on sell and I  just had to try it. I eagerly went home and opened the box up and began to read the instructions. I was a little thrown off by the fact that you had to wear gloves to put this on your hair and that there was, as the booklet stated, "an odor" that was more like a stench than anything. I ended up shrugging off these thoughts as I began to imagine not having to re-straighten my hair regularly and applied the first tube to my hair. Twenty minutes later I rinsed it out, while doing so I noticed color was washing out of my hair as well, but I told myself it was only because I had recently colored my hair and it was no big deal so I applied the second tube and I thought everything was just fine. After everything was in I blow dried my hair only to find small pieces of my hair breaking off in the major side bang area of my hair as I brushed it out. This scared the life out of me. I finished it only to find my hair completely fried and the ends. Not only that, my hair color has almost completely left my hair in the area it was fried in, so I don't only have crispy ends, but it is also multicolored and ridiculous and since my hair is in such bad shape I cannot color it again in fear of causing more damage or it simply washing out as it did before. I would never recommend this product to anyone I liked. It is terrible and will do little to nothing for you besides ruin your hair .
Didn't fall in love with it but I like it. I would recommend it if you're into stealthy games. END .
This product did not work at all. Did not charge my iPod. Junk. Not worth the two dollars I paid for it .
Amazon did not send me the product in the Picture instead they sent me another product that was t he same brand but different specs. I returned it and when I got it back my surprise was that it was the same one I returned. Not satisfied at all .
They roll well and don't mark the floors and they were very easy to install.  I am very satisfied with them .
Works great per gift owner did not have any problems getting the merchandise came as described and very pleased with item .
This product was pretty cheap and really affordable. I feel like the picture is a little misleading. Its a little more purple than red. Its also not very comfortable and understuffed (by that I mean its not very firm and feels pretty empty when you sit on it).Not that thrilled about this purchase, but I shouldn't be that surprised in light of the fact that we got it for $200 ish.Thats all .
I saw this game at a vendor booth at Anime Boston, but wasn't ready to buy it at the time. It looked intriguing and fun, and colorful!Eventually, I did buy it and we played it the night it arrived. I love everything about this game .
I learned of the awesomeness that is french press brewed coffee a while ago (10 months or so?), and purchased a (relatively cheap) french press. It was glass, and it serviced me well until one morning when I went to use it, and found a hairline fracture curving around the bottom of the carafe. I was upset and ordered a new one. This one was also glass, but it was a style I had been eyeing for a while...and...I didn't need a &#34;big&#34; french press as I was the only one drinking coffee. This was a couple of months ago.Earlier this week, I woke up to make my coffee and sadly found my beloved french press sitting in the sink in pieces (it had been on the counter when I went to bed). I'm guessing that wind from the nearby open window knocked it over, but I will, unfortunately never know.Disgruntled and upset and *way* undercaffeinated, I came to Amazon and was delighted to see this french press. I've been considering Le Creuset products anyway, and have plans to replace my pots and pans over time. I am soon to no longer be the only coffee drinker in the house so the size was especially appealing.I love the feel of stability and solidness it has. Wind won't be blowing this over any time soon. I love the rich color (color is good!), and it's nice to have coffee sitting in something that isn't going to get cold all that quickly.I still have to figure out the right ratios of coffee to water to make *my* perfect brew, but I know that will come. In the meantime, even my slightly diluted cup yesterday tasted delicious .
I love it not only it will save me but it alerts emergency personel and my love one's.to know so they can educate themself about what is diabetes.. thank you .
To everyone that buys a tablet because is very nice and it will protect you're tablet and u can't beat the price .
reliable and trust worthy. Perfect package handling. i don't regret purchasing this product at all. I'll eventually come right here for my next phone case .
I had to return one of the stools that I bought & I bought another stool & they sent someone's return too me that had screw marks all up & down the cylinder!!!!!! It's a 60 mile round trip that cost me more money........ as far the stools I like them if you don't get some ones returns .
I used this wall adapter for a good while until I bought a surge protector. You may not want to use this adapter for televisions or expensive electronics but for basic cell phone charger and aroma plug-ins its great. Six regular sized plugs fit perfectly on the adapter but if you have a large plug, you may only fit 4. It all depends on the size of plug. It comes with the screw to secure it to the wall outlet. I like this adapter and would buy another one if needed .
I bought this item as a gift. It was a great item especially for the price! It looked like it is worth so much more than just $60. My husband likes to collect watches and this watch has been a great addition! It can be worn for regular business casual days or even those days when you are really trying to impress. We had to remove a few links since the band does come a bit big but that is a good thing since everyones preferences are different. From what he's told me, it is lightweight and not bulky but you do have to be careful since it scratches easily. Very happy with this purchase .
The item was delivered earlier than expected which was great. It was carefully packaging and the item was in mint condition from the outside. I have not opened it or watched it since it is a gift but expect to be more than satisfied once it is opened. I would certainly purchase other products from this seller .
These bands were bought to be used for the Insanity Asylum 2 workout. The red is the smallest, then yellow and then green is the largest. They have a lot of resistance but the red band was the one that was most used. Due to it being used a lot it snapped. I felt like it should have lasted much longer than just a few weeks but I'm not complaining. The yellow band is just as good. The bands are not expensive so I would definitely buy from this seller again .
Love it! We have the Keurig Vue 700 and this cup is perfect. We normally buy vue cups from Keurig but on those days that you run out of vue cups, this item is surely great to have. You can put your own type of coffee that you buy. The filter is gold-plated so it does not have that dull nasty taste that other refillable cups tend to have. The coffee still has a strong taste so it does not take away any of its potency. Since you use ground coffee inside the cup, you may get a few little grounds in your coffee. It is not to where they bother me. There are usually just a few and they usually stay on the bottom of the mug. The cup is easy to clean. I wouldn't recommend putting it in the dishwasher since it has small pieces. The top lid is detachable. You need to be very careful with the lid since it is fragile. The latch that keeps the container and the lid together is very thin and can break easily. If broken, it should still work. You would just need to make sure the lid is completely closed when you put it in the coffee machine. I absolutely love this item. It makes having a Vue coffee machine so much better since there are not that many vue cup coffee flavors available. With this item, I can still enjoy my favorite coffee .
This item was a gift. It has worked perfectly for the week or so that my husband has had it. He has downloaded many games onto it with no problem. It is an official SONY memory card. No complaints there. Overall, I am happy with the product just dissatisfied with the shipping issue that I had .
Stumbled upon this series and find them to be very entertaining. I love the fact that there is humor as well as mystery in the story. Can't wait to read the next book. This should be a movie or tv series .
Agnes and Eleanor are my heroines. These gals are spunky and smart. They always get their man in the end .
I like it, the price also cheap. Really worth buying this eye gel. Starting to use it, but don't know the effect yet .
This is a lovely piece to add to my porch.  It wasn't hard to put together, but you need a second person to help you and a rubber mallet came in handy too .
I have recived the converse shoe yesterday.. opened the box and took a close look at them, really do not like the finish and they really do not look original to me. i am thinking of returnig them .
The pencil looks really good... and the eraser does its job... Good Product all in all i am not sure if we can add any other eraser to that or if they are sold seperately .
I have been using those for 2 weeks now.. and this is what i wanna tell you:1. The range is good... i have not tried 23 Miles.. but tried it in the office/hotel/street.2. the sound quality is very good i have to say. (and very Clear and Loud)3. have never seen any droping in signal.4. when you are charging the sets; you better turn them off; other wise battery will not last for half a day.5. The LED shown on the cradle do not go off.. i am not sure why?? i leave it night to morning and they never go off or indicate that batteries are full.the products comes with the following:2 handsets2 batteries2 Clipers1 Charging station for the two handsets - you can also charge your sets using a miniUSB cable .
i have ordered to of these centrum as i read they are perfect for seniors... when the two packs were delivered i found that the Expiration date on the package DEC 2013. and the instructions state on tablet a day... it will not last for a year!!!!On the other side i have ordered same product but for women and it had an expiration date of APR 2014 .
the watch looks good... thought it might be a little heavy, but found out it is light and does not put your hand down...the watch comes in a nice TH box (looks Good for gifts) and a small cusion/pillow (white leather) + manual .
Love the scent - really like the way my hair feels after I've shampooed - don't like the other scents .
Very religious based. Bibles quotes, passages on Jesus, etc. This bias was not a part of the description or anywhere on the cover. Misleading .
Received the book in good time, BUT the cover did not have Lawernce's picture on the front cover as shown on the Amazon web site ..... Big DISAPPOINTMENT .
The pilot was excellent and can't wait too see the rest. I am had I decided to watch thus show and I loved the X-files so this show will be a guaranteed hit .
great storyline, NEVER lost interest and great acting.really looking forward to season 2. there IS a season 2 coming. right .
I gave this pilot 5 stars because as soon as it started it seemed like only 10 minutes before it was over.. Where and when is Ep 2??Lets hope it doesn't fizzle out like some of the others .
had my 40" Coby for 1 year and 1 month, or course 1 month past the warrenty.  it went complety out no sound no pic nothing.  Called Coby and they pretty much said sorry can't help.  I sent it to a guy to have it looked at and he found the problem by couldnt get the part.  Stay away from this brand of TV it is junk .
I bought this for a Christmas gift and they have not received it yet.  The quality of the box seems to be pretty sturdy and it was pretty.  The only problem I had with it is the little fairy that spins isn't real girly looking .
One of the greatest records of all time, the quality of the cover is amazing, high gloss with bright and vibrant colors, comes with a very nice sleeve for the LP, overall a no brainer for any rock music collection .
This brush has absolutely no place touching a record. The brush bristles fall out and get into the grooves, not to mention the scratching caused by this products WAY too rough bristles, its just a cheap foreign made piece of crap. Its not even worth $5 let alone $25 .
This fragrance has always been one of my favorites and I was happy to find it on amazon.com. So I ordered it and it arrived very soon, carefully packed. However, it turned out that the bottle's cap was broken inside so it couldn't be kept properly in its place, and there was also a plastic part that apparently fell out from the cap and created some noise i could hear before I opened the box. Consequently the bottle cannot be closed as it's usually expected. But the fragrance itself is the same chic and romantic one I have always known. And it does last during the whole day .
The product is not as good as I expected because the color of the leather it is made of is uneven: in different places (especially on sides) it varies from dark to lighter brown though it doesn't catch the eye immediately. It is quite visible only if you carefully examine the thing. Besides there are scratches inside on lining as if it has been kept in the same place and position for years. Generally the bag looks all right but the quality is far from excellent .
Wool is known as a most suitable fabric for winter clothes - warm, lightweight  and natural. This cap is no exclusion - it's perfect for cold weather, one can feel absolutely safe in it, it gives a cold no chance to be caught by the person wearing it .
I like the item immensely! The leather is so soft and pleasant to touch! Indeed, it is a great thing  and looks really wonderful! Besides there's a lot of room inside, it's well-organized! I'm happy to get it! You can't go wrong with this purchase .
My order was delivered today, quite soon and safe. The berries are very palatable and soft, bigger in size than I used to buy, maybe they are a little under dried. I add them to my breakfast porridge or cottage cheese or quark -they all taste perfectly. There's information about the product's quality on the package but no origin indication at all. But anyway I loved them .
My order arrived very fast. The mold would be great if it was larger. I didn't expect it to be so small despite the measurements given in the item description. I can't imagine baking such a small portion, there should have been at least three of them making a set. I wouldn't recommend it because it's very inconvenient to heat the oven for baking such a small thing .
I've been using the product on different eyes including my own, and it always looks splendid though it doesn't feature a lot of shimmer, just a slight hint, it is almost matte. Due to this it can be used by young girls as well as sophisticated women with the same winning effect! Wonderful and universal color! It may seem small but the eyeshadow is more than enough to be used for quite a long time, I personally have it for 1.5 year (of cause i do not use the same color every day, but even the light eyeshadows which i do use more often have not been ended within the same timeframe) and it is still more than 2/3 of its size left! The color has a very tiny structure and consistency so it can be applied with an extremely thin layer to complement any eyes. I have almost every color of Mary Kay mineral eyeshadows and never regret that I bought them .
If it was slightly larger it would be great, the color is deeper online, in person it turned out to be not so rich but nice. And it's very warm, I was wearing this beret all the cold days in January and there's absolutely nothing to complain - it does its work .
Gorgeous earrings!!! I've just received them and can't help admiring! The earrings are so solid, well-made and look so great! They are even better than expected! The only thing is that the hooks are quite sharp so be careful. There are also an extra rubber/silicone pair of safety backs which is very nice and useful.I would definitely recommend this product. Thanks .
It is very warm and lightweight. If you happen to be caught by snow, the cap won't get wet through and will be dried very soon by itself - great quality for a winter cap! I would recommend it to boys as well as adults .
I've been using the product for quite a long time. It's wonderful and I can't do without it! I'll surely buy it again and again when I run out of this! I highlight with this powder the under eye area and small lines to make them less visible on and it's perfect for this purpose! I don't know another one of such quality for the money paid .
I liked the result of this soap's work generally, but it didn't help my silk pillowcases (i bought this Charlie soap for my silk bedding) which I washed with it - they remained greasy. I can't use stain remover on silk or treat it with high temperature and this purchase had to help me to keep things immaculate but it failed to serve its purpose. So I wouldn't call it outstanding. Just an ordinary detergent .
The chain is very beautiful and shiny due to its cut and looks great with my 1 inch pendant it was chosen for. It's thinner than it might seem online, it's obviously not 1.1mm but it worked for me .
I bought this adapter to replace my old one which couldn't have been fixed. I love it because it's easy to use and does its work as expected. Thanks .
The quality seems good. But I didn't realize the molds would be different colors: most of them are red, but some of them are orange - and so small. Of course, they haven't been used yet, maybe there would be no need in bigger ones .
It's excellent, has a good traction, very lightweight, the size is right, the width can be easily fixed by laces. Good deal for the money!It's only been less than a month time my husband wears the soccer cleat to his games  once per week and the soles have already started coming unstuck on both cleats! That's absolutely unacceptable! It turns out I bought this pair only for 4 games. That's ridiculous! I can't buy cleats every month, they are quite pricey for such a poor quality! I don't think any more that it  was a good deal(I didn't expect that at all. Frustration!That's the reason I changed my opinion on the item .
I bought them for my son, he had chosen them by himself. They are beautiful, very comfy and light, easy to play while wearing and meet all my son's expectations. He's happy with the purchase!After three months of wearing them for his games the soles have been worn to holes) in the toe area - that's very disappointing, I didn't expect that at all from Nike!  So I have to buy another pair again .
They came very soon after the purchase! I can't help admiring with these wonderful pillowcases: they are so smooth, pleasant to touch, beautiful! I must admit that now I definitely sleep better and never have &#34;pillow face&#34; while sleeping on them. These are my first pair of silk pillowcases, I have never owned silk bedding, so had nothing alike to compare with. I bought them (2 sets) to start with though I have always known that silk is the best fabric featuring amazing hygroscopic qualities. Worth every penny paid for them!!! Love, love, love! Highly recommend this product to everyone .
I'm so happy with this product! The safety backs are very good quality, they serve perfectly their purpose, no sliding at all. I replaced all my earrings post backs with these and feel they keep the earring secure on the ears. I would definitely recommend them to everyone .
The headband is very comfortable and beautiful. I especially loved the wide elastic band which keeps it almost unnoticeably (neither tight nor loose)  just in the right place .
I loved these glasses the very moment I opened the package. They arrived in a beautiful hard case, that's very convenient because there's no need to search for it and spend more money. The glasses are excellent. The color isn't bright (I was afraid it would be too bright), it's not as dull as black, and I like it. They are meant for a gift and I hope they will be loved by the future owner.I would recommend these elegant glasses to ladies .
This is a very healthy addition of antioxidants to our table, all the family members love these palatable berries so I buy them from time to time. They taste good, maybe a bit more over dried than I tried before but that's not a problem. You can even make a tea using them .
I ordered 4 of these scarves, different patterns, but I've received one incorrect pattern - Animal Red Print - instead of Colorful Cat Pattern Print. If it wasn't for the color which isn't as bright as needed, it would be good. It can definitely add a zest to your image. The scarf I've got looks nice but doesn't serve my purpose so I contacted the seller and asked for replacement. The seller was very fast to reply and polite and offered me a refund or replacement. As I realized that the size is too small, having seen them in person, I decided to replace the 4 scarves for one long (I also bought one long scarf from this seller, which is very beautiful and right size). Thank you, T&C; Mall.If you decide to order these scarves, you should be aware that they are small, exactly as advertised 20" by 20". It can only once be tied around the neck, if you decide to make a knot, there almost wouldn't be loose ends. It could fit a tiny young girl but not a corpulent lady.  Besides, due to the delicate nature of the silk fabric, there might be some defects in finishing/seams. It absolutely does not apply to that particular scarf I received in a wrong pattern, but some of the others I received, have some imperfections on the corners or edges. But I like all the patterns, it was difficult to choose, they are so original and fresh and they do attract attention .
Worst purchase i made with amazon..  I always order enamel gent lease for my newborn but this time the formula was not good he always spit out all his milk and always cry i think the product had some problem and than i try gent lease from local grocery store it was all fine my son was comfortable and never spit his milk.. Will never order my baby product from amazon .
It is very nice for the price and easy to assemble.No paint is also a plus for those worried about toxins in finishes and plastics .
Great book easy to follow I am a master of paracord this was a great place to start. Really was a true beginers book never did paracord before got book .
On the fence not sure is as good as thought to save a half cigar. Was cheap so you be the judge .
This is not real shrinky dink needs to be listed that way. Don't work right can't use colored pencils. Not for kids, spend the extra money and get the right real stuff .
Might seem to be made well but that's about all. The thing never got to the right humidity nor will it hold it. What a waste of my money guess got a paperweight don't buy .
This case looks cool but is a very cheap made case offers no protection for your phone I wouldn't recommend it when can get an otter box for same price .
Ok product doesn't really offer the sound would hope for. Would be nice if an sound file would be with discription. Cheap made plastic as well. Had to make my own mounts spend more for better ones .
This product comes with no real directions there is no info can find online to help hook up. This was a cheap product but don't waste your time. Would of cost me $60 to have installed plus the money spent on unit. Don't bother spend the $100 I did and get one with remote start and everything installed .
Really was a junk battery didn't last very well don't be fooled by cost you get what pay for beware .
The case is great very heavy duty and good. Kids love it, got here faster them estimated cheap price.  The case is very good quality my little one has dropped it with no damage to phone .
The good, well made easy to use right out of the box. The bad, unless you know how to use and make stuff there a no direction as to how to use. For me I knew how to make stuff, other then the monkey fist, but found how on you tube .
The beads are good quality great price not ones I thought smaller and little harder for 550 paracord but good quality and price .
Not as good as original one, slow warm up time. Spend the little more get one that comes from toshiba instead .
I have never even considered writing a review for a book, but I couldn't pass up the chance to review The Language of Sparrows. My dinky little review  could never do this beautiful story justice, though; this tale is poetic, intense, and moving, complete with characters who really seem to come alive. If you enjoy faith fiction with a real message, read this book. I'll definitely be looking for more books by Rachel Phifer .
it was really difficult to use, almost time can not be charging.And looks like used one, not the new one .
I found this book interesting and effective. At first reverting back to the eating habits of my ancestors sounded like a strange way to get healthy. Don't we know more about a healthy diet today then we did in the past? It turns out that it's all about focusing on foods that are body is made to naturally process. Many modern day foods that result from farming were not originally intended for human consumption. By returning to early day staples such as meat, eggs, and fish, while avoiding man made chemicals and products, we can actually be much healthier. The list of things you give up seems intimidating at first, lord knows I love my sugar, but Chatham lays out a very simple plan that makes the adjustment surprisingly easy. His list of meal plans and recipes are very extensive, and easy to follow. He acknowledges that your change in lifestyle will be a challenge, but does a great job of giving specific tips to make it easier. I enjoyed the book, but enjoy my newfound health even more .

EASY TO READ AND POSITION WHERE YOU WANT.  A GOOD ADDITION TO MY AQUARIUM AND VERY HANDY FOR THOSE WHO CAN'T SEE THE LITTLE FLOATING THERMOMETERS (LIKE ME .
WOW!  WHAT A FIND, IT WORKS JUST AS THEY SAY.  IT CAN BE A LITTLE HARD TO PUCH DOWN SOMETIMES, BUT IT MAKE THE JOB A BREAZE. I LOOK FORWAD TO EATING A MANGO, UNLIKE BEFORE, I DIDN'T LOOK FORWARD TO ALL THE WORK .
The quality of this is great. Easy to use, and answer the phone. Nice cover, I don't have to worry about my phone when I toss it in my purse .
From the time we got it out of the box, Hummer was in heaven. He plays and sleeps all day long on this, though the color of green was not as expected, we still enjoy it .
This was a great book. This id the first book I read by this author. When I was younger my grandmother always read Danielle Steel books. I thought if my grandmother read them then I wouldn't like them. I was wrong this was a great book, very heartfelt and a great book to read during the holidays. I loved it .
this is a good Generator it is quiet running easy on fuel not so very heavy to load to haul .
I just received the miku nendoroid in the mail and it was not the real one. I was seriously disappointed. It was a lot of money for a fake, and next time I want to buy a nendoroid I will look somewhere else .
I was hesitant about buying an entire album because of two or three songs that I like. I took a chance and was not disappointed.  This album rocks .
Way Too Expensive For What It Is, Dogs Won't Go near It, Don't Buy!! Expensive Shipping and Product Very Cheaply Made .
This PokeBall Is Great I Caught Zapdos With It, Isn't That great.I Tried the Great ball but it didn't work .
It broke the very first day,when I put it on the front of the case broke.Built very weak.never even got to use it .
The flashlight i had before this one wasn't that bright and this one is exactly what i was looking for .
It blow drys my hair pretty well. However, it is heavy. I usually section my hair off to get it as straight as I can before flat ironing it. With this blow dryer I tend to just blow dry a entire section because it's so heavy. I wanted my own hair dryer instead of having to use my mothers. Sometimes I want to go back to using her hair dryer because it isn't as heavy .
It's the right amount of heat for my hair. I have very thick hair and the flat irons I was using before this one weren't getting hot enough to really do anything for my head. Definitely a great buy .
I'm no hair stylist but I try to do what I can without going to a shop. The curls hold up with some spritz, but if I wasn't using that they would be gone in a matter of an hour or so .
I've been trying to find a good shampoo and conditioner for my daughters her. She's 16mon old and has kinky hair. It has a tendency of looking dry and pretty much sucking up every bit of grease I put in it. I ran across this product in Walmart near their sulfate free haircare section and thought I'd give it a try. First off it smells good. Second right after the first wash on her hair i noticed how soft her hair was. She doesn't really have a curl it's more of undefined curls that evolve into an afro when dry. And it gets all hard and dry like I said.  So it being that soft was surprising to me. I went ahead washed it a second time and then conditioned it. The hair was still very soft and when I combed it it was a lot easier then it normally is. I usually have to use a detangling spray but this time I didn't. Styling was a breeze as well n her hair had a shine n moist look to it without me adding anything else. Overall this is a good product for kids. I would recommend it to others. So far I've only tried the shampoo and conditioner .
When I first ordered this I got a 32 and it was wayyy to small. I couldn't even hook it. So I sent it back and got a 36 and it fits as it's suppose to. I have a deep line in the middle of my stomach that shows through every thing so when I put a shirt on over the shaper it shows. Especially if it's a tight fitted shirt. However, this definitely does work .
Strategic Management SPOMP is a must-read for every Project Manager who wants to learn more about creating the necessary support for successful projects. In PM education we are always told that we have to involve stakeholders and that we need to create support. That was it. No book teached us HOW to do it. With Strategic Management SPOMP Hielkema provides us with very powerfull tools to fill this gap. He explains in a very logical and simple way how politics in organizations works and how we can use these forces to our advantage. One of the most usefull and practical books I've read in years .
my husband picked it out to keep his feet and legs warm. He actually has not yet tried them on yet .
bought these before but this pair is so very wide that I do not know if I will be able to wear them but my previous ones were so good that I wanted another pair. They are very comfortable and durable shoes .
I tried this but found it did not work. I prefer using urine off . My vet suggested it when this product did not help .
I tried it and it did not help control my cats actions at all. This was a waste of money .
The movie was just bad.  Give it a razzie.  It wasn't very funny and was sophomoric.  Luke Wilson should look for movies with more substance .
This case fits nice and not as bulky as my old case.  Fits snug, but easy to put on.  No screen protector, but they are pretty inexpensive to purchase separately.  The pink is not as bright as pictured, but not a big deal to me .
no problems with the product and my children simply love to play against each other.  This would not have been possible without this simple addition to the purchase if the console which only has 1 remote .
I have been using this television for about a month now with no problems.  Colour and clarity is good with volume that fills the room. I expected no less though. I have not yet explored any special features it may have, so a further update may be required .
Works very well. Best off brand controller I've had. Does as described. There isn't much more to say about it .
I like the rug, but it looks alot bigger in the pic. I'm not good with measurements, but the rug is only big enough to go under my rectangular coffee table with just a little room left over.My friend said it looks nice, and my cat seems to fancy it. I'm going to purchase another one to go over my futon as decoration .
Just as described and shipping was fast.  Realize that your GTI may not have holes in the rear bumber.  The dealer may have just drilled some sheet metal screws into your bumper.  So keep that in mind when mounting this plate.  The bolts that come with it may not fit into your bumper because the bumper doesn't come ready for a rear plate .
Designed well. Does not match necklace if you expect them to be a &#34;set&#34;.  Disappointed they were not even close on the shade of green .
No glare or fingerprints on my screen!  Great since I read a lot on my phone. Much much better than screen cover which comes standard with the new phone. Won't use anything else .
Not too big. Not too small. Inside pocket holds my iPhone, plenty of slots for cards & ID, drivers license, etc. Great hands-free function. Good grade leather .
Could not put it down. Haven't read a good book in a while. It is close to battle royal and the hunger games and yet slightly different .
Nice price doesn't fit as snug as original one but works Fine thank u  so if my 3yr pulls the plug it doesnt hurt the laptop lol .
Super cute!!! I expected since it was cheaper in price that the detailing would be that great, but lemme tell you! It comes as shown, looks better than the picture from my perspective! It does take a while for you to get it after ordering (took about three weeks), but on the brighter side of things is it came two days earlier than they predicted. It's got cute gold/copper, rose and light pink detailing and a slightly rustic looking copper chain that (just a heads up to other future buyers) doesn't unclasp. I didn't realize when I first bought it that you are just supposed to slip it over your head, and that there wasn't a clasp. Not a big deal to me at all, the chain is long enough that it slips over my head easily (up-dos might be a bit tricky though) so I don't mind it at all. Definitely my new go-to necklace .
I really was disappointed when the actor that played the president was gone as well as Jack's daughter. Not as good as season's 1, 2 and 3 .
I immediately loved it! A little bigger than I'm used to and a little more bling than I'm used to but I'll get used to it! I have to keep telling myself that I deserve it! I am a lover of watches and I've had so many but none like this one! I hope it doesn't scratch to easily or turn my wrist green! We will see .
Wasn't sure that I wanted to get involed with another series but my sister suggested it and she is not a TV watcher so I knew it had to be good! She was right .
I honestly wish I hadn't read this book. This book left me feeling empty and cheated. It's a pretty good read but a horrible finish. Not worth the time .
This product stopped working after a couple months , it doesn't charge nor does it charge my phone anymore. I do not recommend you purchase this at all. I want my money back ASAP .
Honestly they are pretty cool considering I love the Yin Yang. But I don't think they were worth the price for only 4 stickers. I mean yeah I did buy it, but it's because it was the cheapest option for simply Yin Yang stickers .
I love the color considering teal/aqua blue is my favorite color. The only problems I have with it is actually getting the darn thing off and how much more bulky it makes my MacBook Pro with Retina. I am in love with the computer's original thinness, but I am not impress with how much thicker the case adds so I only use the cover for the screen and not the bottom casing .
Unwind is a great book I can't seem to stop reading once I start reading. I read every book of the series I am just waiting for the book undivided to come out .
This case is a great buy. Love everything about it. Love the fit and feel of the case. I love how it snaps and holds on tightly to the tablet. I feel comfortable carrying it around knowing that it won't fall out. The stand works great too. For being such a slim case, the functions are great. I think it was a great buy .
it is useless has no power for the smallest jobs I put it in the trash cart with other junk .
On the recommendation of a friend, I used this on my 12 year old Boxster.  The rear window on the convertible top had a very noticeable &#34;smoky&#34; look all along the window, right where the window folds.  I've used Plexus on it three times now and it's about 95% of how it looked off the showroom.  Really a great product.  (You know it's good stuff when they tell you &#34;don't use paper towels!&#34 .
This book not only grabbed my attentionIt throttled me and hung me from my own expectations and excitementsFANTASTICthe greatest book for those  that may not have the highest self esteem and ANYONE else .
its like there isn't enough power its very hard to get this thing to blend anything!idk if its a deffective blender baised on the other reviews ppl seem to love it? idk what happened but bought another one works wayyyyy betterthe plastic part smells after a couple uses .
ive tried this two times now and its my first time ever playing with toys its feels good sometimes makes it too big but no complaints came fast was cheap good quality .
Wes does an excellent job of creating simple and effective strategies to attain success in the direct sales industry. His extensive experience and knowledge is useful not only to those new to the industry, but for top income earners as well. His book also dispels many of the stigmas and misinformation that has been associated with direct sales. Overall it was an outstanding read and I would recommend this book to anyone who want to take their career to the next level .
I felt that it was hard to put down and i can't wait for the next one hurry up please .
Loved  this book have all previous  in series love the characters  like the past and present story lines love the way all the many characters evolve throughout each book. Can't wait for the next one. Couldn't out it down .
I didn't like how the book started but once I got in the middle I couldn't stop!! You might have to read it in high school so be prepared lol .
Its not the greatest controller in the world.it doesn't respond now and then and turns if on its own.the sticks are clunky and stiff. But if you just want a cheap alternative to a controller this is your item .
Sound quality is high comparable to my other earphone audio technica ath-ckm55.  I found some minor problems 1. slight humming sound when plugged to a notebook and the power adapter does not have an earth pin but is eliminated if plugged to a printer with a power source with an earth pin.  2. Sound can appear very garbled if the earphone jack 3.5 mm is plugged in certain positions.  The microphone can be used for some other models not mentioned including LG-P990 but definitely not nokia (not included as one of the compatible phones) - not even as purely an earphone. Included adapter for skype & other VOIP connections is much appreciated.  Furthermore, the company help website manager was very proactive in seeking a solution for my problems .
I am buying from NZ. Bought this as the price was attractive but eventhough internal US postage is free, after allowing for postage via a forwarder, the savings is negligible compared to the best priced online vendor in NZ.  The one bought from NZ gives one-year warranty and one would need to buy a NZ power supply (240V) to power it as the 110V US would not work in NZ and the power adapter bought separately with shipping can come up to half the price of the whole unit .
Doesn't work well. I'd suggest to spend more and get other ones, Braun SE 5280 Silk Epil 5 Epilator With Ice Glove is much better .
This phone case is nice but 1. missing pen and 2. color of inside part is black, not like on the picture. I ll be happy if you send me pen as well.Black Wallet PU Leather case Card Holder Flip Case Cover for Samsung i9300 Galaxy S3 III .
the biggest problem with this cooker is water overflows when cooking rice and makes a big mess in the microwave, I never had that problem with my earlier cooker set. Other than this its very much alright for pasta and everything else .
it really has a good clarity and battery back up is just fine..... however if we consider this for running in a gym it won't help, although we can walk on inclination while using this bluetooth head set .
Its not very costly compared to other case, its a good buy for the dollars spent, the flip option is quite useful some times .
I wasn't sure whether I should download the soundtrack from iTunes or to order the album, but I decided to order it. I was VERY happy with the outcome! I thought the case might be thrown together with the disk, but no! It's got a great Broadway booklet filled with pictures from the production, and the soundtrack itself is astounding! I listen to it every single day, and when I'm to it it's playing beautifully in my mind! I love it, it's fantastic, and I HIGHLY recommend it .
I could not get the application to respond with a finger touch.  It said I had to buy a voice activator to get it to work.  That is why I gave it such a poor rating and deleted it from my Kindle.  It was not FREE like advertised .
my printer would show low on ink then wound not work reinstall it and it did the same thing not wourth it .
This is a rather well done piece of highly posable plastic. I love the weapon selection, shield designs (that are straight from the movie!) and the extra bits like the base.Shipping was very fast too, so kudos to the seller.My two complaints are:1) The scale. It makes it gargantuan for display with gijoe\SW figures and somewhat of a midget alongside 6&#34; scale stuff like DCUC or MOTUC (and many, many more besides).2) The price: it is still rather expensive, honestly.I do not regret buying one (indeed I am pretty happy about it), but would not track some more down, like I originally wanted to, because of those issues .
Not worth the money very cheap material... I should have read all the reviews and bought something different elsewhere for less money .
I bought the item and it was shipped without a remote.  After finding out it went through Amazon directly I called them and they told me that they would send out a replacement but they never did:(  When I called back they said that I had to return the whole thing be refunded and order a new one.(A lot of work has to go into saving $5).  The product works okay but has an annoying buzzing sound when it rings .
Keeps you excited about what is coming next. A really great read, can't wait for the next one. I am excited to see what will become of Lazy .
So good I didn't sleep until I finished the book! Dark circles to prove it! Loved Tristan Stone! I admit it didn't make sense the first half of the book. Him I mean and his actions, but OMG! It all gets cleared up by the middle to end of the book so stick it out! Worth it! OMG! The ending was a jaw dropper! Not what I think is a cliffhanger, because there is a great epilogue that sets up book 2. I'm planning to read it again before her next book comes out. I love when a good book continues in a series! It's like a drug! lol .
Spending around 22 hours to build this magnificant set was well worth the time and effort. A daunting task at first but as each level grew, the more amazing this thing became. Each scene was well put together and fun to play with. So many characters are included in this set (you get 3 Luke's) that it makes it more fun.The price was the best compared to any other sellers online who would ship to Australia. (Buying it here would've cost me double!!) Shipping was really fast and came in great condition,my only problem was getting it inside as this set is so heavy! I can't wait to break it down and build it again... but not anytime soon .
love this product. the hd color is outstanding. i would recomend it anyone.  there is only 1 thing , it takes longer than expected to charge and does not indicate that its charging .
This was an amazing in depth look at life as seen through a very courageous and caring person. I don't believe it just speaks about his life but many that have served present and past .
I am a Paramedic that works 24 hr shifts, some of those shifts we have no down time and are wearing our boots the entire 24 hrs. These socks were very comfortable and my feet were cool .
I didn't buy this item on Amazon, but when I buy products I like to check Amazon for customer reviews to make sure I'm not wasting my money. I was pleased that this item was on Amazon, but there were no reviews! Bummer! So... I thought a lot about it, and bought it anyway. I got it for a FANTASTIC deal, cheaper than on the UV nails site and on Amazon, but Amazon does offer a great deal. When I ordered this set, there was no option to choose colors, even though they offer 3 colors along with the kit. In the notes I requested specific colors, when it arrived I was pleasantly surprised that they actually fulfilled my request rather than sending me default basics with the kit. I now just wish I would have spent more time looking at their color selections than just picking a few quickly, thinking they would just send me whatever anyway.Other than that, I'm very satisfied with the product, I just need more personal experience working with gel nail polish, as I am no nail tech. However, I have no other gel nail products/sets to compare this to, but I'm a happy customer.As advice to anyone looking to buy this set, or other products from this vendor, they sell their products cheaper on amazon than they do on their own site. Another reason why I love Amazon! :)EDIT!! As an update to what I previously thought about this set... I thought it was great when I first got it... And not being super familiar with gel sets I thought it was a great deal. However, I think anyone looking to start doing their own gel nails at home, buy a lamp, but avoid this set. The polishes are crap. The first few times I did my nails I thought maybe they were just coming off so fast because I was new to gel nails, but after switching brands and then experimenting with the UV Nails brand products again, I would stay away from their products, even the colors. I still use the lamp, but I've switched to Gelish brand polishes. When using the UV Nails brand polishes, the polish comes off in a few days. It reminds me of when your standard polish is too thick, and after a few days how it just comes off like a rubbery sheet. Don't waste your money, find a cheap lamp on amazon or ebay or where ever, but I totally recomment Gelish when it comes to the polishes and such .
Seems to be a real high quality suit, but I don't think the normal suit rules apply when deciding your suit size .
This is a dream product. The CarbonPak is everything an avid camper is looking for. The CarbonPak provides charge for an iPhone 5 about 8 and a half times with its 12000 mAh battery. That's remarkable compared to the IMP50D which charges an iPhone 5 about 3 and a half times with its 5000 mAh battery. The CarbonPak features a dual USB ports at outputs of 1A and 2.1As for phones and tablets. I've used this over weekend camping trips and had plenty of charge left in the device to continue into the next week. What is also great about this device is its automatic shutoff circuit installed into the device. On the IMP50D, to activate charging, you press the button and the lights will turn on and remain on, same with charging, until you press the button to turn it off once again. With the CarbonPak, the lights and charging sequence only remain on for a few seconds. When the circuit senses nothing drawing a charge, it automatically turns off. This saves the battery and makes this device extremely efficient. When my iPhone 5 was plugged into the CarbonPak, and reached 100% and began to trickle charge, the CarbonPak shutoff, automatically preserving the battery of the device, which I think is amazingly efficient and great for plugging my devices in before going to sleep on campouts. Another key feature that I find a great addition compared to the IMP50D, is the way this device charges. This device charges using a standard Micro USB, instead of Mini USB. This makes it easy for me to just plug my CarbonPak right into any of my older phone chargers or even my Android tablet chargers. In size comparison to the IMP50D, the CarbonPak is only a slight bit bigger because of its larger battery. One thing that would be a great addition, would be making this device able to charge using 2 amps input. Overall, I would call this product an absolute beauty and definitely worth the purchase. I gladly give this product 5 stars .
I bought this case with high hopes. It failed my expectations. The magnet designed to sleep and wake my nexus 7 is not properly placed in the right location, rendering the case useless. I would not buy this case if you expect the magnet to wake and sleep the nexus .
NT80CFor the NT80C, one thing that I noticed, is that it fits into the socket, but feels loose. That I believe has to do with the short, square shaped body. Another thing is that the lights built into the lightning bolts on either side of the charger, aren't very bright. For daylight use, it's hard to see if the plug is active, and at night, it is a soft low light glow that isn't very distracting, but does make it harder to find the USB slots without the use of a separate light. The NT80C has a shorter body compared to the NT88C, which is nice for cars with sockets that are set slightly into the dash. Cars with sockets that are set deeper into the dash, it may make it harder to reach the USB outlets. The NT80C also has a nice "Y" shaped design to allow for the plugs to be separated to keep the cables from tangling, but the "Y" shaped design becomes almost useless when you have an outlet set deep into the dash and to one side. This makes for the USB closest to the wall of the dash hard to access. This charger puts out a lower charge output of 1 amp per USB, for a combined output of 2.1 Amps. This charger can charge 2 phone simultaneously, but only 1 tablet at a time, and there is a nice information card to let you know this inside the packaging. From what I've seen with this car charger, I give the NT80C a rating of 4 stars.NT88CAs for the NT88C, the body is longer, but feels more sturdy when placed into the outlet. The USB slots are stacked on top of each other, which may make it hard to reach the bottom plug without twisting the charger. It has a nice lighted rim that can be seen in the daytime, as well as not being too bright and too distracting at night. Because of the longer body, it may not fit flush to the dash of some cars, and it could be made slightly shorter so that it can be set flush into the dash. This charger puts out a nice dedicated 1 Amp, and 2.1Amps for quick powerful charging. Combined, it gives you 3.1 Amps of charging power. There was no information card to let you know what it can charge, but based off the specs, I would guess 2 phones simultaneously, and a tablet and a phone simultaneously. I wouldn't recommend charging 2 tablets off of this charger, as it may not handle the power requirements. If an information card were to be included to tell a buyer what could and should be charged off of this charger would be a great addition to the package. Based off of my findings, I give the NT88C a rating of 4 stars.Both the NT80C and NT88C have a stylish look to them, and come with a Micro USB cable for in-car use. So overall for the purchase of both, I give them a combined score of 4 Stars .
My hair hasn't grown all the way back yet...and my hair color is still grey. I have a bald spot on the nape of my neck .
This came SO fast! I bought it as a Christmas gift for a very good friend, and she loved it! So I couldn't be any happier. It was in GREAT condition, brand new, and was wrapped up tight.  c .
I was a little nervous, I've never bought hand cream before, and I wasn't too sure how my skin would react to it. Well, Etude doesn't upset. I'm allergic to perfumes, and many types of lotions. My skin will break out easily, especially my hands. However, this smells like flowers almost, not too strong and almost natural-like, and my skin LOVES it! It came super fast and feels super soft! I totally recommend this for anyone and everyone .
These are for a cosplay, they aren't the colour I though (black) but they fit nice. And they were only like...$10 after my trade-in giftcard. I really like them, they are beautiful .
I bought this for my steampunk poison ivy cosplay, and boy am I happy! It's long, curly, and RED. Just like in the picture. It fits really nice, and I can tighten it if I feel it's sliding off. And one thing I look for in my wigs is comfort & non-itch, this is both of those. That and the material of the hair is soft, and it's thick, so the cap won't show. I'm very pleased with this wig .
Comfy and comfy and COMFY! This shirt deserves all 5 stars! It was nice and cheap, came fast, and fits PERFECTLY! It's nice for the 30 degree Florida weather, with no jacket over it. It's loose where it needs to be, but holds in heat. I couldn't be more happy with anything! I am thoroughly pleased with it! I can wear it out and about, lazing about at home, and even to the gym! c .
Gosh, I watched this commercial and saw Dakotakoti use this! I've always wanted it, but it's really hard to find it for some reason. So when I found this I NEEDED it! It came relatively fast, and it does exactly what the commercial says it does! It most definitely made my lashes big! No need for falsies now! Ahaha &#9829 .
This headband is totally perfect. It's a little tight, but what else can be expected, it's a metal head band. Overall, it's cute and shiny. It gets the &#34;cat-ear&#34; job done, and I couldn't be more happy with it. It came in nice and fast and that's all I can ask for. c .
It's super long, and super soft! And when it came in it was really curly and beautiful and.... unf... I am so happy! I have no issue with the amount of time it came in. I ordered this with a WHOLE bunch of other things, and it came in last, but I wasn't in any kind of rush. It fits amazingly, it's not itchy, and I love it.&#9829 .
My thighs are a little big, but it's fine I'm working on making them smaller, but the material is nice and soft, and they look great on my best friend. If you have larger thighs, like between sizes 7+ they might not be for you unless you plan on working out a bit. But my friend is a size 0-3 and he looks great in them. I recommend to the smaller group (I wish I could recommend to the &#34;average&#34; size .
work perfectly, very low in price. Don't know how long they last, but have had them for a month and used them for 20+ hours so I don't see them dying any time soon .
The original is a very catchy song (I love it).The remixes are good (even if i think they're a little bit too long!), I prefer the thunderpuss club mix (very dance) but the David Morales one is nice with the piano introduction .
I love Kelly Rowland, but with this one, I am a little bit desappointed. It's not my favourite CD.I didn't find some songs better than the others... So, it's a good one (very urban r'n'b) but not her best .
Well built quality product! My girlfriend loves them on her civic! Very happy they are metal and not cheap plastic! Will be getting a set for my car, just not in pink! Lol .
Maybe I just got the one bad lemon but it cost me a 45 dollar install and 15 bucks to ship it back! The display didn't work and what did come through the new speakers I bought was terrible! It truely was what it's called, only spelled differently! The only good thing was the seller, they were very helpful and prompt with my refund! AAA customer service .
It does not fit the Ipod 4 perfectly it does in fact slide out when opened. Even then the thing seems/feels off. I wouldn't even try putting more then one card into the slots.............. If your looking for something cheap then go ahead and get this but, if you want something to work 100% look for something better .
I just got this shirt today and its looks just like expected. I can't wait to wear it when it stops being so hot .
I love the shirt its what I expected. Took awhile to get here in fact the last day it said I could get it would be june 28 which is way too long just glad it didn't take that long but, this shirt is pretty good I'm loving it .
Its PlayStation wat do u expect nothing but the best for a great price unlike wat GameStop tried to do hit me with double the price that's right almost $800. I love Amazon .
I have never read anything like this story before, and I was kinda iffy already when I purchased it. Up until reading this book I was a one tracked mind with my love stories and I am so happy I got this! Everyone should read this book. I believe you get how love can either really destroy you or lift you up. It was amazing .
This is an amazing counterpart to this series. I love the idea of Rachel and Daniel from the very beginning. From their toddler days to them being best friends now- it was them leading up to this great love. I also love how truly best friends they were with Maggie, never abandoning her when her love was dwindling. I just love this novella .
His voice is as beautiful as ever. I would buy anything he chooses to make. No one can sing like Johnny Mathis, his voice was truly made in Heaven .
It was showing the videos fine and then when I tried finishing my show the screen was blank. I was very excited about having Netflix on my kindle and now it will not show anything. Please fix this .
The Giver offered a world some people long for and others will fear. The people in the book believe they live a perfect society. No one wants for basic needs like food and shelter. Everyone has an assigned job, and knows what events they should experience with each stage of their life. Everyone is essentially the same. Only one person knows all of the beauty and sorrows of the world, the Giver. And he is about to give that knowledge away to Jonas, the new receiver. As Jonas gains knowledge and memories from the Giver, he begins to worry about all that the community gives up in order to acheive the sameness they live in. Is the lack of fear about war and poverty worth the loss of color and love?This book will make you think about the changes in our own society, and what they might bring. A great way for kids to learn about different social issues as well. I recommend reading it as a family .
Good fit, great heel pocket. Haven't had a chance to really break them in but the few runs I have done were great .
i was very happy to connect the deveice to obd2 connectori drove the car on high way like one hour.  The deveice start beeping with green light i was very happy that minitors are ready i disconnect the deviice and hook up my scanner and find out two minitors were still not ready i  went to the aricare station and car rejected this action of this deveice put me in big confusion.  i still have to discuss this matter with the tech support .
Needs a mounting bracket, if not its loose and its shakes when the car is running, Its good though. Thumbs up .
it doesn't come with the plugins for the webcam at the top or the microphone for the laptop. And its the right screen just not with everything I needed .
The phone resets itself and turns off and on independently.There are many reports on such an issue with this phone over the internet.If you buy it here, you will have... NO WARRANTY.Added after a couple of days:a piece of paper attaching the battery to the contacts solved the issue. Yet, it was frightening .
Tina Fey did not dissapoint with this book!! Highly recommended whether you are a fan of Tina Fey or not .
This item would have been returned for a refund, but the amount it cost is not worth the hassle. If my present Modem gives out, I will dig out the USB 56K and try again to install. I sincerely doubt it downloads at 56K. The old saying &#34;you get what you pay for&#34; comes to mind. Hope you have better luck with one if you purchase it .
Great read -Something different and unexpected at every turn.  I couldn't wait to get back to the book to read some more .
I thought  the book was a slow read . It did not hold my interest. It was not a book that I couldn't wait to get back to. I would not recommend this .
It is a pretty awesome game but the server crashes 8 if you leave the game while your character is dead. So don't quit our It'll crash the deviceLol .
everything is good!delivery speed, book condition, price....I wanted to buy this book for a long time, but I couldn't find it in Korea.When I found this book on the Amazon, I was happy.Finally I got this book last week.Thanks to you .
I received this cookbook for Christmas.  Although I am a vegetarian, I do like to substitute vegan meals as much as possible.If you are looking for a cookbook that promotes super health and vitality, pass on this cookbook, it's not what you're looking for.  If you are, however, new to vegan cooking or are looking for some vegan comfort food than this may be the cookbook you're looking for.  This cookbook contains typical American recipes that have been converted to be free of any animal products.  It's a great cookbook for having mixed company over (mixed as in meat eaters and non-meat eaters) and for having some guilt-free American fare.  I think this cookbook is practical and shows non-vegan eaters just how tasty animal-free can be.Her "Chloestess" cupcake recipe is phenomenal.  I made these for New Years Eve and it was actually my first attempt at making cupcakes.  I was so excited about how delicious and easy these cupcakes were.  I didn't have a chance to tell everyone that they were vegan and they were a hit!  I can't wait to make them again .
Before I got this, I was really skeptical about a video game helping me burn calories and work out.  Also, like a lot of people, I have a really busy lifestyle and can't find time to go to the gym, so I thought I would give this a try.  After using it, I fell in love right away.  The exercises are fun and varied.  The cardio kicks my butt - I love it!  I like seeing the amount of calories that I am burning, I find that to be very motivating.I really love that this video game is getting me up and moving .
The watch I like alot....large face easy to read ...wasn't sure about the band when I ordered it but I think it will be ok .
Love the game wish there was a paid version that way wouldn't have to deal with all the pop ups .
I was very disappointed with the book.  I read a few pages and did not like it at all.  It is so far from any of the other books that I read .
I didn't like his book and stopped reading it.  I have an MA in Historical Spirituality and he seemed to just want to give his own ideas.  He says that what Luke in the Gospel says isn't correct but his ideas are .
I enjoyed reading this book because it is written as a 'Spiritual Guidance book&#34;.  He gives very good examples to follow even though it was written so many years ago.  What I did not like was that he added on with answers to and from Sisters in a community.  I would have preferred that he stopped after  his first thoughts. I heard that he is known as a well known writer, and it is hard to find copies of his books .
I deleted it before I finished reading it.  It made no sense that someone could be as stupid as the main character .
His life was one of a prophet which is calling out to us today.  America already has accepted Abortion as legal, children with disabilities are killed before they even have a chance. 1 out of 5 people say they don't believe in God.  I think Pastor Bonhoeffer is telling us to wake up .
I am a Daughter of the Saint Francis de Sales Association, and he always spoke about the present moment.  Jean-Pierre de Caussade continues with this theme.  He helps you to understand that following Gods' plan really isn't hard at all, just do the right thing all the time.  I am very happy to have found this book, and highly recommend it to anyone who wishes to improve their Spiritual life .
I thoroughly enjoyed the book.  I did not care too much for the ending and the letters, but the first part was amazing.  I am a Daughter of St. Francis de Sales and found him very interesting and copyed many of his statements into a journal .
It was very interesting seeing how it was about Russia and the Jesus Prayer.  I liked the idea of a mantra but he would prefer saying the prayer and not talking to others.  Though, from this book I have gotten many other fantastic books .
I truly enjoyed reading this short book.  It is amazing how she helped so many children with a group of the underground to find safety.  It talked about how the parents did not want to part with their children and how she had to convince them it was the best thing.  I don't know if I would have been willing to have my children brought up Jewish if I were a Christian being executed. Also how she is tortured and never told the name of even one person.  Her strength and beliefs were amazing.  That she lived in our time and died at 98 years old is also amazing.  It is simply written .
I am reading it now, but he takes the Hail Holy Queen and speaks about each part of it.  I realize even better now how much Mary wants us to be happy with her Son, how much she cares for each one of us, no matter how bad we have made our lives.  A lot of these and thous but worth it .
I really enjoyed this video, it kept my interest.  I hadn't seen anything by this author before.  I hope there are more like this one .
I did not want to put this book down.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  I have gotten another book by the same author and hope it is as good .
I like use their lotion, it's very soft and not feel oil. sometimes you buy lotion or cream is let you feel uncomfortable, but they don't. and very helpful for your dry skin .
They describe the shampoo is very good for your dry and frz hair. but it doesn't help. and after i clean my hair, my hair feel so frz and dry, even I already use the other brand conditional, ot still frz. And it is baged by two, I don't know how can I use it now .
These gaiters are pretty crappy... I weight 150 with skinny legs and the XL barely fit.. The straps on the bottom don't even line up correctly, they are set to far back making it difficult to secure the straps in the correct position under your boot, if u have big boots don't plan on using these with them, and the shoelace hook is completely worthless .
This tablet is horrible. It is extremely slow and the screen went out after a few days of light use. I DO NOT recommend this product to anyone. I am in the process of returning mine. The screen just blacks out for no reason. It is cheap and poor quality, even for the low price .
I had this flat iron once before [I lost it :( ] and LOVED it. But I guess they changed the design of it and now it just looks and feels.. CHEAP. If they're going to put a certain picture than I SHOULD be getting the product of the picture I see, NOT this cheap version of a good flat iron. I'm really disappointed because I was SO excited to be getting my flat iron back, but now I'm considering returning it .
This book was great! The plot was awesome and each chapter left you wanting more. However, i will warn you that there is a large amount of questionable content as the story goes along. It isn't very easy to just ignore it. I did enjoy the book thoroughly .
I purchased these cases and I was very pleased when they came. They looked exactly as the picture showed them as, but after about a month, they became very dirty and I don't put them on my phone anymore! They are very pretty and I received many compliments on them .
I personally love this game because I can give my horse any name and there are no limits to how many letters it can have. I also enjoy this game because it allows you to pick different horses. My only problem with the horses is that there are not enough breeds or colors. I think ponies should be included and they should have different colors like red or blue roan and zebras. Also there are pop up adds that constantly bug you. My only other problem is that the breeding barn isn't given at the beginning. I love that i get to earn money through the shows and can learn how to manage it .
Kids love the taste of it, but I don't like. I think my children should not eat a lot.  I don't like it .
I bought after reduction. My grandfather and grandmother in taking, but now do not know the effec.They must adhere to a period of time .
No,  I think it's pretty bad,  shoes are relatively large, and uncomfortable.  I bought two pairs of, regret.  Never again purchased .
Had a projection clock prior to this one. (It finally gave out) The magnasonic is much nicer. I will never own anything other than a projection clock .
good color, and seem strong enough. I used once, no water leakage, so, i think it definitely worth that price .
the connection between the watch and the chain is not so wonderful.  it looks fine, although it feels too light. that is it .
I bought the Violin flash drive, it was an awesome peace I'm metal, but the Flash Drive Plastic inside the metal broke, so I threw it away it didn't work for me .
I liked them all except the cheetos didn't seem to really gel with the rest of the products. Good though .
My step son was here for spring break and I ordered these, when he returned in June for the summer, they stopped working after just a couple of days. I can't figure out how to get them returned or exchanged because it's past the 90 days .
As far as I know, this is the only American translation of the Grimm tales that is complete, including several tales that were only in the original German first edition. Though the tales are all here, the only ones translated from the first edition text are those that were subsequently removed- You won't find Rapunzel claiming her clothes don't fit or the shorter version of Hansel and Gretel, so if that's what you were hoping for, this isn't it. Also, the translation doesn't have the archaic feel to it that is commonly used in fairy tales; it's basically been modernized. Aside from those two criticisms, I did enjoy this book, especially the lesser-known tales .
The sound is nice and they are comfortable. They're great, as long as you're not trying to use them for more than 4 hrs. The 3 star rating is due to the short battery life .
I bought This and it stopped working properly a couple months after I bought it. Now it makes a funny noise when it charges my daughter's Nabi, and the car charger stopped working completely! The Nabi site has them for like $7 -$10 without the car chargers that don't work anyway. Very disappointed because I paid so much for such a low quality product.Do not buy this. It is expensive and will break very easily.I would give this  0 stars if I could .
I received my toe ring and it immediately broke in half while putting it on. I thought it felt flimsy but didn't realize that it was compromised. I only paid $1 or so for it, so I guess you get what you pay for .
Just started and this was a good help. Gave me an idea of  what not to do. Picked up a few pointers .
I'm 57 and personally I learned a whole lot of tips that I never knew before that I can easily apply! I thought this was all too complicated, but here it's put simply and you can easily understand the reasons why you should use different products and what they do for your skin and the difference it all makes.Valuable reading and knowledge that I'll use for the rest of my life, well worth the time & money to know this stuff .
Got it on time and was very impressed bow works awesome very powerfully and no issues easy to put together all and all a great crossbow for the money .
Cool game to kill time not bad at all just need to figure out how to get more peanuts with out buying them I won't spend money in the game other than that cool game .
Shot these a few times and lost one of the tips ok for target practice but wouldn't hunt with them .
Dream vs. RealityDreaming just isn't the same anymore after entering the world of "Inception."  Written and directed by Christopher Nolan, this dream like science-fiction thriller becomes a thought provoking film that will excite any dreamer's mind.  It all becomes possible through the Oscar winning performances, direction, and mind bending illusions in production. Chances are you will have to return for a second run through to grasp the reality of this blockbuster.The life of a professional "extractor isn't an easy one, especially for Dominick Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio), whose job with the help of advance technology, is to attack the minds of their sleeping targets to extract valuable information.  Each time Dom invades someone's subconscious it seems to take a piece out of him. As Dom's story unfolds you begin to see the pain that he goes through, from the loss of his wife, to the torment of never seeing his kids again.  DiCaprio plays the role with excellence by showing that internal conflict.  That moment is shown when we repeatedly see his two little kids playing in the grass and then running off-screen, without looking back at him and is put into a context, and we realize what that memory is for him. Alongside DiCaprio comes the wisecracking comic relief from Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Tom Hardy as the specialist in the team as well as Ellen Page who plays the role of the architect who creates the environments in which the dreams take place.At some point you have to wonder what was going through Christopher Nolan's mind when he brought forth the idea of "Inception."  Nolan simply wanted to create a movie that allowed the audience to experience the reality of dreams.  The complexity of the film doesn't really begin until the multi-layered plot comes into play.  The "dream with a dream" idea shows that Nolan still has the creativity that moviegoers want.  Nolan's plan was to have Cobb complete one final job to plant an idea into someone's mind rather than to take it in order to get home to his children. That is the idea of Inception, and was carefully thought out from an award winning director.  From "Batman Begins" to "The Dark Knight", Nolan sets to intrigue the audience with another adventurous film.Many will find the movie confusing due to the multi-layered stories that are interlinked.  The production will have moviegoers will have more than an ordinary attention to the film and initially wanted them to keep guessing to have multiple screenings.  With ten years in the making, "Inception" gave everyone their own realm of dreams and new ideas for creativity.As I replay the movie in my head trying to grasp of what just happened, the producers got what they wanted.  The ending has us wondering over and over if it was dream or reality, and if it only took one screening to figure it out, bravo to you. The aim of the movie was simple, to create a new world inside one that we each have created when we fall asleep .
SORRY DIDNT LIKE COULDNT PLUG IN TV IT WAZ TO QUIET COULDNT HEAR TO WELL THRU IT OUT...OH WELL WAT YOU GOING PLEASE MAKE BETTER PRODUCTS ...ALOHA .
Everything you need and nothing you don't for AR/M4/M16 maintenance. Love the pull through cleaning cable, never liked the typical cleaning rods. This was recommended by a Military friend of mine and I was not disappointed. Would definitely buy again .
I LOVED THIS BOOK. I normally don't read because, I really don't find books that pique my interest. I seen the cover and said "This might be interesting" and so I started reading. After the first chapter I was hooked. I'm currently reading the second and I'm loving it. Looking forward to the next few .
This app works great on my droid incredible, and I got it for free a couple years ago. I just bought it for my Kindle Fire HD, and it doesn't work at all. Waste of money .
I loved it and I hope there's more to come with a story line that's not too rushed like this one .
I have never received my kozier&Erb;'s Fundamentals of Nursing, 8th Edition  study guide l had ordered. Am so disappointed.ThanksJacqueline maranga .
This Yoga mat is great!  I was shopping around for a new mat and the YogaHola mats caught my eye right away! I loved the variety of bright colors to choose from and the price! I decided to order a purple mat and when it came to my door I was not disappointed, I got exactly what I thought I was going to get! My zen room at home has really hard floor so I wanted something sturdy yet soft. I have arthritis so I need something to cushion my joints well. I was a bit skeptical when I saw how thin the mat is but when I used it I was amazed at how comfortable it is. It has really good grip so it so it doesn't slide on my floor.I like to do yoga outside too so the carry chord that came with this mat makes transporting my mat easy breezy. The chord is thin but sturdy so it&#8217;s easy to slip on and off the mat and it&#8217;s not bulky or annoying. After yoga in the grass/dirt, this mat is super easy to clean. Just a quick hose down and you&#8217;re good to go.I recommend this yoga mat to anyone who needs one. I absolutely love mine!Namaste .
I would recommend this product, I use it in smoothies.  One scoop is 30 grams of protein, so one can adjust accordingly if you don't want that much .
The case is super great and complete fit with my Samsung tablet. The context of the case is anti-fingerprint, so it's always clean and tidy. I like the thing that I can lay my tablet on the desk in a decent slope, in a position that I could take notes in a comfortable posture, i.e., you do not need to lower your head too much .
I own several Camuto Hartys and love every one of them. I believe they run true to size with an array of colors to choose from, which by the way showed true in person from what I saw on my monitor.  The dark wood was difficult to find in my size (6.5) so I didn't mind paying more for them. The leather is very soft and for a pointy pump, they are comfortable and can be dressed up or down. I highly recommend them .
Love these shoes.. very very light .. i wear them to the gym  without socks.  I look sooo good all the women look at me and say Are you Brad Pitt...  And I say no im just wearing  Chuckit sneakers .
Not what I ordered, does not do what I needed, it was not the express addition of greeting card factory .
To small and won't stay straight it keeps folding back up. Cat does play in it because he does not fit in it. Again it is to small .
I love Dog and Beth have since they were on A&E but it seems like now Beths attitude has gotten much meaner it could just be a wrong vibe Im getting maybe she is just tougher but it seems with whomever she deals with she just has an attitude about everything. Then she made that lady cry thats not cool. I understand you are trying to help these other bail agents but these are not your "fugitives" they are other bail agents and you are treating them like crap on your boot heel because you seem to feel they are beneath you in some way? Like I said I could be wrong but I just feel like her attitude has gotten rude and disrespectful and it seems to play apart on everybody else's attitude as well. Its not like before they would be laughing and joking but now it is just smug, tight faces and get the job done and were done. I don't know if TV has went to your head but if it has its time for a reality check. Love the show but if it is going to be this way in all the episodes then it is not worth watching .
I treated this book five stars because I like animals and I loved this book and can't wait to read waggit again and waggit forever .
Don't waste your money on other brushs. This one gets down to the undercoat as well as tye top coat and works great .
Exactly what I wanted and was expecting. It's a great size- not too big and not too small. Works well with a Rodeoh harness .
My husband and I liked the gun socks fairly well...The only problem we had was that you can't leave all the accessories (scope, etc.) on your gun when putting them in the sock .
I don't always take my kindle places so the kindle app for my phone has been great!  I can read anywhere and I don't seem to have any problems so far...Keeping my fingers crossed now that I said that .
I bought two of these for my daughters for Christmas to go with their bows and I wish I had gotten something different.  They are extremely flimsy and swing around alot.  Good for target practice in the yard but not really taking out .
For a non-fiction book this was an awsome book.  I know that there were parts taken from different people's stories but it just seems so real.  I couldn't put it down... Great book .
I had this on my phone...always freezing up and force closing...It seemed like nothing but problems for me so I had to delete it .
My husband and I purchased this saw to cut a limb that was leaning toward our house.  We have had high winds lately and a tornado in 2011.  So for safety of our children the limb need down.  We had no problem getting the saw in the tree.  Where we ran into trouble was keeping the saw going.  You could only use very short strokes and it kept getting stuck.  We sawed for abut a hour and a half before we decided to wench the limb down.  Don't know if I would use this again, but at least it is more safe than climbing the tree .
Read this in the local library, but it became no longer available,very well written and researched, love the original quotes embedded in the text .
good story line, couldn't put it down, interesting characters..fabulous author...can not wait for more of her books.fantastic well framed murder mystery .
the aussies were sold out by their own government and military brass, short on weapons etc. but not intestinal fortitude .
too technical, too verbose ..not an expose of those who flew and what they were subject to inthe combat arena .
I love the smell of patchouli. This was NOT patchouli. I am a huge fan of nearly all Auric Blends scents and this was awful. I strongly believe this particular bottle was very old. It was very, very yellow upon coming out of the bottle. It smelled absolutely like a bottle of vitamins. Very, very disappointed. I have owned this product (purchased from elsewhere) before and I know for a fact it smells tons better than what I got from this seller .
This was a gift. Im still working out the best was to use this for optimum pleasure as I have not yet grown used to using my magic wand. This item has a good feel. Silky and firm, but not too firm or rigid. In comparison to a couple of other wand attachments I have tried this one is much better .
These were well made and shipping was quick. I'm very happy with these. They are beautiful and I can't wait to wear them! Will probably purchase in more colors at a later time .
These bowls are very small. One had a small dent in it when I removed it from the box but I was able to pop it back and you can't tell. Plastic is more on the softer side. For what we plan on using it for, I don't really have any complaints. Just wish I had gotten a size bigger .
My boyfriend got this for me. It smells amazing! Its light enough to be used on my face and I have oily skin. I like that it isn't heavy or sticky, and it soaks in fast, yet still hydrates skin. My skin is soft and smells wonderful. Very happy .
So impressed by these. They smell exactly like their names. Turned Earth Cedar smells as such. But its wonderful! It takes you on a journey simply by smelling it. The patchouli is my personal favorite. There are six glass vials per box ( two of each scent) and are so worth the price. Buy these. You won't regret it .
I love this. Fit is perfect. Doesn't have a lot of give in the fabric, so don't expect it to stretch much when considering what size to order. Not too short ( not skimpy ). Received it quickly and love it! No complaints .
This top is made for bustier women. It fit me fine everywhere except for the chest area. Just wasn't  meant for my body type .
Upon being emailed to leave a review, HERE IT IS, EPARE. The frother works fine, dispite you emailing me and asking me to remove a two star review that I never left. So instead of removing my &#34;phantom review&#34; I just left this one...for the first time. Thanks for the frother. Could have done without the weird email, though .
I've had this case for a few months now. When I first got it,I loved it - it stuck onto my phone perfectly and looks great. But now the front part of the case for the front of my cell phone doesn't stay stuck onto the phone. It's constantly falling off when I pick up the phone, open the phone, etc. It is really annoying and a burden. I would not reccomend this cell phone case to anyone .
Could not find this book anywhere but on Amazon gave mine to a friend in marital situation, never had a chance to finish reading it myself. Very glad to own a copy again .
I bought these for a xmas gift. The color is red red. Not faded or orangy.  I know these will fit and who doesn't like to stand out In a crowd.... im lov'n these little shoes.  They are not for long distant walking and not running, but cute to add to any girls stylish self .
Its a great color. But it doesn't have speed controll. I read the reviews before purchasing.  Its not bad just be careful when using to not spill. Be creative, it woks fine but could be stronger, it does boag down, just lift and keep gling .
Blught this for my daughter for next year.  I saw someone this year and she carried the look to the t.  Flashy color and looks fun. The head band is too small. Not like the picture shows, I will have to make my own. Itdoes run a little small I would order larger, but for now this works .
Great color and will do the job when im watching my kids baseball games in the rain. Its a must have that you don't think about till you need it and dont have it.  So meny colors to choose from. Its a little pricy but iv sat in the rain to many times to count, I will be high and dry now .
The color is spot on...deep purple...I didn't want to spend to much and these fit my budget. The fit is good and im very happy with the look and feel .
Bought for my son. He uses these with a  baseball bat, not really designed for that, but they do fly.  Our dog chases them.  We don't golf but I thought these oversized birdies were cool .
I absolutely love tnese sandals. I have small feet so they fit me perfectly.  I was worried because some reviews said they were tight or the half sizes were to small. Mine fit great. They are very light weight.  Fabulous color purple.  I think its like everything eles you don't know what your missing till you have a pair of these, you will want more, one in each color to gl with your summer outfits.  Love love these .
The color is perfect...its purple as discribed...not pink.  Very fast service. Im in love with these little flowers. Thank you .
Great light weight jacket.  Very warm.  I love the bottom zipper, makes it easier to sit down.  The color is a la la purple which I love.  The light weight makes such a difference than a heavy jacket. Not giving anything up with the omni heat.  Yes I would recommend to everyone .
I really never listened to any of Seal's music but when I heard a few of the old school songs that he re-made, I thought WOW he really did this CD justice!  New School vs Old School....can't wait for the next one .
There are children that write better than this. i'm sorry, but this was a stilted, terrible book. no development, no real story. an hour of my life wasted. thanks .
Second time around was not as good, but still amazing. I loved this book a lot. Certainly a good read .
Very sad.Arrived todayThe cap is looseNo shrink seal.Came openPaid almost 25 bucksI want my money back .
They should send it today or tomorrow.  I tried to send them a email but it failed. How to run the business without the email system.I'm a little disappointment.Hopefully my product expiration date won't expire :(((((Sad sadI gotta go travel soon. Was hoping it would arrived before then .
Didn't peel at all. No burining no redness. Just very light peel for meI tried it 3 times. Once a week cuz no peeling so I add more layer n stay longer each week. :( disappointed .
yeah it looks pretty cool,but i don't know,  i bought it for my girlfriend.Hope she'll like it anyway  thank u .
I haven't been playing the harmonica for a long time at all, and I'm just learning to play. But it doens't take and expert to realize this thing is GARBAGE!!!! It sounds like crap!!! I should of listened to the review that said &#34;ordered one day, in the garbage the next&#34;. Don't waste your money on this, even if it is for little kids. I've got a little 4 dollar harmonica from SEARS, that sounds better than this .
I got this for my little brother, and its freaking awesome! It even has all these small little saying on the sides the pictures don't show! It is a tad small and could come off as a suprise like it was to me, BUT... they do list the measurments on the page, so I need to learn to read more carefully! My brother thought this penny bank was hilarious, and loves it .
When I ordered this I paid for overnight shipping so I could recieve it saturday, I didn't recieve it until monday, but amazon was very helpful and quick to refund my shipping fee's so it's all good! I bought this ukulele as a begginer uke, all my friends have a makala, in concert and in tenor. For you that don't know a soprano is the smallest and one of the hardest to play because of it's size, which I didn't know until after I ordered but still I'm not complaining. I did not recieve the Makala that is showed in the picture. I recieved a Kala instead but the price is around the same, and so is the quality. My Kala cam with aquila strings on it as well so I didn't even have to re-string it. After finally getting it tuned, it sounds amazing, better than I even thought it would. I just pulled it out of the box yesterday and already have a few songs I can play. Besides the shipping getting screwed up and getting another brand ukulele, I'm very happy just having a ukulele that plays well, and looks great in my hands .
This is a decent bag, my ukulele fits in it well and doesn't seem to slide around much. It keeps it dry. I just wish there was a bigger space for my to keep my snark tuner, I have to put it inside the back under the neck of the uke to fit .
The shipping was kinda crappy I couldn't really track my package at all, It only had one update on where it was. That's really my only complaint. The lighter itself was pretty awesome! It's a high quality zippo, the marine emblem is amazing! it looks like the stay brights you'd wear on the uniform, it's not printed on the zippo itself. I bought this as a christmas and they absolutely loved it! Great buy .
I just started to play the uke, it's an insturment that has always caught my eye. I orded the makala MK-S and when it was delievered to my house I recieved the Kala KA-15s instead. I'm not complaining!! After doing my research I realized I had recieved a better quility Uke! I also ordered new Aquila strings, but this kala is already strung with them. Right out of the box this uke is beautiful! After first tuning it, the sound is great and louder than I expected. After I let it sit for a while and pick it back up I just have to adjust the strings a tiny bit and its back in tune, it doesn't loose its tune to bad, so you can tell the tuning machines are good quility as well. This ukulele is a great instrument and a very good buy! I just wish I didn't have to work so I could play it longer!! To bad I don't get payed to play music .
When I buy something, it doesn't matter what it is, I always want something diffrent from what you'd normaly see..... This ukulele is it! It's gorgeous! If I knew how to add pictures I would. It has a really nice sound to it as well, and seems to project it very well. I did overnight shipping and got it on schedual. The company who shipped it to me really did an amazing job protecting the ukulele on it's travel. It was packed in a huge box, inside atleast 3 other boxes surrounded by foam and bubble wrap. As of right now I don't have anything bad to say about the ukulele. The picture shown above shows just regular dots on the fret board, the actually fret board has really nice plus sign + inlays. The tuners aren't to bad either they seem to hold a tune fairly well but I guess we'll see after a few weeks of constant tunning.The only thing I think I don't like is I think the action is a little high so I might have to fix that when I add my Low G strings. Over all this ukulele is beautiful and I'm so glad I bought this, I'm not disappointed at all .
I've had this decal on my car for a year now. It's still there with no ware on it what so ever. It's not a box type sticker either, its the actual cut out of the letters which I love. All in all its a great decal with a simple statement so all the local haji know who you are .
I ordered this Hat, Friday December 13th, and recieved it Monday, December 16. It got to my house a day before the estimated delievery date which his always a plus! Just as the other reviews said, It's a tight fitting hat so if you have a huge head, it might not cover your ears. Its really soft and really warm. I like how it shapes around my head, and doesn't have the &#34;horns&#34; from the stitching, I think this is definitly worth the money .
When I first bought this, I was unsure how I'd actually like it. I tried wearing it with no weapon and it felt really uncomfortable, and awkward. After I placed my M&P40; full size in it, it fit like a glove. The weapon fits nice and snug in the holster and I'm not worried about it falling out. When I draw the weapon the holster stays nice and snug on my belt and barely moves with the draw. Before buying this holster I was kinda drawn away about the reviews saying the thumb saftey disengages when holstered, but I found that not to be true. My thumb saftey stays in the safe postion just fine, so they must of fixed that little bug. All in all this is a really nice holster for the price and I would highly recommend it for anyone wishing to carry the full size M&P.;Also the belt clip isn't that bad either as I also read in other reviews, It's a little bulky but does the job. I'm definitly going to invest in the M&P; shield to reduce imprinting from carring a full sized pistol as a CCW.Buy this holster you wont be disapointed .
Although I didn't buy this tuner off of amazon, which I should have it's cheaper here. This tunner is awesome! I use it for my acoustic guitar and my Uke and it is perfect .
I was shipped to my house pretty quick, and I gave it to my mother for her birthday, She loved it! The only thing I didn't really like about it, is the heart was a little bigger than I thought It'd be. But all in all it put a smile on my mom's face and thats all that matters .
So my biggest worry was that I was gonna shout out this kinda money and the glasses would be fake.... I still don't know if they are real or not but they seem pretty legit. The material is really durable the RB4151 is a match from the raybans website and it has the rayban logo on the lens. Also on the left lens the letters RB are actually engraved onto the lense. They fit really well and I love the style of them. They do the job they're expected to do expecially with all this beautiful weather comming to Ohio .
I ended up buying this at wal-mart like an idiot, instead of looking on amazon first. So I ended up paying the full 40 bucks for it. I attached this light to my full size M&P40; and it fits great. It doesn't have a lot of over hang in front of the weapon either. I fired about 150 rounds with the light attached and it seemed to hold up to the recoil just fine. When I fired with the light on, It didn't flicker or anything. For 190 lumes the light was brighter than expected and the stobe is pretty awesome too, It will light up my entire front room in pitch black and blind anything you point it at. They can't see you but you see them just fine!If you're a tactical junkie like myself, I think the only down fall to this light is if you wanna holster it with the light attached. Galco makes a universal holster which will be combatable with this light, but I like my Kydex holsters. If you want a Kydex holster that will accept this light all I've been able to find so far is places where I have to ship my light to and have my holster custom made. Still though this light is better than expected, Great buy .
So, I bought this thing new years eve, while I was praticapating in adult activities, and I may or may not have bought this. Needless to say it sits in a junk draw at my house, but I'm sure it works great .
I bought this light and I ended up buying a iprotec instead. I tried to cancel the order but it was to late. This tac light isn't horible, I just prefer the iprotec over it. The power button is in an awkward position on the bottom of the light, and it only has one light function. The diffrent colored lens it came with I think are pretty lame, I don't know about other people but I have this light for home defense only and I rather blind who ever I'm aiming at. I do like the quick release fuction it has It makes it very quick and easy to mount and unmount the light to your pistol. I have a Full size M&P40 it fits on I just wish I could place it on the far notch on the rail. When the light goes on its pretty sturdy to will not a lot of play. All in all its not a bad tac light if youre trying to be cheap about it .
I recieved this speaker for free from verizon when I signed my contract with them, and was a little hesitant about it. I was woundering the quility since they just gave it away... Setting up the bluetooth connection was really simple, I barely had to do anything, and when I leave and come right back it automaticly connects to it. The sound is pretty great!! Its nice and loud, and doesn't sound destorted. Its really nice that you can sync two of these up with each other and have left and right speakers. Over all this speaker is pretty bad a**!! Buy it .
They are really good quality, they feel heavy in your hand and look pretty nice as well. Besides UPS being lame and not getting my package to me on time, I am very happy with my order .
I ordered this for my brother as a little side gift, and I was really displeased with it. First off when it was shipped the box looks like the sellers, or the shippers played soccer with it, The box had a lot of damage. When I opened the box I found the head broken off. When you look at the ashtray, it just looks poor quility, the paint job sucks, the molding sucks. Just do yourself a favor and not buy this .
This is a good durable hat! I've owned this one for over a year now and wear it daily, The velcro is placed in good straight spots and the flag that comes with it is very durable as well! The hat is very comfortable and isn't to flimsy if you're worried about that. I will probably end up buying another one, Coyote tan tends to show sweat stains pretty well. Buy this item .
I have a Oscar Schmidt OU7 Concert Uke and It fits in the bag perfect. The case hugs my ukulele and there's no room for it to move anywhere. The case has a nice thick pad all the way around, which makes me feel comforable if, it were to bumb into something. I'm very happy with this purchace .
The delivery was very quick, I ordered it Wednesday morning and recieved it thursday. I'm pretty happy about thatII was very hessitant to buy this light after reading all the reviews, but I took a chance.... I mean it's only 8 bucks. I put a set of brand new batterys in and the light turned on just fine. When the sun went down, I went outside to play around for a bit. My friend's I do security with all have this same flashlight and have had them for a little over a year now. I don't feel mine is as bright at theirs, but this light is still bright. I love how it can zoom in and out that really helps when we are looking for gate jumpers at our music festivals. The light is really solid, It has the High, Medium, and low settings along with strobe and SOS. The slide to zoom in and out is pretty tight, but I'm sure it will ease with use. There is no way this light is 1600 lumes, but it's still a good buy, I'm happy with the results. Hopefully if you buy this light you get the same results as me or better .
This is a pretty cool flag, but be sure to read the details unlike me. I thought the flag was bigger until after I had already bought it and it was in the process of shipping to my house. I'm not completly upset though, for the size of this flag it is pretty durable. Not bad quaility at all .
It was shipped to my house really quick, It has a heavy feel to it, doesn't feel cheap. My sister loved the necklace .
This works great with the Samsung Tablet 10.1. I use it a lot because I don't like to use my fingers on the tablet .
I sent this back because the stone was cloudy and the ring itself was flimsy. There is no point in wearing a ring that isn't noticeable .
The device works perfectly to download from the computer to the Kindle. Isn't that what it is designed to do .
Love this case. It works great for reading with the slot to make it stand up; it is attractive; it closes with the magnet. Couldn't have found a better one .
Anyone dreaming of a solo voyage anywhere should read this. The first solo round the world, in a time when small boats didn't go too far .
This is a week ago by a good idea to make a good uses this is a good tying this is not about post on this page is the best of this year ago and the best of this is the world to do so that you can also find that you have a food and drug use a half years and the best of a good tune use you. it for a week or two weeks for. It's.  Amazing .
Turned an old Garmin into a new GPS.  Meets my needs and has had no glitches.  Now i have a back up GPS i can trust .
have not even had a year and the slats are breaking and falling out not a good product needs to be better .
Love this. The instructions to apply were very clear and there aren't any bubbles! I would tell anyone about this product .
Exelente producto es exactamente como se mueatra en la foto uno de los mejores relojes que e comprado h h h .
Bushnell Powerview 8 x 21 is very compact and useful. It's worth the value, i have never had a Binocular like this one .
Feels like you are in Russia  , Interesting story with characters that are believable, to bad he did not write a follow up .
This seat is a good seat. It looks good and everything but about a month after I got it the seat had already broke on me. One of the bottem screws had popped off leaving the seat sticking up. the screw can be replaced so its not as bad but I'm hoping it doesn't happen again .
I chose this product as I believed DC/Warner would have selected a top quality towel on which  to place their Batman logo.  I washed it before giving it to my grandson.  Twelve inches on the side of the bath towel totally unravelled and now is a bunch of threads and body edge of the towel is fringe!  I am so upset about this as I bought my other grandson a Superman towel and granddaughter a Hello Kitty towel and had no problems with those towels.  Now I have to figure out how to get a better quality towel at more expense. Command Brand decorative hooks now sell Hello Kitty, Batman and Superman hooks and I was excited to get all  the towels purchased for the kids' bathroom.  To have this towel ruin this project has been very discouraging indeed. How doI even get my money back on this purchase .
They are so comfortable and I have not taken them off since I put them on.  Can wear them with just about anything.  I would recommended them to anyone .
This book seemed a bit rushed and at times things would be said or happen that I was not ready for. But I am going to be a good reader and just go along with it and I am sure it will be addressed in the next book. I really feel invested in these characters even though the books are so short. But I know the story is good because I want more. Also I know the story is good because I really do feel sad and disappointed with some of the characters, well one in particular. But that is what the story is calling for and by good it delivers. There better be some shaping up from both characters and some lines drawn in the sand or I will do it myself! This did not have as much sexy times as the last book but it was more about the relationship. Which I enjoyed .
I felt like I was experiencing her life as I read this book. I was sucked fright in to it and stayed up all night as I couldn't put it down. I laughed and I cried. I was angry. And disillusioned for her. Sara and Evan sticking with her and not saying anything was so moving and yet I was a little mad that they didn't try to turn it in as it is a heavy burden to have to go through. I loved it and immediately ordered the other two books as so as I finished the first one. Which is this one. Great job  Ms. Donovan .
I found the twist of Jonathon and Alex not getting back together kind of regressing. Surprised by Alex's anger and behaviour both realistic, yet vengeful. Jonathon was better off without her toxic attitude .
I feel like I am Emma. I cried, I laughed, I was awe struck. I didn't think that this would be as great as the first book. I was so wrong. It seems like Me. Donovan is writing an autobiography about her childhood. I couldn't put it down. I wanted to love and protect Emma from any more pain and suffering. Great read .
They are super cute, but blue one was messed up. So not all of them are pre-inspected for quality. If you are a fan of bows you will like these .
I like it, but isn't as nice as I thought it would be. I would have to see another waterproof case before I bought another one .
It is a fun game. You got to guess some restaurants that you have never heard of before is the only downside to this game. If you live on the Westcoast and the places are only on the Eastcoast, all you can do is guess. Also it is the same for people from the Eastcoast and the restaurant is only on the Westcoast .
bought the case and everyone complained that it echoed when they talked.  Called Lifeproof and the serial number didn't match anything they have made.  They informed me that the product was a replica .
I did not travel jet with it, but it looks great! Love the color and the material. The 8 wheels seems to work very nice and is very smooth to maneuver. I also bought the matching tote bag. I can't wait to travel with both next August .
I have had more diving and tactical application watches than most, yet this model really excites me. Compared to the original 3000 series Quartz Luminox, it is a huge step in both quality and function. I used my 3000 series throught a military career and later in the private sector, and it saw great abuse without failure. I can only imagine this more robust design, should be a comfort while getting in some bottom time. So far, time keeping is on par with my higher end watches, just remember, autos have greater variations in accuracy. Nicely sized, with a bezel which should be easy enough to use with gloved hands. The Tritium does not seem as bright as others, but is still always visible. If you desire a watch to get you noticed, I would suggest something else, or even the limited Sea Wolves model, simply because, despite the large size, this is a very low-key watch. I was going to pick up another Tag, Breitling, or Swiss Military 10km model, but I am glad I saved the money and made this purchase. Amazon offers this Swiss Automatic, for the price of an Asian mass produced timepiece .
This book tells the tale, of the knife, and even the history of owners of this extraordinary blade. If you are serious about your Sabertooth, you will enjoy this book, covering everything imaginable about the knife. I actually purchased it twice, on the same iPad. It did not lay out well in Nook, however, the Kindle version was perfect. It is not often, that we have a book for collectible knives, which are authored by the man who deigned the knife .
Arrived fresh, potent and within a short time. Great alternative to other energy source and without other additives you may not desire .
I'm a teacher becoming a Leader in Educational Organizations and this book will drive you and gave you ideas about how to mantain a positive environment and how to become a strategic no matter what institution you are leading .
Because this is my first record player, I can not go into the audio specifications or other things that audiophiles and novice Turntable collectors can. What I can tell you is this turntable is aesthetically pleasing and will play your records- nothing more, nothing less.I bought it on impulse. The unique suitcase look attracted me to it, and it looks great in my apartment. Like others have said, the speakers are okay. I am content with them for now because the speakers are loud enough for my tiny apartment, but if you are wanting to play it in a bigger place or for a party, you would probably want to buy some decent speakers.The reason I am not giving this product five stars is because this turntable does have a tendency to skip songs if the bass is too much. I realized that last night when &#34;Limit To Your Love&#34; by James Blake was playing. Towards the middle of the song, when the bass amped up, the record began to skip. I tried to fix this by placing a nickle on the needle, but the vibrations from the needle would knock off the nickle! I'm hoping there's another way to &#34;fix&#34; this problem. If anyone has any suggestions, please let me know.Overall this is a great product and I am happy with my purchase .
The t-shirt finally came after waiting much longer than I expected for it. But other than the exceptionally long shipping time the t-shirt was not black as the picture indicated but rather royal blue. Which is not a problem just not what is advertised. Also the logo is a lot smaller than on the picture shown, also not to the point where it is a problem but it would be nice to see what exactly I am paying for before it arrives .
I have always been ambivalent about cupcakes. Who cares right?  Well this book changed everything.  From the first page, it is informative and hilarious.  The recipe's are amazing and not a chemical in sight.  I encourage everyone to buy this book.  If you love baking then this is a game changer.  They talk you through each step, hold your hand and make it ok to make mistakes.  These cakes are mind blowing from the base all the way up to the icing on the top. If you are really stuck or don't understand something, send them a message via Facebook or twitter, that's how involved they are.  Unlike most &#34;celebrity&#34; chefs, they are normal and accessible, and like all of us they work for a living.  A friend and I love it so much we have dedicated and entire blog to making each one.  www.sleazybakeshop.blogspot.nl. Shenanigans and cupcakes.  What's not to love.  I recommend this to everyone .
Looking for an action packed, fast-paced read with vivid imagery? Dashner's "Maze Runner Trilogy" might be what you're looking for. It has great allegorical qualities that not only ask questions about an apocalypse, but also seems to question purpose and maybe even a look at the author's views on creation. Fans of "The Hunger Games" will enjoy .
not what I expected, but it's still a great cd. it has some old tunes and new tunes, still a blessing! enjoy .
Just what I wanted  It looked real, I didn't want  rat hair or dead skins from something that was alive hanging off my belt .
This did not come with 2 balls, making it a pointless buy seeing as how ping pong balls are too big for it. Had the ability to be a good purchase but was let down .
I would recommend this product to anyone with fine hair as mine.  My hair has always been sensitive to hair coloring.  After few treatments my hair would start thinning and have a brittleness to it.  As I've gotten older my hair has been even mor sensitive and i had continued to see thinning.  I have tried other semi-color treatments and even semi-color treatment were too strong for my hair.  I finally discovered the Henna color by Surya at my health food and vitamin store and thought I'd try it.  It's been wonderful for my hair!  Not only is it a natural dye but it is a conditioner as well.  I can always depend on my hair having good volume after each treatment due to the conditioning affect.  I use the black cream and as a full disclosure one should not expect your hair to be a true black from this product.  For my hair it comes out to a beautiful rich brown color which I really like (not a fan of black, black hair anway).  I also get an added bonus because the greys in my hair actually turn a reddish color which makes my hair appear as though I have highlights.  I have gotten so many compliments on the color of my hair, i.e. &#34;your highlights are beautiful&#34;.  Some days I explain that it really isn't highlights but the Henna color that I use that has the affect and some days I just say &#34;why thank you!&#34; and don't bother to explain.  In a nutshell this product is great and I do no see the breakage that I had before as it is very gentle and the coverage is very good; comparable to any semi-color that I have ever used .
A classic science fiction film in all respects. I am always stunned and disturbed when modern film critics/enthusiasts fail to list this film in their top 10 lists. I think I'd put it in my top 5, but if not top 5, at least top 10. The style seems a bit dated to 21st century eyes, but really now, who honestly expects a film made in the 50's to look like a film made in the last 10 years. The extras included are nice, including a complete second feature film &#34;The Invisible Boy&#34;, and several extras from the original. The story is first-rate (man's difficulty with very advanced technology), and the acting and effects are good enough to bring it off well .
It doesn't get any better than this. Alun Armstrong, James Bolam, Dennis Waterman, and Amanda Redman are all superb. The writing is brilliant as well, and NT lets even the minor players shine as each episode weaves a complex story that is so compelling that you will want to watch the entire season in a single sitting. I did, and enjoyed it immensely! Thanks to the BBC too, for showing us a wide range of stories, and little, if any,  gratuitous violence. While the good guys don't always win, they do always do their best to figure things out; and always entertain us along the way. DVD extras are virtually non-existent, but the show is strong enough for me not to care. If I could only keep one tv show on DVD it would be all nine seasons of New Tricks .
This CD is as bad as all the other one star reviews indicate. I'd give it negative 100 stars, but that isn't allowed. What pains me the most about it is it's seemingly complete insincerity. We all know Bob Dylan never was a great singer, and now is worse than ever, but that is less painful than what is delivered here. Bob delivers his singing (not too good), along with children's choirs, and arrangements that came straight from my dentist's office. If Bob and/or his producer/s thought that was a good idea, they should have thought some more. A straight production in any of Bob's many styles would have been much better. (Take your pick, straight acoustic, with the Band, Nashville Skyline, etc ...) This mix of Muzak, Christmas, and Dylan makes The Chipmunks Christmas album sound quite appealing, and makes me doubt Dylan's sincerity. This CD sounds like a recording done only to fulfill a contractual obligation, nothing more. I bought this at a library sale for one cent, and it only reaches that value as amusement. I could go on, but pain isn't worth it .
Got the movie for the niece and she can't put it down . She is a big Katy Perry fan .
I really like the overall appearance of the bar stool.  The suede seat is stylish and the cushion is a nice size but too firm.  The craftsmanship on the backrest isn't too shabby but don't look too close or you may be disappointed.  I didn't realize the legs required to be attached.  I thought the base would be one solid piece so I hope they are durable and can handle adult weight .
This is definitely a winner! I'm a size 8-10. I was looking for a comfy fit & not snug & fitted so &#34;large&#34; was the perfect size especially because the satin bra is adjustable.The back is also the perfect length to feel naughty.The overall feel of the lace and sheer material isn't itchy &  Looks amazing! Can't wait to hear my husband's review. Something tells me, he won't have any complaints!! Very happy w/purchase .
pretty & durable.  nice size for beverages. They weren't as rigid as I expected but worth the money spent.  Didn't have any problems with cracks or any breakage during event .
The i&#60;Device&#62; cord didn't work for me, for whatever reason.I was really worried I fell into a scam (but believe me, the headphones are great).Would easily be 5 stars otherwise. Probably just a small mistake by someone. Hopefully .
What a great story! I was really drawn into the story. It held my interest and I never got bored. I will reread this again and again! Cannot wait to find more stories by Kindle Alexander .
You have to methodically build up your clientelle-creating more wealthy clientelle as you go. I don't mind that the game is slower than others. It gets my brain thinking on building wealth. Its kind of fun really. But I wish it gave more gold as options instead of always trying to tempt you to &#34;buy&#34; gold. Good game for those who want to buy property and collect rent for enjoyment .
The loop with the game happened to me too. Closed it and restarted device. Then never were able to launch the game back. This is a joke .
I feel that the book I ordered and received is acceptable and for the price it is quite satisfactory. I have not been disappointed. Thank you for your attention to this.Robin Yale .
I love this book, however, the binding is worn enough that the pages are falling out loose. It is okay if I am careful in using it. The book has some water damage to it, so I suspect the book binding has absorbed some water to it and so has caused the pages to become loose. It doesn't look bad tho.  thank you .
This book was a gift for my son for Christmas, and I think he has enjoyed it a lot. He does not really believe in this, but finds the book entertaining and fun and this is what counts. Thank you .
This book was also a gift, so I cannot really give you a rating on it. I think it has been enjoyed! Thank you .
This book is in excellent shape and is very informative, for all of the types of inflammatory bowel disease. I can use some of the recipes in this book, but not all as I do not eat meat and almost never eat any legumes as they don't do well for me. So overall this book may not be as helpful to me as to someone else, but it is a good book. Thank you .
Thoroughly enjoyed it! Found difficult to put down. Kept me up many a night just because found it hard not to read one more chapter. The characters came to life and you felt you knew them as if they were real. You do not have to be a Marine to appreciate this timeless story of honor and bravery. A classic sci if - military thriller .
I raved about the previous book in this series and this book did nothing to disappoint. Was totally immersed in the story .
Just finished the third book in this serious and immediately purchased book 4. Have not enjoyed a series such as these in years .
After reading the first book in this series, I purchased the 2nd installment with excitement but also with some reservations that it would be difficult to top the first book. My worry was for naught , this is truly a great read and an outstanding series. The story and characters come to vivid rich life. A book that will keep you up many a night and leave thou craving more. Cannot wait for book 3 .
Almost gave up on this book and in fact found myself just skipping and briefly glancing at pages for the first half of the book. Talk about slow!!! Some might call it character development but this was done to a boring extreme. Am surprised we didn't have a chapter about each individuals dental work. Thank goodness the second half of the book was a bit more enjoyable and made me feel more comfy in  purchasing this book .
Found myself, half way through, just trying to finish it. Not really worth reading unless have some time to waste .
A must read! The characters and story came too life so richly and captivating that it just gripped you by the throat and would not allow you to put down .
I have read every book in this series and I can honesty say I have never been disappointed. In fact ,with each book building on the previous so well, all the characters are so familiar and developed in such depth, their you feel you know each and every one as if they were real . This book, as all the earlier ones, is just simply an exciting , enjoyable ride. Semper Fi .
I have read every single book in this series and each new one stuns me with  how thoroughly enjoyable a read it is. Do yourself a favor, find the first book in this series, purchase and enjoy it and all the following books.Enjoy the ride, you will never want to get off .
It broke the first time my husband dropped it ! It was  not made strong enough to be a cover  for an IPhone . It broke too easily .
Have not memorized the contents, but it appears to be a good resource for understanding Contracts.The step by step explanations are very helpful .
I have a history of bulging discs, with recurrent back pain. I found just a few minutes 1-2 times a day and significantly reduced the back pain, which I attribute to the inversion therapy.It was a big heavy package, but slow and steady assembly allowed me to assembly the table all by myself. Moving the table, after assembly will require some assistance. It is a heavy base, which appears to provide the stability for inversion.It does require a space of its own, at least 6' x 3'. So you can plan accordingly.I especially like the long arm to adjust the ankle lock. I like the ankle rest as well. The are easily adjusted for use. The lumbar support is nice to have, but I'm not sure that it really does anything especially when you are inverted.I would strongly recommend this product .
These boots are great. No discomfort from day one. Everything I wanted too. I highly recommend them to anyone. A .
Nancy Cavin Pitts told her mother's story beautifully in WHEN YOU COME HOME.  Daphne and I were close friends and the sister I never had.  Several times we sat side by side on her sofa while she opened that black scrapbook and shared stories about Raymond.  She was a second-time widow when we met, and often talked about Marvin as well.  He was the father of her four children...a good man; a hard worker.  But theirs was a settled, grown-up kind of love.  Without her ever saying so, I knew Raymond's claim on her heart was permanent.  I felt it when she turned those pages. I heard it when she said his name.  I saw it each Memorial Day at church when she furnished a red-white & blue flower arrangement to grace the piano.  She was still thinking of her soldier.  Nancy allows us to know the young, sometimes giddy Daphne.  Her careful research enables younger women to experience the very different culture of the 40's before television, cell phones, email and Facebook.  It's good for us to know about a time when parents enjoyed respect and good reputations were desired.  Wedding nights celebrated finally the right "to have and to hold from this day forward".  Without a blitz of technology, the radio and daily newspaper quietly informed the family.  Letters were read over and over; not deleted.  Daphne's family loved her through her sadness.  The Lord strengthened her and made her a role-model, not only for her peers but all of us.  She was a lady in every sense of the word.  Her story will inspire our children and grandchildren.  We NEED  to cry for the men and women who gave their lives for our country.  I think this book will be around a long, long time .
This is a high quality MB and nests my core i5-3570K. Although i have not yet used SATA III yet, everything else about this product has been as reviewed by other consumers, and as mentioned by sellers and ASUS themselves .
Although this is not the best Graphics Card out to date, i find it hard to complain about. I feel that it does a good job with gaming and HD videos, I am looking forward to running Adobe CS6 (mainly Ai, Ps, Dw) in the near future .
If this mouse mat is the right size for your desk/mouse then i would recommend it. It is quite firm and allows my Corsair M60 mouse to glide very smoothly. The texture of the mat works well with my mouse too. I wouldn't be upset at anyone who doesnt want to pay for this product in full, but i do feel it is worth the money .
Very happy with easy install and great ride ordering was a breeze reccomended to my friends already couldn't beat the price .
The shipping was lightning fast and I am loving the product so far, cannot wait to see the results after a few weeks!! The texture feels a tad gritty until you rub it in; basically has no smell which is great; feels like it is really working after application! Will report back at that time :) I highly recommend YouTurn and Life Essentials Warehouse .
The book came very quickly. I love Ashley & JaQuavis books  and stay searching for them they keep me wanting more and this book so far has me not wanting me 2 put it down .
There was no way I wasn't going to read this after the first 1 then 2 not going 2 sayvthis is one of my favorites but was a good read .
After I read book 1 I couldn't wait for book 2 and now I'm screaming for book 3 I love this story line the characters are very easy to love or love 2 hate .
I have read the whole book series I live love & stay reading Ashley & JaQuavis books and this turned out to b one of my favorites I can't wait for the spin off so excited .
I ordered this dress on a friday had it by Monday. So shipping was excellent ! The dress is beautiful the color is much brighter red then I thought. But all in the same a very pretty dress and I can't wait to hav my granddaughter in it for Christmas pictures. I will be ordering again very soon .
Very pleased with this remote no more &#8593; & &#8595; letter selection!!! keyboard is awsome & the front face is exactly like the one that comes with the tv so its very easy to use .
This book made me realize that there is so much more to life and to not take any day for granted. It can always be worse! As a veteran myself, I can somewhat relate to Justin. I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone. I'm pretty sure, actually I know for a fact, that the majority of authors do not talk to their readers on a day to day basis like he does. If you are looking for a book that you can't put down, get this book!! It is worth it.Amanda S .
The seller did good job, fast delivery and good quality product. But the content of the DVD is not so interesting for kids. My children didn't watch them at all. It is bit boring for them .
They are built sturdy and look amazing. BUT watch what size you get. I got them for my ole lady for Halloween, she has bigger feet for a girl so I got a large. I wear a size 12 and they fit me lol. She can wear them but I almost got her an xl because she wasn't sure they would fit. But besides that they showed up on time and are a great product .
It arrived FAST. I love the poster. It was a little grainy but not enough to really upset me and I'm understanding since it is from an old film .
I was worried it wouldn't fit on my CYMA ak 47 but it fit like a charm. When I started putting it on it was kind of sloppy but as I screwed it on ot got less sloppy and by the end it was perfect. No wiggle, and looks sweet .
I haven't used it in a tournament yet but it has alot of power behind it... I love the realistic weight and the grip feels amazingly comfortable... I love the whole set up .
It's good quality, it's got a good rating rate on full auto. But the clip is cheaply made, I had I super glue the side of it because it cracked the first time I pulled it out but it's fine now, and it doesn't shoot far but I was using .20 grams. I can't complain though, it's a great secondary .
Set in 1911, this is not a historical novel or a traditional ghost story, but rather a satire of the values of modern China and the interior conflicts caused in the era of globalization.The protagonist Ling Ling, a happy courtesan, seems to have more in common with her modern day counterparts than with the girls of her age. She has an obsession with all things foreign and likes to learn English from her clients.While I was reading this book I was convinced that the writer was trying to convey his experiences in China. Instead of wasting time to create a convincing period setting, he lays on the table the sexual obsessions of the male expat population of South East Asia. Remember that sleazy character portrayed by Russell Crowe in Man With the Iron Fists? All the males in this novel are like that!! But hey, you don't expect much subtlety from a book with a chapter named F******* The Bouncer.After the middle of the novel the heroine finds herself drawn into an affair with a British gentleman who promises to take her to Hong Kong, but she is not really sure if she really wants that. There is also the riddle of the ghost which makes random appearances throughout the story. These parts could have been scarier, the author seems to have knowledge of the Chinese belief system but he fails to utilize these scenes to create some sort of tension. At least there is a bit of deconstruction when it comes to revealing the identity of the ghost. It's not a shadow of the past but rather the other way round.In the final page the writer wraps everything up with a nice little twist which owes to the Resident Evil films.I'm wondering what's the next book Ray plans to write about China. Maybe something along the lines of American Psycho .
I purchased this bed a couple of months ago. When I first slept in the bed I didn&#8217;t like it. The bed felt to firm. I now have had the bed for a couple of months now and I would say that I love it. I no longer wake up with back pain. It will take some time to allow your body to adjust to the beds firmness. I personally do not like firm beds. But I would say I&#8217;m happy that I purchased this bed .
Funny game from way back when. Controls are a little wonky but only because I don't have an actual controller .
If you bought this book and utilize it, you're a deplorable excuse for a parent, and you shouldn't have children at all.God is love, and he doesn't rule by fear.Why would you even think to follow the words of such disgraceful human beings?Amazon, you should probably remove this book before more children are beaten to death .
It's a really nice skirt. Fits as expected so I'll probably go a size up next time being that this skirt doesn't reach my ankles (I'm pretty tall .
Ordered this book for my brother and he said he &#34;liked it&#34; Nothing wuz wrong with it. Pretty good book according ii him. I would recommend this book ii someone who likes ii read .
This product was ok i might add. I purchased this item because i couldn't find it anywhere else. Everything seems to be ok with this product .
I gave this a 3 because it did not look anything like it wuz on amazon. I actually believe it wuz a bit small from the photo on amazon .
This dvd was ok. Some parts i liked and some i didn't so i rated it neutral. Its wuz ok .
I like the color and the shoe in general. I would recommend these. Price a little STEEP (NOT including shipping) Overall, very nice purchases .
I chose this rating because these shoes are TOO snug and tightly fitted. I wouldn't recommend these ii anyone. I like the color and shoe in general but when I put my feet in them, my toes cramped up .
I CHOSE THIS RATING BECAUSE I NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD RECEIVE THIS SMALL PACKAGE. I DISLIKED THIS PRODUCT. I DISLIKE THIS PRODUCT. I DISLIKE THIS PRODUCT. I WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND THIS ANYONE .
I love Carol's Daughter hair butter. There's NO WHERE else you can find Carol's Daughters product except Amazon. I have already recommended this ii some people. Great product and works like a charm .
I like the amount you get but they simply burn SLOW! Don't know why or how but they do! Are they suppose ii burn slowly .
Neutral rating for this product! I didn't HATE or DISLIKE it but i wish it would stood out a little more! Unsure if i would recommend this but i know i bought it for me .
This rating was chosen because the scent wuznt really strong enough. Meaning, it did and it didn't have a strong smell like the other ones. Good products tho' .
This dvd i have not open yet. So therefore, i give it a neutral. I do believe when i watch it, it will be good .
This was a neutral product! Meaning i didn't hate or dislike it but i LIKED it! I would probably recommend this product ii someone who like plug-ins and wants their place ii smell good .
Never heard of these oils before but decided to give them a try! Only thing i can say is they were neutral .
This item is NOT as described on website. Definitely dislike this item. Would NOT be back ii buy more in the future .
I chose this rating because I love this shirt! There's nothing ii dislike about this shirt! Of course, I would recommend this ii ANYBODY! THANKS .
I chose this rating because that's just my opinion. I dislike this item (bag was dirty and seemed old) Not sure who i could recommend this item to .
Wise and clever purchase i have made. Everything about it i like and with NO disappoinments. Will be back in the future .
candles were way too small. didn't know they would be that size. it was an ok purchase. i dont think i would recommend it .
One thing people should know BEFORE purchaing this case, its a snap on! I thought it would be ALL RUBBER! I dislike it because i feel i got cheated and i would have to say i wouldn't recommend this to anyone .
I like this case! It fits so well with my phone! Since my wall charger didn't fit, I cut the two black pieces off (case on the inside) and now I can plug my wall charger into it! Good buy for me and I would recommend it ii someone else .
So glad I bought this case. I LOVE it. I chose this rating because my Pantech Flex fits this case very well. I would definitely order another one and I even ordered another one for a family friend. You CANT find otterboxs for Pantech Flex NO WHERE except amazon. THANKS .
Cool sweater. Fits perfect. And even feels good on my body. I recommended this ii someone already. Comes in great colors as well. I already ordered the pink one. Nothing ii dislike about this and the price was good too .
Got tired of buying WalMart flags that rip apart. I now have one of these at my home on Lake Superior (very windy) and one for the flag pole at work. 3 months in...color still good and no rips .
I ordered this  9.5mm IDE Optical Bay Hard Drive Adapter Caddy  for my non-unibody black macbook. Instead, I received a  Micro SATA Cables - 12.7mm SATA Optical Bay Hard Drive Adapter Caddy  in the mail. Although very similar, definitely not compatible with my macbook as the optical bay cable does not fit into that caddy. Unfortunately I didn't realize this until I disassembled my macbook to install it. And I'm unable to exchange it thru Amazon.com and they can only offer me a full refund to try to order from Micro SATA Cables again. But since they can't seem to process orders correctly, Amazon recommends I order from another website to ensure I get the correct one...Back to searching the internet to find a caddy again for me .
This item showed up and it is made poorly. And there is a large footprint on the inside of this bread box. Not sure how it got there but it is the print of a large work boot. Not very satisfied with this item .
Beautiful!  I bought this set to replace my lost set.  Was feeling a bit naked.  It was well worth the cost.  I'm allergic to nickle and have had no problems since they arrived.  You can't tell they aren't the real thing.  I would definitely recommend .
I won't buy these again.  Bought them for a party, every one of them leaked!  Don't bother it's a waste of money .
These subs are amazing! My buddy and I did the install on them about a month ago in my ford explorer. They sounded amazing after he tuned them for me(on the amp). first song we turned on was excision shambahala 2010 or 2011 and it was shaking the whole car! for as small as these things are, they can be heard from down my block. I have not had a problem with my battery dying because we hooked up the power wire to a fuse in a pannel that turned on when Turn car turned on and off when the car turned off. the amp that comes with this kit id plenty to push these subs. these are well worth the money! I also have a sub out feature on my radio, so it makes them hit even harder  when i turn that up. ! get these subs! i guarantee you will love them .
After a little tuning i got it to work, and let me tell you it is by far the best machine i have! Lines are way more crisp and follow thru very nicely. By ordering this you would have done yourself a huge favor. Only problem i have is that i can not rate it 10 stars .
Somehow I didn't know about this type of magnified flashlight/headlamp before but it certainly converted me. Other lights are twice to 3X as much and they don't seem near as bright, and didn't zoom .
Very protective not all that see-through but it shows my phones skin, which I purchased accidentally, sort of well. Instead of clear I'd call this color transparent white or semi clear. Overall I like it. Had to buy a screen protector though, this do sent do anything to protect the front of your phone .
Wonderful imagination and adventure! A very different style of writing which was well enjoyed. Can't wait to see the movie .
I could hardly wait to open the box but believe me it was worth it. The soft leather and quality impressed me  tremendously. I had looked at several other jackets at higher prices and they could not match the authenticity presented with this jacket and what's great about it is time will only make it better. The size is perfect and all the details are great. I would and will highly recommend this jacket. I am proud of this jacket and to what it represents. Thanks.Hal Lauderdale .
It's a very good app it on my froze once so that's good  and there is no more complaints yup .
This movie is awsome!!! It is one of my moms favorite movies that is why she made me order it on amazon when I told her they had it. That's when you know netflix ain't playing nothing good .
Love this chair!!! So far I have no complains. I like the neutral colors and that it is safe for my baby .
I don't really this this product. I had tried it a few years back and it was ok...this bottle I got though it's really clumpy no matter how long I stir for the clumps don't dissolve .
I have a six month old that is in the stage of just playing with toys that make sounds so I thought this toy would be great but the sound really sucks, you can't really hear anything...so she didn't like it. I guess you get what you pay for, right .
As the RN for a Bariatric Surgery Center I get the opportunity to sample many protein drinks.  This is my favorite protein drink. Not only is it low in Carbs, low calorie, high in protein, it also has great flavor .
i love them as they are not only well made and very sturdy but they look so good also when wearing them .
my wife loves these shirts and is wearing them all the time they are not only well made but they look good too .
i love my phone it works so very well and the answering machine lets me never miss and important call .
i am not happy with it as it only lasted a few months and quit working so it is in the trash .
so nice i love it instant results. i never had one that did not require putting inside ones body it is so nice .
i love this radio as it not only works very well it needs no batteries as it gets its power from the sun also there is a hand crack to charge it if there is no sunlight .
it is good to have and was so easy to get.  i will keep it for use for a big item that i don't have money to pay for immediately but still would like to have .

i am so happy with my film guards it protects my kindle which no doubt keeps me so very happy .
i wear 3 xl this 4x too small had to give it away great deal someday i will learn not to buy in the mail .
I definitely love the check book cover its holding up great. The only down side is trying to make sure it does not become to dirty because its made out of fabric .
i didn't think that i could get this item here...was looking something special for a present qnd this shows up thanks .
No substitute for having the right tool for the job, Good working tool. Easy  to maintain and sharpen Good value .
One of  device or tool , you hope never gets used. I ceiling mounted easy to install less than 15 min .
Width of webbing 1 1/4 vs 1 1/2 I guess price should have told me. Width not mentioned in AD .
Product was as advertised. Price and quality was as advertised.Only suggestion have like color pillow cases as an option have not washed yet we will see what happens .
A great book that I couldn't put down. Can't wait to read the other books in the Witch Mountain Series. The author grabs the readers attention right from the beginning. Esmeralda is full of surprising events that will keep the reader guessing .
It didn't workI want a replacement but i domt know how to return it.It wont charge amd it wont turn on .
So my boyfriend wanted to surprise me with flowers for our anniversary but we're in a long distance relationship and honestly ordering flowers through a florist shop is ridiculously expensive so i told him to look online, on amazon, because it's cheaper and he did but i also told him to read the reviews which, of course, he forgot.So i looked it up to see if they did have good reviews and i was a little skeptical and not sure how they would come out to be but they are absolutely beautiful. I loved them, they didn't look as beautiful as in the picture but that's every advertisement but they still look, and smell, absolutely amazing. They came fresh and bloomed completely the second day. The vase was different and big but that wasn't the point.Overall, I loved them and they we're beautiful and very colorful .
Best  game ever and perfect  for girls who want to be a salon. I love this game I never get off my kindle fire for a long time .
These sheets are not worth the shipping costs.  They are substandard to the big-box retail sheets I took off the bed!  They are too thin and too loose weave to be 600 anything, and rough to the touch.  single ply?  really? don't bother .
Best book i've ever found. I've never done ANY programming before so this is my first book and it's teaching me everything from Console.WriteLine("Hello World!"); to more advanced trainings. Totally worth the money .
Excellent prose.  He writes like a sailor.  I'm used to reading peer-reviewed journals, so the lack of citations within the text was different for me.The book is very officer-centric.  For instance, the author writes that after one battle, an officer surveyed the dead and injured and saw, &#34;entirely too many Academy rings&#34;;  never mind that most of the dead were, of course, enlisted, and they were dead because of the mistakes that officers made.  For the most part he lays out what the admirals and captains did without judging them.  The US Navy's learning curve was very steep during the Guadalcanal battles.  As an old sailor, it was heartbreaking and maddening to see them make the mistakes they did.There was some Regionalism there too.  He writes about how some of the country folk talked with such thick accents that others (probably meaning officers) couldn't understand them, and that many didn't even know relative bearings (stupid hicks) and the officers had to resort to clock positions to communicate with them.  Of course naval OFFICERS were already using such bearings in the heat of combat, and they still do.  They're called Naval AVIATORS.Several chapters later, he does give some credit to the bravery that these country folks had in combat.  James Webb's &#34;Born Fighting&#34; and several other books are finally giving the &#34;poor white country boy&#34; (AKA redneck, hick, hillbilly etc) some of the credit they deserve for the bravery, toughness, and intellect they naturally have, but the inate bigotry that Horfischer and most of America has towards them was still apparent .
I've owned several Littmann Master Cardiology stethoscopes over the years (for some reason Littmann's tend to develop Peyronie's disease, and then crack after a few years).  I've spent many years in cardiology and critical care and became a bit of a snob about Master Cardiology scopes.I bought the Master Classic because it was cheaper and much lighter. I moved into family practice and didn't think I needed a cardiology scope anymore anyway.I have been very surprised by the resolution and sensitivity.  It can pick up grade I murmurs and s3/s4s no problem.  I honestly think it's the best scope I've ever owned.A cardiology scopes claim to fame is that they are dual lumen, but if you think about it, both lumens are funneled into a chest piece with one arpeture anyway.  There's only one chest piece so you won't get stereo sound no matter how great the tubing is.Almost half the price and the same resolution.  Heck, with the single diaphragm the Master Classic even looks like a Master Cardiology to others unless they study it really close .
Very high quality.  Pops on in about 30 seconds I used a simple ball point pin to depress the tab,  just remember to place your thumb over it when you slide the old one off!  I use an IWB holster and noticed it had a slight rough spot that bit into my love handle.  Took my ol' lady's emory board to it and it was gone in a few swipes.I have an XD 9 subcompact, so it's always been a little flippy.  Now I just put more pressure on the pinkies to &#34;pre-load&#34; my grip as I draw a bead and squeeze of a round.  Double taps are much easier, especially with the frisky Hornady Critical Duty rounds I carry in it now.Since I carry at 4 o'clock IWB it doesn't print any worse with the extension on, and I even have it canted over about 45 degrees because of my long arms.Competely beneficial, cheap, and strong.  It wll probably be around longer than you or I will.  I love it .
Mod #1I have long arms and legs.  My elbows fall at about my waist line, so I had to can't the holster over as far as it could go in order to quickly draw my gun.  When I withdraw the gun, the indentation on the weaver rail very slightly grabs on the kydex.  I can draw the weapon, but sometimes the holster trys to go with it.  Twisting my wrist as if I'm trying to straighten out the gun as I'm drawing it can maximize the space between the rail and the kydex and stop this from happening. The problem is, I don't know if I will remember to do this if the heat is on.The kydex is too brittle and is secured too tightly to the leather to heat and bend.  Really I think this is a design flaw, and cannot be modified out of any of these types of holsters, unless the kydex goes the full length of the gun.  How I aleviated the problem was to, get ready for this, take a file to the gun.Yup,  I got a coarse file and carefully made one pass at a time across only the distal part, that little nub; testing after each one.  Once I'd filed about 1/2 mm from it (about 1/4 to 1/3 of the entire bulk of the nub), it started clearing w/o a problem.  After that, I took an emory board and smoothed out the rough filed-down part.  There's enough of the "nub" left that if I ever use the rail it will work.  You can't even see it.  I suspect that you people with normal skeletons won't have to kick the gun so far over, so it may not snag with you.Mod #2On my particular gun the leather back had to be trimmed a little so the web of my hand would be snug against the "beaver tail" of the gun.  These guns are really sweet, but look at them.  The bore axis is already pretty far from the web of your hand already, right?  Well, if the holster keeps you from "choking up on the bat", as you first grasp the grip, the bore axis will be even farther out.  Add a 3 inch barrel with some +P ammo, and muzzle flip will be a problem.So, I got some straight tin snips, and just like the other mod, snuck up on it by removing a little bit of the leather at a time until I could grasp the gun with the web of my hand snuggly up against the beaver tail before drawing.  After that I got out the trusty emory board and rounded and smoothed all the edges.Now, when I draw, the gun doesn't snag, and the hand-to-bore axis distance is minimized as much as possible.  I hated to do it, but it was either this or extreme orthopedic surgery .
The finishing is horrible, the umbrella is not strong at all; it does not worth a dime.I feel so bad for my money, it is like throwing a fortune into a gabage. That was a big disappointment. It is a shame to market such a &#34;good for nothing&#34; product for that expensive amount .
My Daughter loves the Land Before Time series and we now have all 13 Movies.  The Stone of Cold Fire is #7 in the series.  Its not one of my favorites, but my 6 year old daughter thought it was great and has watched it multiple times since we received it 1 month ago.  This movie includes 2 new characters visiting from "beyond the mysterious beyond" space.  If your family loves land before time characters like ours does you must include this movie in your library .
One of History's saddest events, I mean in the discipline of History, was the premature death of Richard Hofstader.With this book, the last he wrote, not finishing it, he also was making a turn in his writing career. Most of his previous work was analytic social history, more like sociology than what the popular mind may consider as history. Although that work was excellent and he proved himself an accomplished essayist, with this one he proves he has an excellent touch with narrative history. He can still singe right through to the heart of what makes the period studied a period that, whatever our superficial technological guises, we still live in.We have moved past slavery, which was so entrenched in American social structure in 1750. But the persistence with which Americans pursued slavery, as if they perceived it was the only way to build a nation and a new kind of nation, one built purely on self-interest, brings the reader to realize that the nation we live in now remains built on slavery. The vast semi-middle classes and lower classes remain slaves to their debased tastes, their lives must remain empty and out of their will's control so that their master's, the tiny set of property and power holders, may prosper and keep building, all for their own prospering only. At the same time, the masters tell these slaves it is all done for the glory of--back then it was "God," now it is sometimes "God" and sometimes everyday mammon.Hofstadter also lets us see the centrality of religion in everyday American life at the same, another factor which has altered only superficially. If America continues to punish the flesh and look to some vague point in the future when God will make everything right, the precedence was there at 1750. If now we seem to live for today, it is not in terms of fully enriching ourselves within the potentials of this world below, but only in terms of momentary indulgences to keep us preoccupied until some dim future when all will be resolved and explained. Candy and candy music are the so-called indulgences, much as prayers and verse-reading were the momentary indulgences to keep the body bearing through this world until the next appeared.Always, Hosftadter reveals, without preaching. The reader can draw the conclusions, even if Hofstadter's brilliant supply of facts leads the careful reader to see the connections between yesterday and today. Considering this book came out four decades ago, it teaches a hard lesson, that the more America thinks it progresses, the more it becomes its same old self .
I buy this book because I thought it contained an account number.But still I purchases an account ....It is not worth it without the code .
It is not in good condition~heavy scratches and can just work~I used just once for 3 months and  traded it in ~But it can not be traded because of its bad condition .
I never use it because it never fits in my camera....I just throwed it away...Never buy cheap things .
I hate stories of snarling wolves and big bad bears, I hate the freezing cold (that's why I live in the South), I'm not a fan of planes especially small planes and I don't even know why I decided to read this because of all those things mentioned. Bonnie Leon's writings kept me on the edge of my seat. She also touched my heart with sorrow and joy.  CAN'T WAIT FOR ALASKAN SKIES BOOK #2 .
I trust otter box for my iPhone 4S because even if I accidentally drop my phone &#34; which I don't &#34; I feel that my loving iPhone is safe .
I didn't really buy this to use for my iPhone I buy this for my hello kitty collections. I used it for a little bit and the I kept it. Because I don't want to mess it up .
I received it in the mail but it was only the case I did NOT receive the other things that was suppose to be with it. It is just the case part with nothing else .
it was a great phone but my phone carrier would not switch it over so I had to send it back. I had no problems getting refunded my money back. They r great to work with. Thank you so much .
did not see any of that coming! now onto the 3rd book. the end of this book has got me all sorts of confused .
didn't see the baby part coming! but wow! great book! I want a wedding! and a baby! well that's my ending .
I laughed, I cried, I was angry, sad, and happy! such a good book! can't wait to see what else willow comes up with .
Love the book, but the cover was broken badly when I received it. It wasn't packed well, not at all .
I purchased these for a class project and was very pleased with the price and quality of these stands!!! They are simple and nice!!! Perfect as they will accent and not draw away from the creations....Great shipping...love them....will do this again .
Horrible game it was a total rip off of your money if I were you do not buy this game .
I love these! The instructions were easy to follow and allows for multiple applications. The smaller size was perfect for my mouth. (Recommended for a noticeable, but subtle look. Choose the large fangs for a more dramatic effect) I could talk &#34;almost&#34; perfect. Some letters and words were hissed more than spoken. Simple to remove for eating and drinking, then fit easily back into place for the evening. It's the perfect compliment to any vampire costume. I can't wait to show them off for Halloween! So glad I made this purchase, there cool and fun .
It arrived very quickly and was true to its pruduct desciption. Although, it doesn't offer the most support,  it does do well when placed just right under your garments. It's discreet enough to wear with dresses, halters and tank tops. I would still wear something, (tank, bandeau, or cami) to hold you in to avoid any embarrassing incidents. I would recommend this product if your looking for an inexpensive way to wear your favorite clothing without wearing a conventional bra .
I previously read the reviews for this ring and thought, well, it sounds like the other customers really liked it. I made my purchase and within 3 days it arrived.....and it was absolutely stunning! The photos can't possible depict how beautiful, elegant and real this looks. I ordered a size 5 and it was perfect! I would recommend to others and look forward to making another breathtaking purchase in the future .
Dan Brown has lost his touch.  It starts out with a great concept/idea and goes nowhere with it.  Normally I look forward to the tidbits of history I learn but this had none.  Unless you're a Dante buff this was just an average read centered around a good premise that goes nowhere.  A book that builds up, builds up and then just leaves you saying "that's it .
Its alright, came undone easy on the sides and the front there were no other guards to protect the front from falling off. When I dropped it, it all came apart. Very unsatisfied .
I like  the multiple sizes available. The product itself works well, and wasn't a big fuss to get set up.  :- .
Just the right amount of coffee for one person, and the flavor is incomparable.  I had a little trouble with minor overflowing when I took the carafe off before the brewing cycle was complete, but once I became familiar with its sounds, I was able to prevent this.  Great little coffee maker, and very happy that it is BPA free .
I did not receive Rachmaninov: The Bells / The Spring; instead, I received Rachmaninov: Symphony No. 3 / The Isle of the Dead.  I decided to keep that recording, since these are also works that I love.  However, I still would like to receive the recording that I ordered .
All the information I was able to gather on this mat cutter said that it is 40 inches, but when I got it, I found out that it is actually 45 inches long.  I have not used it yet, due to lack of space, but my wrist is healed enough that I have been able to use my old mat cutter.  I feel sure that when I have enough space to set out the Logan Simplex and learn to use it, I will like it better than my old one .
I have this app on my kindle fire and I use it all the time! If I need a verse and I don't remember the reference, all I have to do is type in a word phrase and it comes up! (Others verses with the same word phrase come up too which is great when you need to write a devotion, sunday school lesson or sermon based around a single topic.) I recommended this app to my Pastor and now he uses it all the time. 5 stars for sure .
I was very pleased with this book. I read it in a little less than half a day. I couldn't put it down! I'm definitely going to read the sequel next .
I love this shampoo and condtioner. It makes my hair feel soft and clean. I'm so glad amazon is selling it now. I went back the using vo5 shampoo and it dose not make my hair feel the way the loreal shampoo does I would recomed this shampoo if you want you hair to feel clean and smooth .
This book was nothing more than an enjoyable way to pass a Sunday afternoon while the hubs watched football. I enjoyed the plot and the story. Is it one of those stories that I'll remember in a month, six months or a year? No, not at all...but for a free book it didn't disappoint and I'm happy to have read it. The plot never got too detailed, the story never FULLY developed, but I can live with it .
Sooooo....I don't even really know where to go with this review. I bought this as a box series, expecting it to contain all parts of the story lol, and come to find out, nope! There's going to be not one, but TWO more books to this series! I'm sorry but for $10 a book, I'd like a little less sex (I skip right through the sex scenes anyway, I read for the romance, not the sex) and more freaking closure! About 50% of the way through this series, I got so fed up and bored with it that I didn't read it for a couple weeks. Then I remembered I paid a lot of money for this stupid series so I was going to finish it. Imagine my disappointment when I didn't get any closure. The first two books were pretty good, the third was fluff and I won't be reading the last two. I bought this because I heard it as being better than fifty shades, and I can assure you it was not .
I actually really enjoyed this book, which was shocking because I don't normally have much success with the free books. The writing was fantastic, there were so many twists and turns you didn't expect. You know when you read a book, normally by the time you get a quarter of the way through, you've figured out how it's going to end? Well that didn't happen here! There was a lot going on, but it didn't get busy and it didn't take away from the story line at all. I highly recommend this book, and I'm off to go looking for some more by this author .
I really can't say enough positives about this book. I stayed up until 230 to finish it, and then was bummed that I didn't have the foresight to buy the second in the series before and there I was stuck without internet. Needless to say I came to the internet cafe brought and early to get the second in the series and I can't wait to read it. I hope it doesn't let me down, because the first book really is going to be hard to top...but reviews sounds like she did it, so I'm excited! If you're on the fence about buying this book, I PROMISE it will not disappoint. I laughed out loud, I smiled, yes, I even cried .
I liked the idea behind the book, who doesn't love a princess fairytale romance after all? However, I felt like when it came to the dialogue and writing, it seems rushed and a little TOO much like a fairytale for my own personal liking. On one hand, it's refreshing to read a book without much negativity in it, but on the other it's completely unrealistic. For a free book though, can't complain too much .
AHHHH! Is anyone else else religiously stalking kindle books waiting for book number three to come out?! I think if I even had a release date that would be something to look forward to...but this is driving me crazy! Haha I'm not good with cliff hangers, and this one definitely left us hanging! And in case anyone hasn't figured it out by now, I whole heartedly recommend these books .
When I first started reading this book I wasn't overly into it for dinner reason, I won't lie. And I honestly can't even remember when it sucked me in but before I knew it I had finished the whole thing! I laughed out loud so many times, I probably sounded mental, but it was just a great read. Definitely recommend .
I am absolutely become thrilled with this kitchen! I researched kitchens literally for weeks on end. I had very specific criteria I was looking for. It HAD to be gender neutral, as I have both a boy and girl. It HAD to be big enough for 2 kids to pay together, HAD to have a refrigerator AND FREEZER, and it had to be tall enough for my taller-than-average 5 year old. This fits everything! Assembly is very time consuming, and for me it took me a minute to fully understand the directions, however, once I got it,itflew by. I put it together by myself in just a little over 3 hours. I HIGHLY recommend a drill for this project. I can't imagine how tedious this would have been screwing everything in with a screw driver. Then that way, you don't have to worry if a few holes don't line up perfectly (which I didn't experience any of anyway.)  I can't wait to give this to my kids for Christmas .
I really wanted to like this book. To be honest, it's not very often that I start a book that I just can't finish. I FORCED myself to get to the 46% Mark and that was it. I really don't have super crazy high expectations when it comes to books. It's just a way for me to relax and not have to think about anything...well this plot was SO confusing, I had to think entirely too much to follow along. The perspective would change out of nowhere, the timeline is completely messed up, it seems like so much happens within a week...I just couldn't do it. I think the author has potential, it was a good story line, but it's all over the place and really the timeline of events is inexcusable .
I REALLY, REALLY wanted to fall in love with this book. The first and second books were so captivating, I checked religiously for this third book to come out. The great thing with Layla and Trip has always been their struggles. It made their triumphs so much more amazing. And this book just seemed too...idk...grown up lol. I mean naturally this would be the progression, I guess, but for a reader, it doesn't leave a lot to keep our attention. I actually stopped halfway through and considered not finishing it...but decided I would see it through. The first two books in this series will remain a favorite of mine forever, but this last book, I won't really think about it again after this review .
i love the bedding set, just wish the seller described all that came in the set. but im glad I found this one because i did not like all the animal or sport themes that are out there and was just looking for the colors. the set is a perfect match and is what i envisioned .
The boots were actually pure white color like i was hoping. great fur on them but i wish there were more pictures of it and better description before i bought them because they are not leather, they are some kind of material i've never seen shoes to be made out of, so that was a little disappointing but otherwise cute .
Don't bye it. The knob to open the safe was jammed and would not turn. When we were finally able to lift the safe door, the lock was loose inside and was not working. The whole structure is very flimsy and made out of plastic, so I 'm not reccomended .
I have played this game about 40 times, and it never fails my expectation.Its unpredictability makes this game replayable and enjoyable.This game has quite simple rules and requires only two to four players. It is very approachable .
As I say, you must fact with the dull black screen and never add a widget to the home screen. It makes me angry .
Over all a good, cheap tablet. My 6 your old loves it. The camera leaves something to be desired but not really surprised because of the cost .
The book is not only beautiful (thick shiny pages with full color illustrations that rival a $300 university text book) but the content is very well written and easy to implement.This book is a MUST read for anyone in business that wants to connect with their prospects and clients digitally .
If you are a fan of Lovecraft and somehow haven't read this yet, you will not be disappointed. If you don't know of Lovecraft's work, here's a good starting point. Enjoy .
They fir just fine looked great...However they have an awful chemical smell even after several washes in hot water smell make my skin super itchy and I was not able to return them for a refund so I got stuck with them..I love wall flower jeans but this was just a horrible experience and I cannot wear them .
Amazing brand with excellent glasses for pilots or driving. Delivery was swift as expected. Only the quality of the case was not as good as it should be. The inner liner came loose after just a few days. But its easily repairable .
Ah another marvelous thing this men's watch is the most wonderful, guarantee I have never see it has 10 years battery which you will never think of buying battery for ten year and it has the most standard timing and date so things like that, what are you waiting to go in for it .
Hey this shoe is really very good and so much comfortable to wear  and I really love it and am urging each and everyone to go in for it, you shall never regret it .
I hate this phone because it is not good phone. It is the worst phone I have ever have and I really regret why I bought it. It is here with me and I do not know what to do with it because it is not working. It can charge, it can swift on and I cannot return it because the seller did accept me to return it. So people let any one buy this phone other wise you will regret it as I regret it .
This thing is for show.  It won't protect your phone, doesn't hold its color and broke in two spots after one drop that was probably six inches.  You get what you pay for .
Perfect read.  Such a talented writer.  I can't wait to get to the rest of Mishka's work!  Highly recommended for just about anyone .
worst  29 cash iv ever spent don't bother with it you will just be wasting your cash just to uninstall the game not long after it downloads .
the game its self is nice but the controls are wonky  the targeting janks everywhere but where you want it to if that was fixed i would have no issues .
Kenney's novel, Radiance, is an amazing poetic journal through life...in a novel.  Very skilled at painting relationships, emotions, and people through words, it should not surprise anyone that he is also a poet.  Take a day, outside in the sun or inside while rains, make a reading nest, and dive in.  Once you start reading it is hard to put down; you might be there awhile. It is clear that a lot of work and emotion went into this book.  Get it now...you won't be sorry .
The recipes are very easy.  I love this cookbook. I can't  wait for another one to come out.  It's great .
Terrible, poorly written. Super boring,got absolutely nowhere fast. I kept waiting for something exciting to happen and it never did. It's better as a cookbook .
All the features of this app works well and its being sold at a good price but that comes with a price. Every 10-20 seconds your service is interrupted by these pop ups. I can't take it anymore. I'm going to UN install this app after I place this review. DoN't GET IT .
This case works great.  Very slim, not sure why some people said it is bulky.  Easy to put on the phone and the button and switches are still very easy to use.  I would buy this case again and again .
I have had this watch for a couple of weeks and the band has already broken three times. The first two times I could put it back but now the whole thing is busted so I highly recomend that no one should buy this watch at least from amazon. Buy it at a store so you can get your money back because now I'm out $25 .
Fabulous but don't make us wait that long again!!!! Time to start on another but have them release sooner this time the torture was unbearable .
A little too big and a little to flimsy. Ill still keep them though. I wouldn't recommend actually buying these if you want an ugg type boot .
I'm 5 foot 5 and these legs are sooooooo long. It's really stretchy. The pockets on the front and back have little purple gemstones. I will be removing them as I am not a 13 year old girl .
I really like this Case .. i feel like it protects my phone and it isn't too inconvenient to fold back the cover and use. It holds all my cards snugly and is really convenient ... I didn't give it 5 stars because it doesn't seem like it will hold up very long.. the spine of the case seems pretty flimsy but so far so good .
I like the fact that i'm not locked into one location using the roll stand. I live in a small apartment and like the ability to move the stand in the kitchen while preparing dinner,then back again to the bedroom or living room whenever i desire.My flat screen is in very good standing not near exceeding the weight limit. This would be great for most people considering a roll stand. It is working fantastic for my use .
Great to use it you don't want to slice the tips of your fingers off when using a mandoline. I learned the hard way. Best 8 bucks I've spent .
I am not happy with this product.  The price was right but the cover on the end you use on the kindle did not last.  I has torn off and I cannot use it anymore.  I guess I need to purchase a more expensive one .
I love these books, even though they are less advanced reading material than I am used to.  The story is great, and reading it on my kindle is even better!  I'm glad I no longer have to cart around actual books all the time, and if I finish one and want to start the next one I have it right there at my fingertips .
So normally I'm a mac person, but using my iPad outdoors was impossible.  I wanted something light and legible outside in the sunlight.  My mom has a regular Kindle and I always had my eye on it, but she told me it didn't really work well in direct or even bright sunlight.  After getting my Kindle Paperwhite in the mail I immediately had to test it out.  I was sitting outside before when I first started to play with it and I was not disappointed.  It is great outside, even in DIRECT sunlight.  It's also helpful to have the backlight at night, I can read without bothering my boyfriend with a light, but it's not too bright either.  I am 100% in LOVE with my Kindle Paperwhite and continually share its praises with anyone I have the opportunity to .
Think thing did not work AT ALL I hooked it up to my Xbox 360 then to my Monitor and it did not receive any signal AT ALL!!!DO NOT BUY THIS .
Hair was soft and pretty. The length was not correct and came with broken clip ins. okay product not the best .
The hair was soft and great hair, length was right. The problem I had was the hair was blonde not blonde brown .
This novel is about an era in History seldom visited. It takes place in the years  leading up to the destruction of three Roman legions in the German forest. It switches between the Roman point of view, as told by a young centurion and the Germanic  by a young tribal chief. Whilst the Roman left record of this era in history the German  tribes mans account is pure conjecture. Never the less the author &#34;fleshes&#34; the bones of history with a quite plausible account. Fast paced and told in an entirely believable  way .
For the price and quality on this station i am very happy with itPros:pricequalityget hot fasteasy to maintainCons:the solder gun does not fit the hand so wellplastic clips holding the hoses together started braking the first daydoes not come with multiple solder tips...only came with one .
Bought this costume for my grandson who is into dinosaurs.  He loved the costume and when he went trick or treating the people didn't know what kind of dinosaur he was and he informed them that he was a raptor. The costume was easy to get on and off and kept him warm on a cool night trick or treating .
Summer of my German Soldier was a good book but may be frightening to younger reader due to the parent abuse and violence. These concepts would not be appropriate for young readers. Although I enjoyed this book, I would only give it 4 stars .
The review by Dr. Jacobs titled "Dangerous quackery" should not be taken lightly.One reviewer said this book is well written and easy to read.

I got my knife and it was better than I thought it is made of a strong durable material and its not too heavy and not too light and it is nice and sharp and it can handle any job that you put it up to over all it is a very good and wise purchase .
I can't stop reading the series even though I say each time that the story continues instead of ends that I'mNot reading any more. You only have to read one series and you are hooked. Thank you for the love-miseryNovella that I can't put down .
I really enjoy this storage shelf!!! It fit my space perfectly and looks great! The assembly was easy. It didn't take long to assemble at all! I love it .
from reading all other reviews i was expecting it to be so bad haha but its great!  i mean theres one tiny sparkle missing at the top & it doesn't cover the front of the screen but like come on people.. its $2 like what do u expect?!  i think this is more than perfect for it's price & it could even be worth more.  the color is true to the picture.  i mean i just expected it to be a little lighter but its literlly the exact same color as the picture.  main point is it fits great & I'm happy with it!  i will post a picture in a little bit .
i love this case.  its much cheeper than the other bunny cases PLUS it is the original rabito brand case!  the tail matches perfectly with the case itself and its lightweight and easy to put on and take off. the ears weigh slightly more than the rest of the case  so its not as snug at the top but you can't even notice that.  i would totally reccomend this and its more than worth it for the price .
i don't even know what to say besides im in love with it!  ive ordered other chargers on amazon and they never work so i waited a while before ordering this one and once i ordered it, it was totally worth it.  its works 100% great & its deff 10 feet long!  the color is darker than the pictures but its just too good to even care lol.  it also came over a month earlier than expected.  i ordered a case on the same day and that has yet to come and ive had this for almost a week now.  if you get this you totally wont regret it, its perfffffff .
my case just came in an hour ago and i love it!  although everyone says it's true to color, it isn't.  its slightly darker but its still really nice.  also the fade from blue to clear ist as dragged out as the picture but its still good.  also more than half the case is clear but in the picture its vise versa with the blue.  those are really my only complaints, other than that i am IN LOVE with the case!  also i had no idea the water droplet design was 3-d.  it feels sooo cool & it looks even cooler.  and for the price it is 110% worth it!  i totally recommend this case for everyone and anyone .
okay , well this case is really cute , it came on time, the color is right now , and its very chic . but i did have a problem with it , the pink part of the case is really tight . it completely ripped the privacy screen protector i had on my phone ! i don't know with the dip in the front is just to low , but it was really disappointing , i was really looking forward to this case . dont think i'll be using it .
I love old miniseries. They had every famous actor of the time. Even Wayne Newton and Elizabeth Taylor. Wouldn't happen anymore. Memories .
This book was not what I expected. It truly is a story of love, attraction and a bond that is stronger than the lines drawn by both parties. Excellent read .
The earphones did not work, and all adapter were a little difficult to plug in. Otherwise a great bargain!! The case is very nice and looks great on my tablet! At first I was a little concerned about ordering, now I could get hooked to amazon!! LOL .
If you're looking for outrageous than these are it! You get what you see in the picture! The frames are good and sturdy. They shipped the next day and I got them within 3 days of ordering. I couldn't be more satisfied .
This product seem to be worth the price at first, it has lots of places to bring the extras in. But once when I found out that it is not genuine leather(it said genuine leather on the cover) , I got disappointed because a little piece by piece of the black thing from the cover came off. Over all it's a great cover if you have extra paper/notes and pens to put in .
just a lie no effect at all not even a bit . do not buy it is a waste of money .
this product is just a lie it is a waste of money it does not work do not buy .
This book is amazing. Once I open this book, I could not stop reading. I will definitely recommend everyone to read this book. It is very empowering .
The phone connection is really bad both the phone connection to call and the wireless connection.  I went to the real samsung Service center in Indonesia and they say that it is a fake one. so DONT BUY FROM THIS SELLER YOU WILL BE UPSET WITH THE PRODUCT .
You are able to hear clearly but others can't hear or understand what you are saying unless you speak VERY loud .
I occasionally run a Queen of Hearts drawing on Saturday nights, so thought I would purchase this costume to add to the excitement of the drawing.  WHAT A WONDERFUL SURPRISE!!  This Costume is very well made, fits perfectly and looks AMAZING!!  I purchased this outfit last fall, have worn it MULTIPLE TIMES, have had it cleaned and it still looks FABULOUS!!  I am 5'7&#34; tall and must wear extra high heals since this is quite long, so if you're short, you will need to shorten it. I have a 38&#34; bust, so the outfit could not compliment my bust more perfectly!!  The collars need to be starched to stay up (or, you can add wire like I did), otherwise it does tend to be limp.  Ended up wearing it for a Halloween bash too!!  Would not hesitate to purchase again from this company .
I have been a customer with Hsu's Ginseng for many years. The tea tasts great and the packaging for each tea bag is very secure you can take then with you and not have to worry about the tea bag getting wet by accident .
Before I got the Bose Wave FM Antenna I had poor reception now the radio stations come in clear with no static .
Bought 2 for my mom and she loves them. The pans have a little weight to them, but there were no problems with the cake sticking to the pan. This is a great deal for the price .
I like the game but I can't figure how to log out of the game and get back to my cell phone dessktop .
The Targus AC adapter stopped charging my older ASUS laptop after a few weeks. I didn't know what happened since the charger's blue light diode still worked. I first bought a new battery, but that didn't help. I first learned that it was the AC adapter/charger only after trying the one from a new ASUS at the Microsoft store. Targus would not abide by their two-year guarantee because my model ASUS was't on their list of approved laptops even though current ASUS laptops and my model can use the same AC adapter/charger. I will never buy a Targus product again. Fortunately Amazon was willing to refund the cost .
For the price I couldn't get a better item. Apple wants way to much money for the same item.  This has worked just as well as theirs does .
this an action game with an awesome timing-based combat mechanics, beautifully animated platforming that ties well with its exhilarating chase scenes, epic crusader era setting, beautiful graphics (especially for it's time) all packaged into a open world playing field. its definitely a unique and fun experience, so do yourself a favor, don't miss out on this gem, just expect it to be another gta clone .
i bought this at around 60+ dollars that's why im a bit critical, the store, physical game and packaging, delivery, amazon etc are all good, so don't get me wrong, but after seeing the reviews, id like to add a bit of a counter point for the actual game (gameplay) itself.game is an rpg, you could still play it, but since its all in japanese, you would most likely not get immersed in the story and understand NONE of the dialog, all of which are beautifully voiced, but again in jap so you would just skip through all of it, and i think 30 percent of the enjoyment for the game is supposed to come from the story and the authentic voice acting, which we wont really get to appreciante.30 percent of your enjoyment would probably come from all the VFs that you could pilot, were all macross fans here, you wouldn't even be reading about this review if you weren't, so from VF-0s to the original &#34;made for this game&#34; VF-30, you'll get to collect all the VF that your heart desires-BUT if you've played the PSP macross games like i have, prepared to be disappointed, there's only the VFs here, the PSP games lets you pilot the SDF macross, quarter, frontier, galaxy, seven, vajra, clangclang, and all those other characters, but theres none of that here, you can only get the planes and some zentradi mechs, so it could get boring after a while, not to mention that all planes actually play and moves alike, except for having increasing adjustable points to speed, turning, etc, just like the psp games.40 percent would come from the gameplay itself, ive played the psp games, so thats why its probably not that new to me, but its fun to play your favorite VF, especially on fighter mode, so yeah its okay in regards to this aspect, controls are definitely better to other jap mech titles out there (dynasty warriors gundam, or A.C.E. r) but the missions and settings can get repetitive.to sum up, im not sure if well ever get another macross game after this, so this is probably the best that we have, sad that they already did SO MUCH on the PSP game, and if they could just port those game with better graphics, it would all we'll ever need, but instead we get this. the psp games lets you relieve moments from the tv shows, from catching minmay on your VF-1D, to defending the stage against vajra attackers from that last frontier movie, thats why for me, this game can really get disappointing. hope that the prices could go down, coz its not really worth the premium, just because its the only thing we have .
Luggage seems to be very well made. Have only used it once so far but, no problems and looks great. Well worth the money .
this DVD is really good for me - I have had some health issues during the past months and can not always go for a walk around my local park so the workouts on this DVD are giving me my exercise plus more - the workouts are fun - I have many of Denise Austin's DVD and find all of them to be great workouts .
This really is addictive. I can spend whole days playing this, if I'm not careful. Still wondering how to get the Tavern update. Please .
I like this game, even if it is cind of &quot;endless&quot;.  I like trying to see how  high I can score before I decide to do someting else.. Im just confused why I can't  play the 15th level. It just sits there. Can't open the level no matter what.  What gives? Why? Why? Why? Why?  Who? Who? What? Ghyvcdr, frdtyhbjiv. Rdesxctgvvh .
After putting in brand new batteries, the display numbers were not lit properly nor were they even the CORRECT numbers .
I have never read such a steamy and hot Erotic novel ever. If you're into sub novels, this is no doubt the one for you. It's hot as well as romantic and heart tugging all at the same time. As Jana begins to warm up to the f/f/m interaction, that's when the story gets hot. Every page, you will find yourself wishing you were on the next. It constantly keeps your heart pumping for more. You're gonna love Lisa's Gift by MacKenzie McKade. I recommend it .
works every time! just don't breathe it in .
The earrings are a really nice size and the quality of the diamonds are really great for the price. The diamonds are pretty clear, with not a lot of visible flaws to the naked eye.I had purchased another pair at the same price and the diamonds were smaller and cloudy - no sparkle at all.The diamonds in these earrings sparkle and my wife is happy to wear them .
Not my favorite flavors. The almond ones went bad by the time they got to me. They were really cool about it and refunded the right amount right away. Great customer service, just not my cup of tea when it comes to flavor .
You screwed up on my order.  I will never shop with you again !!!  take me off your emailing list .
Billy looked delicious eats nor brother saidSuch a good ingredient in this little pill ...Also don't eat all orders .
It's not what most people would describe as a poster.It's small in size(11x17 as described)with a very poor quality image.Only plus is the quality of the paper it was printed on and overall design .
The bow tie is absolutely beautiful. It looks very nice and it's very easy to put on. The red isn't too bright or too dark, it's perfect .
This is the third book by Kate Perry that I have read and each one is just as great if not better than the last.  She really knows how to pull you into the story.  She portrays each of her characters with real vivid emotions that you can relate to in your own life.  I catch myself laughing, crying, and sometimes even getting angry right along with the characters in her stories.  Close to You is another great hit by Kate Perry, I highly suggest reading any of her works!!!  If you're a romance fan like me you'll love her books .
Great story, can't wait to read the next book in the series.  This one really kept me hooked with the story line .
Was a captivating story from beginning to end. Could not put the book down. Even after finishing the story Im left wanting more. Thank goodness that there is a series, will definitely be reading them all and recommending to my paranormal romance loving friends .
Love this series.  You can actually feel the emotion portrayed by the characters.  I catch my self actually laughing and crying with them.  Very good writing!  Can't wait to read the next book .
Very Captivating!!  Its like an erotic roller coaster with a ton of emotions bundled into one.  Couldn't put any of these books down and as soon as I finished one book I was on to the next just as quick.  Chase and Jeff are both H-O-T!!  I caught myself hoping for Chase but rooting for Jeff.  Great Series would recommend to anyone that enjoys the &#34;Bolder&#34; romances .
The only sunscreen that I can use without having to deal with allergic reactions.  Total Block is based on zinc oxide, no chemical sunblocking agents.  Used it everyday for the past five years due to living in southwest USA .
Although born in North Dakota I didn't grow up there, so had heard stories of winter and storms in N.D. from my parents.This book brought to life the history of the people who settled in the mid west and the hardships they faced in such a vivid picture.  I felt like the families in the storm could have been neighbors of my ancestry. I also enjoyed a historical  understanding of early weather forecasting and the difficulties of communication to the people.Many thanks to David Laskin for this window on the past in North Dakota.Great,great, granddaughter of Sondre Nordheim,Roberta Pine Huston .
I love this book!!!!! I've read it like 5,000,000 times!!!!!! I can't wait for the next book!!!!!!!!! Tales from a not-so-happy heart breaker!!!!! I wonder what Nikki has in store for us next!!!!! I'm so existed how long till it comes out? Not until June, I think. I don't care I just can not wait!!!!! It's totes cool!!!! OMG I'm going kray-kray .
I like this book it pretty talks about everything I'm going to middle school and its a big help but I might not do everything the book says .
For those who enjoy Adventure Time it is a must. It has lots of information that aren't clear or even presented on the TV show.Besides, the best part of it is reading the characters notes scrambled all over the book.Great price for a great book .
The good about this book is that it doesn't contain much of the basics, which people going into interviews should already know .
If you're looking for an upgrade from Apples uncomfortable and poorly performing default headphones for the iPhone or you want to add microphone capability to your iPod touch, but you don't want to spend hundreds on offerings from marquis brand companies, then I highly recommend this product .
it's perfect. And it performs excellently. I wear it all the time whenever I go. It has a wonderful quality .
Unlike many other chargers, this one even shuts off by itself once it&#8217;s fully charged. This is very rare and very smart on their part. Since your juicer won't get fried even if you happen to forget to unplug it .
I like the design very much, it looks so special & cute for me. But the size isn't fit on me, if buy one size bigger, it would be great .
I have bad ear aches when I fly so I came across these and figured I would try them on my next flight. The plugs fit pretty well and they actually reduced the ear pain dramatically which I was so happy about. I'm sure they won't work for everyone but you need to try them since they are worth it if they do work. Flying without ear pain is so much better .
Maximus lube was very effective and helped provide some added pleasure to our bedroom but I felt the price was a little high for this sized bottle. Lube was not messy or sticky .
These tips are good to have since you go through them fairly quickly. The container that holds them can be a little better and that is only reason why this got four stars and no five. New container Gand this gets five stars .
I am not a big fan of sugared drinks and I always try to consume sugar free liquids. Red bull regular is a taste I do not like so I take the sugar free kind. This is better to mix with vodka too since you don't need more sugar with alcohol .
This mouth guard worked ok but it did not fit my mouth good so it was kinda uncomfortable to wear all night. I tried to heat it up and mold it differently but that did not work. I winded up returning this since it was more of a hassle to wear .
This was a very good purchase for the price. The quality is fine and the colors are good too. I do not expect much from baby socks except that they do not rip or fall apart from washing so these passed the test .
These ponytail makes we're good while they lasted but after a few days they broke. Not sure if they are returnable or not but I would like to get new ones to use .
I ordered this skirt for some club wear and some intimate activities in mind. I got the exact skirt that was pictured here so I'm not sure what others have said. The photo also does not show a hem so I was not expecting a hem. This skirt fit nice and tight and covered everything I needed it too but also made my butt look great. Great buy for the price .
This black skirt was another good wet look mini skirt. It fit me nice and snug and also stretched for maximum movement. The skirt did not ride up like other cheap client. Very good purchase I feel .
Tis move was very entertaining and better than exceed. Mark wahlberg was perfect for this role and although I do not like fake animals in movies this bear was very likable and believable .
Thoroughly enjoyed this movie, but it could have elaborated in greater detail as to the events of the situation. Haven't seen it since it was originally released .
OK, before I decided to buy these little babies, I read the reviews that were posted, but I've got to tell you that they under rated these headphones! I think these things rock! The sound quality depends on the source quality. On my Samsung SII they sound pretty good. When I'm playing music from my Dell XPS15, the audio quality is vastly improved! The bass response is WAY BETTER on the XPS vs. the SII. I love the ease with which they sync with any BT device! I wouldn't replace them with any other BT headphones, except another pair of these! I also emailed their customer service to buy another pair of silicone ear gels (since they only come with one pair each size and I wanted a spare set of the right size), and not only did I get a response in less that 24 hours, they're sending another pair of ear gels at no cost! A really good experience .
Not the highest quality sound, but it's a nice little portable speaker that's easy to use. Plenty of power, but its bass reproduction leaves something missing. But, for the cost, it's worth it .
......until I used it a second time! Then the adhesive around the clear window failed on one side. Then rain started to get to my phone, which wasn't too cool. Other than that, it was do-able. I'm 6'1" / 210 and it was a little tight getting the arm band on - and I'm not really that big in the gun department! But, it's a product I'll replace with a similar item .
I purchased 2 of these as Christmas gifts. Everyone was excited until we tried to used them. Only the TV option was available - no radio or game tabs were visible. But, the window for the TV didn't fully open either. Not a pc problem as I'm using a new Dell XPS 15z. So, they're going back .
I was very pleased at the quick shipping and the quality of the product. This was a replacement for another sport armband and I wish I'd bought this one first! Your smartphone slips in the top easily, but is secure so there's no chance its going anywhere. The only reason this didn't get 5 stars is that the arm band is fabric and it slips down if you're wearing a jacket or long sleeved shirt. But, overall, a good product and worth the cost .
They look good coming out of the package, but the crystals fall off every time you touch the case! Don't waste your money .
Yes, there is a parafoil in there, but the glare from the tri-moon obscures it! Absolutely no complaint about the advertising here .
Good short cut, to many apps, wish u didn't have to have a different app for different things that u look up .
This product is an excellent part of the Lyman Turret press.  I now own 3 of them, and once I have the dies set up for a particular caliber, I never need to reset them, I just leave them set on the turret, and switch to another turret when changing calibers.  For pistol cartridge reloads, I normally have 2 calibers set up on each turret.  Great time saver .
I personally don't think this book is nearly as comprehensive as it should be. Despite the areas the FSOT encompasses, Trivium could have done a much better job of putting a study guide together. The price they are asking is outrageous compared to the length of this book; one could finish it in an hour if need be.Not only that, there were numerous mistakes throughout. That just goes to show the lack of effort put into a &#34;study guide&#34; they expect someone to pay $35 on .
My son wouldn't take the pacifier because it was too big and gagged him. The instructions say to use for 6-8 minutes. If he's sick, he is too fussy to keep a paci in that long anyway .
I love that this product is all natural AND doesn't contain lanolin! Great alternative for people allergic to lanolin. It has a strange smell, but isn't very noticeable .
Probably the most comfortable sandal I've ever worn. This is my second pair of Tevas (I also have a pair of Hurricanes, which I love). I thought the Hurricanes were comfortable, but these Zirras are even better with their thinner straps and lighter weight. If the weather is warm, Tevas are all I wear.I hate going fishing, to the park, etc. in tennis shoes because they are too heavy, make my feet hot and I usually end up with blisters because they don't dry quickly. I need the thick, supportive soles for walking over rocks and thru water that flip flops and other sandals don't offer. Outdoor sandals are the perfect compromise, they have the support of tennis shoes with the comfort of sandals..The only complaint I have is the color is not exactly as pictured. The chocolate chip is more brown in the picture, in reality they are more of a taupe color. They are still great sandals .
My scale is off by 0.04 oz. Not a big deal for what I need it for. I like that it has an oversized surface, which I measured 4.25 inches .
uncomfortable, the seam does not allow the foot to move, the pain very pleasant soft step, very disappointed, bought as a gift to her husband .
The very first time I pulled it over the grill after the original install this thing tore with literally no effort on my part. The one that I retired never had that happen so you can't blame the grill. Grills have corners, so the cover should be durable to go over them without zipping a gapping hole. This one is about as easy as a wet paper bag to destroy. Should have bought a tarp & bungee cord .
She reminds me of Angie Stone meets Jill Scott meets India Arie. Can not stop listening!!!!! Radio doesn't do her justice .
I am in my late 60,s an avid reader but very much a new comer to e readers, we only purchased our first home computer December 2013. I  have always wanted to obtain an e reader and after much searching on my work computer  checking reviews I decided on the Kindle Paperwhite  which I and many others consider to be the best on the market, I wasn't disappointed I have only had it a short 3 weeks but now I wouldn't  be without it, after a little difficulty getting it set up (mine) its functioning perfectly its well made and looks very smart, reading now is so easy-thanks Amazon .
this cover is well made and fits my paper white perfectly would not consider having a paper white without one .
It has a nice comfortable weight and the balance is reasonable for a pen at this price. However, when writing it tends to slip from the finger hold, which means having to constantly reposition the grip. The quality of writing is mild to moderately scratchy. The flow of ink leaves much to be desired as it tends to skip although not continuously but often enough to be annoying and noticeable. I am a loyal Parker customer over the past 50 years. I acknowledge that these problems might be specific to this one pen which I purchased; however, I would rather not purchase another Parker Urban fountain pen and would be very reluctant to recommend it to some one else .
Weight and balance is fine.  The quality of writing is mildly scratchy.  Difficulty in maintaining a firm comfortable grip as the pen keeps slipping from my fingers when writing;  I therefore frequently have to reposition my grip resulting in wasted time and frustrated effort. I would not purchase another one of this pen, nor would I recommend it to another potential purchaser .
Love the ghee!  I've been using it instead of butter or oil in most of my cooking.  I've never tried another brand, but this one is great .
Good quality case at a very reasonable price!  I have no complaints and would by another Fosmon case.  It arrived faster than expected with no problems .
Had toaster 2 months, first month one side quit, second month other side quit. Don't recommend this toaster for use .
Well done Lieze this Love Restored novel is a must to read. Yes it is a love story but the novel offers you much more than just another love story. Lieze Gerber managed to sketch and reflect Rachel's life in such a way that you can relate to the day to day emotional challenges to be successful not only in your love life but also in your professional career. The detail and insight of Lieze in the novel is impressive. By reflecting the details of the variuos food types on and setting of the table, the challenges Rachel endures to establish a sustainable Architectural practise, challenges of being a single parent, the details of building renovation sites, the Monaco Grand Prix venues , the scenery in the south of France, the sailing instructions in the yacht race and then yes of course the sexual tensions between Rachel and Alain, all contributes to a wonderful read and creates a curiosity which makes you to flip to the next page. Trust me when you start reading you will not put this novel down. Well done Lieze .

Its no good its not private you could see like a clear plastic don't no what kind of anti spy private this is .
The LASER is really good and bright only dislike I have is the windage and elevation dials have a free turn does not have clicks when adjusting for the price was a great buy .
I bought this luggage for my girlfriend because she needed it to take for a year abroad as an exchange student in New Zealand.Unfortunately, yesterday, when she arrived in Auckland, for her surprise, this luggage only had one wheel left. The other three wheels never showed up. She told me she had to buy another luggage in the airport in order to proceed to the hotel and re-pack her stuff before going to her university.If the seller is interested, I can provide pictures of her luggage that she sent to me .
Great product, quality, and price. If your looking for a hdmi thats not too pricey then this is your product .
This product is amazing and I needed something for algebra since the class doesn't let you use the graphing calculators and only 4 function. The functionality is great, very light and portable, and most of all inexpensive and reliable. If your course does not let you use graphing calculators and you need a reliable four function calculator this is your product. Great shipping too .
I love these headsets very cheap and decent. Not the best but it'll do if your not a hardcore gamer. I use this for call of duty bo2 and they are amazing. Remember you get what you paid for, with that being said I feel that this product will not last very long maybe 3-6 months before you have to buy another one. So just buy it if you plan on getting a better one in the future when you can dish out $40-80 on a better one .
its a great product it worked as soon as i replaced the faulty battery so far i have no complaints .
The product itself is amazing. when you get it in the case.... Im not gonna lie for the average joe its a pretty hard case to get open even for a person technology savy. So i suggest if you get this product look up a tutorial unless on how to properly put your ipad in the case. Other than that this product is durable, protective, and reliable. Hint. try to catch this product on sale :D shipping sucked btw .
1st off it arrived ahead of its scheduled time which is a plus!2nd i love this case and the fact they give you a screen protector and and extra stuff3rd I was a bit hesitant about buying this case because it dint have a screen protector but they give you one so its a resemblance of a lighter otter box which is amazing!4th I am clumsy and dropped my phone a lot and this case seems like it will stand the chance5th its very affordable! who doesn't want that .
I couldn't put it down ! I loved the story it was written very well . Can't wait to read more from this author .
Really Poor Quality And the  color really fades really quick. Based on my experience it is a Do not purchase .
First, I really liked it, but after using less than 30 minutes it turned off and never worked again! It was SO disappointing. I have a friend who also bought one and complained that her machine broke.  Now, I am hoping that amazon will accept the idem back and return my money.  It is not expensive, but it is also not good at all!YourStory 375100 Book Binder Laminator .
John Besh is excellent. His cooking techniques are simple...but with a lot of depth. I bought all his cookbooks...you will not be disappointed .
I just received my vinyl about a week ago and I must say that the shipping was quick!! The item was well protected and it feels like butter on my stantons, I love them and would suggest this for djs who love the feel of the perfect vinyl scratch. I purchased 1 just incase i didn't like it but now i will be odering the other one with in the week .
I have a couple of these players about 1 year now. What can I say, they really took my skill level to another level and counting. The torque on this table is much to be desired but I changed the slip mats to the technics scratch mats and I use the clear light weight serato records and that makes a big difference. The Stanton slips that come with the table tend to grip the record so the release isn't as good as what a pro Dj is looking for. This table is ideal for beginners and intermediate Dj's. But as my skill improves I realize I will need to get another player with a lot more torque... But that's just my opinion .
The head shells came pretty quick. Now i have stanton tables that came with the v500 needles, when i ordered these baby's it became a brand new experience. I am a scratch dj and these needles really stand up yo the abuse, not to mention the headshells that the needles came with had the screw on weights which makes it really easy to set the counterweight on the tone arm so that one can achieve the best free record movement. The sound quality is much better than i expected and I believe can even rival the more expensive brands on the market. If you are looking for a cheaper alternative these are the needles to get .
I love it.. I don't have the other experiecnce that the other people have as regards to the fit.. i feel really comfortable when i wear mine .
This product is much better than i expected. I have mine a couple of months now and it is standing up for my home use. Its not that portable if you are looking for one to take around but it serves my purpose well. Love that i can put my serato box on the self and it is sturdy enough .
I wanted an old school flick just to wear to be different so instead of buying the earlier retro jordans or the airforce from nike i decided to buy a pair of these reeboks. They fit really well, they are really cumfy. The pump thing i don't use because i don't lace mine and i like the slack feel.They do look really great in person and i think i wana buy a second pair in a different style .
I have to keep purchasing this band because all my female friends keep asking me for it. This one was a bit small to put on but it's not noticable once on my wrist .
Anthony De Mello is one of my very favorite authors.  It's all about Love.  Love makes the world go round.  Unfortunately most human beings don't understand what Love is .
I have used these screen protectors for the past two years.  In that time, I have have had to buy three different phones for members of my family.  We have the Galaxy Note II, Galaxy S4, and now the iPhone 5s.  Each one of these phones, starting with the Note II has had one of these screen protectors on it since day one.  The Note II being the oldest phone still has on the protector from the day we got it!  It's still clear and with very little scratches on it.  The S4 is too.  This is why I purchased this packet of screen protectors for the iPhone 5s.  This brand is a much better quality than the cheap ones you buy at the grocery store, but cost the same amount of money.  Use them.  You will not be disappointed .
I just recieved my iSmooth screen protectors today and I can honestly say that these are the nicest screen protectors that I have ever bought.  They fit the screen nicely and the microfiber towel works great at cleaning the screen.  I watched the install video on my phone and then installed it in my living room 10 minutes or so after recieving the package.  It installed with very little effort and seems to be working great. One thing I'll warn about is that it doesn't fit the whole screen. It does cover the important viewable space and a little beyond. S-pen function works well as I'm writing this review with it and having no trouble .
First, I'd just like to mention that I have used this brand of screen protector before on my Samsung Galaxy Note II that I got back in December.  I enjoyed that product so much that I immediately knew which brand I was going to buy for my Galaxy S4.  That being said, I did not hesitate to use this screen protector.  I got it in the mail in two days, installed it with no hassle at all, and am enjoying the ultra clear screen protector right now as I'm tapping this review out.  I have, in the past purchased many different brands  of screen protectors for the different smart phones that I have owned and it seemed like they would get scratches in the plastic very quickly.  This brand however does an excellent job withstanding every day pocket use for my phone.  I truly am impressed with this product .
Feels great, picked it cause it was cheap, was a lit5le skeptic, installed it at a friend suspension shop, didn't want to do it alone, after installed did alignment, I did need the screws but didnt get them still it was able to get within spec, looks better the stance, on road handles good, no more bottoming out of rear end. Would recomend, never tried any of the othe brands but there cant be that much greater .
No problems after one month, easy to install great night and day view, would recomend. The hardest part was putting the wires in the interior .
The quality seem ok, the wiring its ok but i didn't use it, I placed a jumper so whe i turn the headlight it would come on. They sent me a bracket that didnt work, seems like is for pathfinder or frontier, I was told to send it back but I live abroad and it would be more expensive to send and resend. I used tie racks and its been working great .
Love this one it!! Got it for my trip and it came on time and the material is thin not heavy just perfect .
It is a great quality and good size not to big and not to small. Liked it especially for the price I paid .
I enjoy playing this app because it's easier to earn coins and it does not require me to buy then or offer me to purchase after every other spin .
I was So excited to Try this Mac Super Flashed but when I received it I was only Disappointed this Lip Gloss was very very Thick and hard to smooth it and Way to much Glitter! I will Definitely not be buying this product again .
Order it and it came in two days . A lot quicker than they said . Took ten minutes to put together and half as long to mow my lawn. So far I love it. Hit tall grass and she never slowed or stalled. Love the grass hight adjustment. Never hit any rocks or ground .
Not enough emphasis on ethical values and would have been good to  learn of the ethical review system in United States. A bit too much gratuitous violence. More on the mind games that big drug companies play would have countered this violence .
I have never written a review before, but I have to say, this book was so jumbled and boring.  What was the plot?  What happened in this book?  Nothing .
The quality on the mask I received was terrible. There was almost no nose on the mask it looked more like a cow than a horse. Will be sending mine back soon .
This book was exciting to me. A girl who never knew violence trying to make it in a new brave place while unexpectedly falling in love .
This product left a crease in my shadow at the end of the day looking oily and run together. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone especially for this price .
I really enjoyed this book couldn't put it down im looking forward to more by this author would highly recommend want to read a part two .
This book was toooo damn nasty the stuff going on just wasn't right I don't know how I got through it I could have went without reading this .
I chose this book because it received good ratings but it wasn't all that I wish I would have chosen another one but it was free .
This book was ok a slow read at first but it grew on me and then I couldn't stop reading want to read part two now .
I absolutely loved this book but I always enjoy anything by Ashley or Jaquavis I just wished they could have lived happily ever after in the end could not put it down .
It is great, the price and ease of attaching were fantastic. Followed directions from an online video as how to remove old ones and install new ones. No muss and no fuss. Shipping was prompt also. All in all a great experience. Would highly recommend to anyone. Thank you and Happy Holidaze .
Every time there is an update it doesn't update. Our show me that I can update it just tells me that I can't use it till it's updated. it's been almost a week of not being able to update. So no playing. other than that it's a good game .
The cases don't fit my phone so I'm returning them.  However, they are of nice quality.  I am disappointed because I wanted to keep them .
First book ive read from my so_love_kindle"dNo Easy Day: The Firsthand Account of the Mission That Killed Osama Bin Laden -- great read. interesting. keep me off tv .
I couldn't put this book down. Never cried so much reading!!! I loved it. Love your writing style. Keep them coming .
Good pills if you are looking for a little more indurance in a run or hitting the weights at the gym. No crazy jitters, just a longer lasting pump with less rest time .
I have always loved scramble but couldn't find people to play with. Now I can have multiple games going at once with lots of friends!  This game is the BEST! I think it is fun that I can play whenever I am ready and I don't have to wait for each move, I play when I am ready. I always have 8 or more games being played at once. Fun to play people at all different skill levels. My game and vocabulary are improving!!  It is a must-have for word game players .
Wow this was so much easier to build my dream house out on the eastern plains then paper. I had 3 of my rooms done in 1 hour. You don't have to worry about drawing start lines ether. I would really recommend this app for anyone building a house or part of a house or even remodeling .
Love this case it fits great and looks great I've dropped my phone in it a few times and nothing is broke .
This is the 2-hand hotspot and it works well in China. There is some scratches on the surface but fortunately not on the LED part .
I literally loved this product until like 6 months ago. Like it was perfect. It was kinda heavy. But after a while, the outer plastic began to warp and became distorted, and the flaps sort of just fell off. I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone .
This book was amazing. Very heartfelt. There was not a time that I wanted to put thks book down from the time I opened it .
They were on the doorstep in Australia in 5 days and fitted my clubs snuglyDefinitely a great club cover especially if you have large head clubs.Zippers are excellent quality easy to remove for the shot and even easier to replace after that great pin high shot.This is a quality product no doubt about it.  Judy .
Not much to say but loveing i have having extra studs to replace any lost pairs to earingsReally recommend these to anyone who owns earing .
I should've kept a copy of the posting due to the missing items upon receipt of product delivered. I was almost sure that the battery, charger and cables were included in the posting and none of those were included. I was very disappointed and felt I was misled by the supplier. Now I have to spend additional $$ to get it to work. Highly unlikely that I will purchase from this vendor again .
Lots of action, the perfect book if you want a book to suck you in and keep you hooked. Once you start reading be prepared to finish it you won't be able to put it down. Loved it loved it .
Nothing to say except it's an awesome tool!  In my point of view, it's superior to its competition - in all aspects .
Must-have for every DIY, as well as every professional! I never imagined these bits to be this tough until I used them .
Came broken.  Requested a return form. Never came. Button was broken and it would not charge. Horrible product right here .
I have used the better retractable fine point  pilot pens for many years. They write smoothly and fine...just the way I like it. They are also easy to hold while using. My only disappointment is that they are no longer sold in retail stores and must be ordered through the computer. Staples used to carry them and I could buy one or two at a time whereas now I must purchase them in quantities of 12....with the chance that the ink may dry up before I get to use all of them .
I bought this battery about a month ago and it worked like a charm (as advertised). It still works, but as of lately it will randomly turn off for no reason at all. It does this about four times a day. I thought it was my phone that was the problem at first, but my back up battery works just fine, and I can't think of any other reason why this would be. So I was wondering if this were a malfunctioned battery, and could possibly turn this back in for a replacement .
Works very well. But there is a little damage on the screen. And the screwdriver has no magnet, which is kinda inconvenient .
These USB charging cords did not fit the wall charger plugs I purchased for my iPhone 4. I will never purchase these items again .
I CANNOT tell you how much I enjoyed this book and WOW!WOW WOW WOW WOW!!! How I would love to have me a Daemon! SWOOOM!!!This is one of the best so far in the lux series and I must say I'm so very sad I have to wait until spring or summer for the next book. please hurry up. You rock .
Great book, couldn't stop reading  it until the end , was a riveting story line and i cannot wait for the next one .
I chose this rate because it did not come with the 6 filter that is suppose to come with. Other then that it is alright .
It's a great necklace I love it but it just wouldn't stay tighten soo I'm rating it with 4 stars .
It wouldn't stay tighten,and after just a few weeks it wore out and broke right in half.I won't be purchasing again .
Great game that's just as fun as I remember it.  It is backwards compatible and at this point the price really can't be beaten.  Even if you're not into the whole sports game, this title is a fun retro game with a great feel to it .
Even if you're not into basketball games, this one is worth a look.  Definitely not you're conventional sports game, don't expect anything too realistic.  The gameplay feels much smoother than the first, but not as overly &#34;authentic basketball&#34; as the second.  Great for all ages and at this price there's not much better out there.  Even if you only grab it for a couple Quickplay matches at a party, it's worth the money .
A must have for all xbox owners.  Definitely one of the best fighting games out there.  It easily rivals street fighter and tekken, not to mention it has more attractive female characters.  Backwards compatible on the xbox 360 as well, and at this point you just can't beat the price .
I bought this game for the original xbox too hastily.  There is another Chronicles of Riddick game for the xbox 360 that comes with this game included, only with improved graphics.  This game is also not backwards compatible with xbox 360.  Otherwise, if you own an xbox, and do not have this game, it's an absolute must buy .
After playing Mists of Pandaria through for the first time, I decided to check out this gem from Bioware.  While at times the game felt linear, the storyline was an absolute masterpiece.  With tons of combat customization options and a very KOTOR type feel with regards to story it is easy to see why this was given such high ratings when it was released.  Backwards compatible for the xbox360, and extremely cheap, theres no reason RPG fans shouldn't snatch this gem up if only just to see what they missed .
Bought this game too hastily for the PS2.  While these games are all fun classics, they're much more enjoyable with the improved graphics on the PS3.  All three games are downloadable on PSN.  Unless you're craving a retro feel or don't have a PS3, there are better ways to enjoy this game .
A console that helped revolutionized gaming.  Definitely a must-own for collectors, and worth buying used for anyone who missed out on it when it came out.  There are plenty of great titles such as Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from butcher bay, and NBA street vol. 2 that aren't backwards compatible with xbox360 and shouldn't be missed by any gamer casual or serious.  The controls (and innovative trigger buttons) feel smooth and comfortable in a way that playstation R1 and R2 buttons could not emulate.  There are certainly still merits to buying this console, if only just to see what you missed .
Comfortable socks that are great for playing just about any type of sport as well as lounging around the house.  The socks are thick enough to keep feet warm when relaxing, but the material does not constrict or overheat feet or ankles while participating in athletic activities.  Great for running, cycling, playing basketball, and even soccer training (sans shinguards .
I wasn't sure  what to expect when I ordered this book, but from the very first page my curiosity was amplified. I really enjoyed the way the author organized the flow of  the story and the tid  bits of information that constantly surprised me.  The characters  were flawless in their place within the story,  and I cannot explain how disappointed I was to find out there wasn't a second book to the series yet! This was a very fun read and I  look forward to book 2 .
Such an awesome popup book. Super vibrant and quality like the ones I remember from my childhood. I got this for my baby for Christmas so I haven't seen his reaction yet but definitely a hit with me right now .
Unless you don't want to bother going through hundreds of websites and videos to learn about this sport, the book is actually a bit more than OK .
its nice but i can't say how good or bad it is cuz i havnt had the chance to take a long ride yetsorry for the useless review .
Nothing much to say really .. its as good as any other Crocs, only it has good traction and better front protection from your average sandals .. so i like it when i go camping and even at home .. and it looks bad-ass for a Crocs .. and that the point .
Its Good an i sure l sure like it, but that only because there are no other good alternatives for my KLR 650I don't like that its bulky but i like that its well thought out as it moves around when you turn and lean your bike back and forth.the mount on the other hand is U Bolt base on the other hand is rubbish, it easily scratched when i was installing it, so now it looks as if was 4 yrs old while its brand new .. i don't get that from RAM !!All in all i satisfied .
I like that its different, the flashlight is not exceptionally good, but it does its job just fine.the switch however is a bit too easy going, as it could switch-on inside my pack .
As long as you don't over inflate it, it perfect .. on the negative side, i feel that the straps are not strong enough, but its too soon to judge as i only had it for a few weeks .
I don't mind this bag but to be honest i should've went for something with more pockets, i also would've liked if it had a zipper for front access  .. i also don't like the quality of the zippers, its too bulky and not as smooth.. and finally the Green, its nothing like the picture, its rather dull grayish green, some may like it but i sure don't.. otherwise its a decent pack .
I love it cuz its simply a good .. i have a fairly longer arm compared to my back, so usually i find it difficult to find something that fits and looks good .. this does it, and with a quality i might add .. defiantly warm although i think the omni-heat thing is a bit overrated .. but i regret not getting the one with the Hoody, it would've looked better .
Once again, i think this Omni-heat thing is over rated .. but regardless i think this base-layer is excellent .. its fairly warm, its white, and comfortable ..I say &#34;fairly warm&#34; cuz i'm a cold sensitive person .. so nothing will ever keep me warm enough .
I like it .. its as good as i thought it would be .. but the orange is too bright its almost neon orange .. i don't like that coz now it looks more like a toy than a badass survival knife, had i known i would've got the black one .
I really love it so far, but:-How long will the material last, it seems a bit thin, and the carrying bag had already lost a layer, now its more sticky !!-Its rainproof, but overnight water seem to get through the material (not the stitching),-I'm worried about the structure as overall its kind of flimsy.Having said that, i still thing its great and convenient in every way .
I had this laptop for about 3 years now, its an Asus N53J i7 .. although its a good machine, the battery sucked since day one, and after maybe a year, the battery just went dead and got useless, so i bought those Bay Valley cuz i coundt find OEM and the dealer sucks as wellPoint is that this new battery still suck, but i;m afraid its not its fault, maybe my machine was poorly designed and just consumes a lot of power (it heats a lot .
These insoles fits snuggly and gives me comfort.  I did not need time to get used to it.  So I like this product .
This sandal was recommended to me by my Physical Therapist to use at home, instead of walking barefoot.  The 3 star rating is given because I do not think it fits snuggly for comfortable walking .
I hate kick ass manga because I speed through to the end then I have to wait for the next translated installment!This happens to be supremely kick ass.I've never read anything else from this author so I have no comparison to base it on.The first omnibus started kind of slow but definitely picked up by second half.If you're reading this review for the fifth omnibus then STOP.GO BUY IT.Hope it takes you longer to finish to finish than me so your wait is not as torturously long .
The opening scenario to this series seemed really rushed.I've read the second book also.There are basically 2 stories in each book.The intro to the 2 main characters could,in my opinion,have had more back story devoted to it but instead they are thrust together in the first few pages.You shouldn't let that deter you because it definitely gets better.I love this artist's sense of humor which she even manages in to pull off in serious moments.The stories get better with each subsequent one and you can tell by the second book that she has comfortably settled into the look and feel for the main characters.I find the series refreshingly different with a sense of humor that is awesomely and appropriately self-aware and would recommend it to anyone looking for a new series to read .
Do you like dance,rock,alternative,industrial with a touch of hip hop?This band somehow manages to merge all genres of music to create one of the most kick ass albums ever.Don't ask me how.When trying to describe it I'm sure it sounds like one big cacophony of a s***storm doomed to failure.Here's proof it worked:I don't even really care for "dance" or "hip hop" and I love this album.Their new album, "How I Learned to Stop Giving a S*** and Love Mindless Self Indulgence" says it all.Seriously,GO BUY IT!You'll love it then hate yourself for not finding them sooner.All that lost time .
These decals arrived right on time (thankfully, since they were a last minute gift). They were in great condition, exactly what the info described. The decals range in size from about a foot, foot and a half long (Bruce the shark) to four by four inches (most of the single characters, like squirt and nemo). The decals are a little grainy up close, but you definitely won't notice when they are on the wall. And there are so many! my birthday friend loved them .
It has 3 scratches on face of it,was really unhappy about it.did not want to send it back cause I needed it right a way .
When I ordered the book it said a little wear and tear on the spine.  But when i received the book, the spine was ripped.  It's not the end of the world.  It's not in the worst condition but I expected better.  They still shipped it promptly.  I hoped I was helpful .
I ordered this on October 19, 2012, received it October 23, 2012, it is now November 17 and the watch has already broken off the clip so much for tough this thing could not even make it a month .
I have never like these batteries they never last that long but unfortunately you have no choice if you have a 24 volt black and Decker set.  I am sure this will be just like the other 4 batteries I have ordered it will last for about 6-8 months and then I will have to order another one .
This product got shipped to the wrong address by the shipping company at first.  Once it arrived I have been using it every day and aside for the fact that so far the espresso it make is very week, (and yes I have tried different pressures when compacting the espresso and it did not make a difference). the machine is holding up well.  It did have a slight learning curve compared to my last one.  And I do not like the fact that you can not steam the milk and make the espresso at the same time.  Other than that that it is doing its job .
This product did not work I have the Samasung Note 2 and this did not work at all. Hooked it up just like the instructions said and nothing .
the cables that are apart of this product are not user friendly.  I have already broken 2 of them and I am trying to find replacements on line and it is imposiable .
I am coming up on my warranty running out and I am afraid that these will not last much longer. I have had to return this item twice for malfunction. The first time they stopped working because of sweet, which I do a lot when I run. The second time sweet and the band on the back broke. You would think that sweet would be a problem that these things could handle but I am telling you if you are a person that sweets a lot stay away from these .
What do you expect from a helmet, apart from looking cool and being airy of course? If the protection of your skull is anything to go by, I will vouch for this little guy! I was involved in a bike crash two days ago - had a minor concussion (so don't remember what happened) and landed up in hospital with bruises and abrasions all over the right side of my body. Recovering the helmet from the police office today, however, revealed how lucky I had been - the concussion had clearly happened because I had hit the right side of my head read hard on the concrete. The helmet is absolutely cracked into two pieces in three different places on the right side - but there's NOT A SINGLE SCRATCH on my head. I don't even feel that I struck my head anywhere (except for the initial grogginess I experienced due to the concussion) even though the force of impact clearly was enough to break this tough helmet into pieces. I was travelling at 20 mph when I crashed (in case anybody thought that it was a passive crash) - this helmet really soaked up the impact and basically saved everything that I had - an impact that can crush the helmet could definitely have crushed the skull without it .
The axle is not at all as projected on the amazon page - it is missing the the hub covers shown attached o the cone in the picture. Not exactly useful for me without them, have to salvage them from the old axle .
As described, clear and works well. Doesn't have a clip and hence is difficult to fit onto a screen though .
MISLEADI thought you would be able to get the amazon books on this reader I was very disappointed.Would not recommend .
I enjoyed this book dispute the several left out or typing errors. It needed to be proof read better.I have wondered if my grandmother still lives in her house, and I have lived with several ghosts myself, but never able to see them, but knew of their presence.Melodie Smith DavisGingerquilters@hotmail.com .
I really love this app I am on it every day it brings out the kid in me. I am very disappointed because for a month or so I have seen coming soon on my XP and goals... I would really like to know that the game will be moving fwd soon... I'm not sure I can keep interest just feeding animals and collecting the goods for much longer. I no longer have goals for ugg and I only have one goal for gran please please move the game fwd soon .
I like the game i don't think that we should pay for the second one.. i think that the game is fun but the name of the princess is a big issue .
I have not stoped playing since I got it, though I really don't have much time lol... I gave it 4 stars only because I feel higher payout for the events would make it a better play... but if you don't have time and can play over and over the same l l like me this is it.... I'm sure soon I'll put the in app purchase to use so I can dominate the net and game lol .
This book is truly a great read.  I could not put it down.  Each character is vivid and relatable.  Everyone will have a character that just speaks to them.  I hope we get to find out more about Billie in the future .
This product hasn't worked since the day i got it in the mail, and ive tried everything the product recomends doing. it says its fully charged and then wont charge my fone for more than about half a minuet wen i switch it on. i might have just gotten a faulty fluked product, but im not sure becus i dont know how to return it or ask for a refund or a new product.  For i didnt see that info anywhere if i recieved one and it worked id happily right a different review though .
Works ok it won't fit on iPod docks without a little mod. Doesn't fit like the otter box for my iPhone the silicone cover on the iPod otter box fits loosely .
Love it ,  only two things that it doesn't do is , color and wolirless printing .  Very happy though .
I get compliments on how people love my color.  I most like the size .  Not to big !  Very happy with this purchase .
Excellent! I could not put it down. I usually do not read fiction, because it rarely keeps my attention. Not Guilty kept me glued to the pages .
The hat sent to me was not the hat in the photo- no brass rivets, only dots of gold paint .
This device does not work atall. Do not buy.it is just waste of money and time.Garmin should take this out of the market .
I purchase this software, due to the writing requirement as a graduate student. Although this is the old version of Microsoft Office University 2010, the new version 365 University 2010 requires subscription and only load on 1 pc while this product requires no subscription and loads on 2 pc or laptop. Gaining the product key was fast and easy, ensure to use a college email that ends with .edu. This program has the same software installation as 365 .
The case fits my tablet perfect and stand freestyle as displayed in the picture. Only problem is that the case is left open when charging and the free pen is no good use .
It locks in place.My son wasn't a fan but my daughter who is pretty picky liked it a lot! It took a while to get here for 1 of them and the other one was quicker(maybe because they were different colors .
Hi,I bought this product so my son and I could start learning to play an instrument. I like it very much. Th only thing I would change about it is the volume. It doesn't seem to reach a high volume and in noisy places you won't hear it well.I also wish you sold it with a pedal even if the price went up so you could fade or extend the notes.Other than that I love the product! I received this shipment the quickest of all my products! I think 3 days if that! Thank you so much!Oh! By the way, your earphones come with an adapter so they will fit your piano. That was thoughtful .
In this brand of printer if 1 cartridge doesn't give everything is null, scanner fax and printer and the ink is not cheap I pop these babies in give it a cleaning and I'm set to go. Thank you so much! Received them in 3 days...quick .
not too hard not to easy.... mind worker for sure. its a pretty fun game to play. my husband is much better than I .
These are plastic and the clips break off easily.  I also don't like the rubber tips, they stick on the screens and don't slide very well at all.  I gave it 2 stars because you get what you pay for.  I would give 1 star but they are very inexpensive .
Excellent fit. Very easy to install and would recommend to anyone.  No difference between this and the one that the washer came with .
No problems the battery works good so far .
The case is nice and does the job but not as good as the one I had for my S3.  This one is harder to get the phone in and out and always moves my belt so my belt buckle is always to one side and needing adjustment constantly .
I am hooked on this show and I can't decide which leading man is hotter! This one is worth every minute .
They're never as in depth as the books but this series is still awesome! I am excited to see the final one .
Not particularly exciting but great great movie that will go down as a classic. Great story, great acting. This is a tear jerker too .
Now you can know the perfect prayer for every situation because each prayer is what God has declared to be His will.  Now we can pray God's will, not our will.  Worth far more than the price .
I love John Denver, I never knew about this album so I was glad to see it and get it.  This man is a classic in my books .
They are still in the package so I'm really not sure The color and pattern are nice, I used it as a gift .
This is the best product for inflammation that I have ever used.  I recommend it to all of my friends and will continue to repeat order.  If you don't have this producat and you have inflammation then you need it .
Great book but if you have to take ar quizzes then don't read this book they dont have it that kinda stinks .
I was looking for a rower for our home gym that was reasonably priced. I have used the Concept 2 rowing machine at workout facilities, but the price was a bit above our budget. So, I did some research and the product write-up of the Phoenix 98900 rower along with the price seemed like a good fit for our needs. The product came packaged ok, no complaints there. Assembly was easy, I had my son assist me and he enjoyed putting it together with me. When it was time to try it, I thought I was operating a meat slicer at a deli! The flywheel seems to be rubbing on something inside the casing. I tried to find the source of the noise, to see where it was making contact and couldn't resolve the issue. One of the reasons I purchased this rower was the fact that it uses magnetic resistance, but it sounds like it is more of a flywheel with a braking system. It sounds like a car driving down the street with work brake pads. I am not satisfied with the product. I would have been better off saving up for a better product .
The book arrived in an appropriate amount of time. The quality of the book is efficient. It's not by any means the best &#34;litterature&#34; but it serves the purpose and an informatory guide for the general public eye .
The movie would have been great except for one thing, why in the world was President Obama included in it? THAT RUINED THE ENTIRE MOVIE! Honestly, if I could get my money back I would!Why wasn't I warned .
Couldn't believe how addicting this game was!  My boyfriend wouldn't put it down and chose logo quiz over his new halo4 videogame last night. I was shocked. Now I have a new hurdle to overcome when I go to his place- thanks a lot logo quiz &gt .
I don't write reviews so often but I had to do it for this case. It is a very nice case, and it fits perfectly on my nexus 5 and so far it has kept my phone protected from breaking apart when dropping it by accident. I do recommend it .
its an ok game true only thing about it that I don't like is u can't move shyts week but I b getting hella headshots .
Replacement was decanter fits perfectly. The best part of the entire thing is that the old decanter would spill when pouring. They must have redesigned the lid no more mess. So this was an upgrade over the other coffee pot .
The only thing I can say about this cover is that it's cute....When I try taking it off I have to have another person help me and use a screwdriver.  Not worth it .
feel lucky found this gadget, price is way below from original one.2 GB VGA dedicated, 8 GB RAM, back-lit keyboard, bass sound, this is what i looking for..i just received it on time with no bad result.ivy bridge i7 processor, can hold up until 32 GB. and i already purchased and replace with 16 GB RAM, and it works like a rocket. tomorrow i'm will change to SSD from crucial also.you can imagine what the result gonna be..thanks for the good service..recommended to everyone .
I needed some laughs and an easy read when I couldn't sleep. This fit the bill. I giggled pretty hard a few times, but also found myself getting bored and speed reading in a couple spots. I wouldn't suggest paying full price, but don't skip the read entirely, either .
I like putting this on my golf glove. Keeps scoring easy.  I do,keep a watchful eye on it but it has not slipped off yet .
Love this book....couldn't put it down, I've been able to learn so much about myself and even my friends. The effort put forth to produce this amazing book should not go unappreciated .
The knife came fairly sharp, it has great ergonomics, the handle is very grippy, but the sheath is a joke.  I sanded off all the "protective finish".  Please, the only reason a primal tool is painted is to conceal defects (knife steel can be blued, but should otherwise be oiled or waxed). I sanded the finger grooves to seamlessly fit up with the grips.  I also sharpened to "micro convex edge" and it is now sharp.  The blade is more than adequate for building temporary shelter.  I do not "baton" as this is actually latin for, "I forgot my hatchet/axe".  If I see another 20-something furiously whacking, slashing, banging, and otherwise pretending to be an Alaskan/Yukon/Outback trapper (while the traffic from the freeway cuts into the commentary), I think I will dirty me diapers.  The sheath is made out of "genuine imitation ballistic Nylon".  It is what I would call, "Ballistic Bedsheet".  You can't tear it, but if you accidentally cut it, you can rip it right off.  This is what I did, and it revealed the sheath's only real saving grace--a heavy plastic molded sheath/guard underneath that can be easily Kydexed.  If you are careful with the original sheath, it should last a long time.  But if you rip off the "Ballistic Bedsheet" and cover the molded plastic guard with Kydex, it will be indestructible, without being outlandishly humongous.  One last thought--a smaller knife, plus a folding saw is much more realistic and probably faster way to build shelter. Yes, I would buy it again.  But, kiddees, quit with the batoning, already .
I received this system today only to be greeted by what was clearly a returned item. The box seal had already been broken, the box was damaged, and the bags that were used to wrap the units inside were torn and opened. The system itself looked ok and free from damage. When I plugged it in it sounded good for about .003 seconds, and then the subwoofers stopped working. The speakers were playing but no bass from the woofers was coming out. I tried the different inputs on it to see if it was my computer, but it failed to play with my pc, phone, and SD card. I could already tell this was a returned item but still had some hope it would work. Instead of bothering with the factory, I'm going to send this back to amazon since I received used defective goods rather than new. I'll do an update on this when the hopefully "new" system gets here.I got the new one a few days ago, when I opened the shipping box and saw that the product box also had the original seal broken and replaced I figured it was going to be the same deal all over again. But to my surprise the speakers work just fine. So maybe the factory had to unseal and reseal all the boxes for some reason? Let's hope it was because they forgot to put the remote in, which by the way is pretty useless since it doesn't seem to work when you're more than 5 feet away from the system and has to be directly pointing at it. I have it under my desk so it's no big deal since I can just use the buttons on the system. The speakers themselves sound nice, the subs are loud and make a nice boom. It's a bit overpriced but it makes a nice display.I'm giving it a 3 star from the original 1 star review for the hassle and the seals on the box .
I enjoy the shoe. I can put it on and there is no break in time,I can wear them all day .
Love this game. You can keep playing and it never gets dull. Works great on kindle fire. Highly recommended!  Try it, you will like it .
A beautiful story of loss,longing,regret and redemption.I fell in love with Harold Fry and could not put down this book. Simply and beautifully written, it is moving,poignant,and a brilliant study of human relationships and how the unspoken moments can tear people apart .
the smell is clean and not over powering and is not a cheap smell everyone should try it. Love it .
Fits compact and sub compacts perfectly very concaeble. I have carried my xds every where in it. Never had any issues .
I chose this rating due to a few issues. 1 There are a few issues with charging, my phone shows that it gets disconnected while charging. 2 the rubberized finish started to wear off after 1 day in my pocket. 3 The battery from the case only extends my phones power for a few hours not the 20 or something described in all the information I have seen. As far as the stun gun has not had to use it yet .
I usually watch on PBS and nice to see old episodes and ones I missed.  The sexual tension between Doc Martin and Louisa is very enjoyable and the other characters add to the program's enjoyment.  Thanks for offering and I will continue to watch later seasons.  I recommend.  I like Martin's no nonsense approach to patients, somewhat like my several doctor's manners, though probably not to his extreme.  His facial expressions are priceless and Louisa is a joy to watch .
The last product I ordered from the company came in promptly and with no damage.  The case and cover art were well kept and the disk had few to no scratches .
i put this item on my car march 2013 it is now December 2013. so its been 9 months an these license plate covers are completely rusted and look terrible. I would really not like to even give 1 star. Id seriously like my money back but i doubt that's possible .
A wonderful story about what all of us have and never use wisely or even think about until it's too late .
Well, it does what it says it does at least.  It WILL hold your hairstyle in place throughout your day.  But not before taking whatever hair-doo you've spent an hour perfecting and flattening it down into a boring, lifeless mat of hair that's naught but a shell of what you saw in the mirror a minute ago .
Couldn't put this book down! The entire series is amazing!! Characters and story line are great and the books just flow right into one another .
This series is amazing I couldn't put them down. No disappointment here. Everyone should read this series. They'll love it .
Great game when I was finished  I could not stop playing it over and over until my game died  then I played it on The charger .
Awesome and Amazing I'm not an expert but I say that this game is almost perfect the way it is .
Looks like a lovely pink case but I have yet to receive my case. Disappointed that I never got it .
excellent image, 1 year and is working ok , the 3d is awsome, the remote control is not good on the buttons but i use other .
My Nokia Lumia 920 is my constant companion returned a year ago to buy it on Amazon and the experience has been superb, WP 8 each day grows more and more, there are no top app that are in the store, and the camera with the photos at night is unsurpassed .
The laptop its self seems to be a good computer for my needs. However I have had difficulty with windows 8, and not being able to easily download programs or install them .
So the shoes are sorta sleek and small, not bulky at all.  Fabric seemed sorta flimsy and cheap when they arrived...however once I put them on....OMG, so nice.  The sole honestly feels like you are walking on a 4" piece of foam....these shoes are very quiet as well....I was walking throughout the main level of my home and normally can hear myself walking, in these shoes I was as quiet as a ninja.  Perfect shoe to wear on a Spring / Fall day with a pair of jeans and a hoodie or T shirt.  I've already ordered 4 more pair for when these run out (I can tell they will...I'm rough on shoes and paid like $35 on amazon...get what you pay for .
this chain broke the first time I tried putting it on didn't even get it hooked!!!!! &#34;junk&#34; but that's what one gets at junk price .
Very nice, they look great and she loves them wears them everywhere can't tell them from the real ones! just as advertised .
This is a very nice case and looks great on my I phone, but it didn't have the stylus pen or the screen protector as advertised, :- .
I bought this for my 3 year old daughter, it was good for the price and she loves it. It's now were she puts her special things and we didn't even guide her in what she would put in it. The storage area is small though and the ballerina doesn't always stop spinning once the lid is shut so the mirror is scratched from that .
First off, I didn't receive the item that I ordered. Instead, I got some no name cheap, Chinese knock-off. On a full charge, it only works for about 20 minutes on standby and only records in two minute increments during that time. The instructions are a waste of paper! I had to go onYouTube and find a video that explains how to use it. Complete waste of my time and money! Be smart and trust the reviews .
Despite its price (80 bucks with shipping is steep, imo, for a knife), this is an unregrettable choice.It came quickly, and in great shape. I think it came with a warranty of some sort, but I doubt imma need to use it.Now coming to the knifing. It's exactly as you would expect, the perfect choice for chopping veggies. Quick, sharp and pain free. I wouldn't go chopping avocado seeds with it, just 'cause you'd blunt its edge, but for most daily veggies and meats, you can't beat this knife. I suspect I might end up buying a lot more in this range .
This pan is perfect to make home made pizzas. The crust doesn't stick to the base, its size is perfect, and it looks really good.One possible minus, and this might just be an inevitability, is that it's a bit hard to clean, and the bottom gets easily discolored in the oven. That isn't part of its utility though, and I don't reckon it's actually affecting the longevity either, so 'm still giving it a perfect score. It's a good buy, and I think I might get myself another .
I picked this up on a whim at the grocer one day, totally prepared for a backup meal, in case I did, as I suspected I would, muck up the crust. Surprisingly though, with very little effort, this turned out to be a fantastic little pizza.I tend to spread it thin, so I use a 14 inch tray, though not quite filling it. It takes about ten minutes of kneading before its nice and springy and ready to be laid out.Totally non-soggy, VERY tasty, and holds a large number of toppings very well. I would thoroughly recommend it. I suspect the 24 pack will save you a chunk of change, but I mostly got it 'cause I'd always have a backup meal, for when I felt enterprising in the kitchen .
Initially, I considered giving this five stars, because it is compact, neat and holds a decent number of ties (I had over twenty on it and still had some empty slots).However, and I don't know if this only happened to me, but it started to fall apart in a few months. When I first hooked it up, I noticed that the connection between the twirling base and the hook top was loose, at best, and the plastic that connected them wasn't particularly impressive, but I thought nothing of it. After regular use though, the base began to start falling off, and each time it fell, the subsequent re-connection felt weaker and weaker.It only cost me a dollar though (with shipping) and came from Hong Kong, so I figured it was probably not worth it to pursue the issue of workmanship.Would I buy it again? Probably, but I expect if I do, it won't be my last one .
Amazon manages to, somehow, have the best prices on most of its products.The shampoo's great in quality, good for the hair.It shipped soon (with Prime), came in good condition, and was a great bargain. So no complaints .
Anyone who's ever had trouble with self-timer photography, or anyone who's even ever just worried about a shaky hand will find this product to be a God sent. It's half the price of the Nikon brand version, comes with its own neat little carry pouch, has little to no instructions required, and is up and running in seconds.Its cross-product compatibility is also a neat feature, so that if you upgrade your camera in the future (as most people are won't to do), chances are you won't need to change it (especially if you stay with the Nikon family).I haven't had a chance to test the battery life yet, but it's got one of those standard flat round ones, and I think it should last a while .
Quick shipment, neat package.Pros:Both a brush and a silicon end, to get in and clean out the grime, and then dust it offSleek and streamlinedCap fits on both ends, so the chances of losing it are minimizedCons:The button for retracting the brush feels flimsy. I am just overly ginger with it, to make sure I don't break itBut you need to realize this is just a tool. Cleaning between keys is still a chore, and it's still going to take a while .
I was diffident about making this purchase, considering some of the negative reviews about the so called &#34;new Pyrex&#34; and its propensity for breakage, or as some people so graphically described it, explosions. Eventually though, it was the competitive price point, the covers, the sizes, and of course, the brand that made me risk it.And I'm glad I did. I've been using it for a solid month or so now, and pretty frequently at that. No breakage, no damage, no cracking, no overheating, no destroyed meals or lacerated body parts. Just good, evenly heated, food. And a nice looking cooking utensil.About the covers not fitting, again, something I did not experience. Maybe I got lucky, I like to hope that happens some times, but if my experience were any indication, it might be worth taking the risk. Shipped quickly and in perfect condition.P.S: I hope I haven't jinxed it .
Pros:Thin, doesn't add bulk to the MacKeeps the Mac scratch freeTranslucentPrettyCons:Fingerprints need to be frequently cleanedUpdate (6/6):Six months in, the age has begun to show. Fingerprints get harder to clean, and it looks a little shabby. Still usable though, but not quite as enthusiastically usable .
I bought this phone after looking at all the reviews, and planned to use it across two rooms in my apartment. Unfortunately, the range wasn't very good. I live in a house with concrete walls, and the reception in the room adjacent to the one with the base unit is terrible and crackly. I tried the range extender, but couldn't set it up, despite it being compatible according to the manual. So I guess if you want to use it in one room that isn't too big, or maybe have thin walls (I don't know, but I guess the thick walls do play a part), then this is the phone for you.The answering machine and caller ID etc. are predictably Panasonic standard, i.e., great .
So, it took me a while to get these, but the customer service guys were great about it, so I would actually give them an extra star for that. They re-shipped it with a better service almost immediately, and this time it got delivered. They had a special on, so I got a free one as well, and overall I would say it was a great deal.About this quality: it's quite fantastic. I use the big one for my computer, and the little one for my tablet, and have no complaints yet. They keep my devices clean and have lasted well, these last couple of months. I would definitely recommend purchasing this .
This book was a real joy to read. Hard, real and non stop. Stallings has created a character that is easy to love. A great thriller that won't let you down .
It was a great price and deal. The keyboard doesn't quite match up to my mac pro key board. You also can not see the back lit keys. But it has kept my keys clean and in great condition .
This is a great can't put it down page tuner and well written mystery/thriller. Very fast paced story with surprising twists and turns. I would recommend this book to anyone who's into a great read .
A fast paced story well worth the read and hard to put down! An ABSOLUTELY believable set of events based on the headlines and tensions in the world today. Fanatical terrorists bent on the destruction of the free world in order to impose their own way of life upon everyone who is not a " TRUE BELIEVER .
This story was told in the first person by the two main characters. Important points in the book were first revealed by one person then word for word rehashed in first person by the second main character. This made the storyline slow down and the book longer than it needed to be. It was all I could do to finish it. I will not continue reading this trilogy .
A great combination of many legends from the histories of the civilizations of our own past with believable characters.The BOOK 1 of this 2 part series should be read first, as it would be hard to follow the storyline of BOOK 2 if you haven't already read BOOK 1 .
First, I recieved a free copy for my review. i would have paid for this wounderful story! Once again Mr Barnes has writen a first rate story with very believable charectors. Buy it, you will not be dissapointed .
This story is very well written and ABSOLUTELY worth reading.I recommend this book to anyone who wants or has a tattoo!Just remember, it is a horror story, but...well....you just never know .
I chose this rating because of the great surprise ending!Not a slow moment in the whole story!I would recommend this book and author to anyone who's an action/suspense reader.Great read .
I have just finished reading the book The Hunting Tree Trilogy(Books 1-3) by Ike Hamill. I enjoyed it's blend of oral history of Native American people, the biblical story of the garden of Eden (no spoilers here!) and the story of good verses evil. I would recommend this book, only 4 stars because the shifts between characters and time lines may be hard to follow,overall a great read .
bought these at a price of 47.87 exlc. free ship(i'm a prime) and taxpeople may say these are a bit overpriced but this pair of sneaker is simply classic! its comfortable(i'm a size 10, medium in width) no pains at all when running with fashion sneakers (which is rare!) and one more thing, ITS LACES DOESN'T UNTIE ITSELF EASILY, UNLIKE MY ADIDAS ORIGINALS SAMBASoverall, if you're looking for vintage style, i recommend onitsuka tiger mexico 66s .
to be honest i have never expected such quality at this price and so far  i really enjoy my time cooking with this pan, however, its center is not its bottom, so it is a bit hard for me to cook  when applying oil on the pan .
i'm not going to talk much about this product, but i can tell you out of 4 tubs of whey from ON, all of them tasted badly, they give results yes, i endured 3 of them, but this particular flavored crossed the line, gave it away for $10 after 2 servingsP.S. I'm a fan of vanilla and i always ask for vanilla ice cream in any ice cream shoppes .
i like the results it gave me and it is also very refreshing(not in the taste of the milk!) because your muscles didn't feel very much sore after drinking this after a heavy workout, but I'm going to tell you this: DO NOT BUY THE STRAWBERRY FLAVORED ONE, it barely tastes like strawberry and it smells really bad, gonna try vanilla next time .
Great! absolutely amazing! unlike most sackpacks this has a clipping on its straps that makes sure that your sackpack will not fall! very roomy as well .
Hacking...who would have thought of that!? The moment I watched its e3 trailer about 2 years ago, it struck my heart to buy it since I am also a total assassin's creed fanboy.Bought it, I like it but some noticeable but tolerable flaws though.  The story was known to be super sloppy and the characters are too inconsistent. Driving is insanely hard if you are used to GTA V's franklin special ability, but you'll get over it real soon by Act 3, assuming if you are playing it consistently and not resuming to play it after a month. gunfights are totally GTA V but again I think its mechanics are the staple of the free-roaming games. Lots of hacking, so many ways to do it and so many ways to use it. If you're a fan of intense games like me,you'll like it, much more heart-wrenching than any of assassin;s creed games while also insanely harder than AC and GTA. There are no stealth missions that I could get through without at least killing 5 guys (or maybe I get frustrated too easily/I'm a psychomaniac/I suck at gaming).Overall, if you really had some crazy a** expectations for this game, you are likely to be disappointed, but hey, try to play it through before you post a review because I was thinking of putting a 2 stars here if I'm reviewing this after only 5 minutes of gameplay. Storywise, it can't match its sister-product assassin's creed but this game sure puts you into a lot of adrenaline and I'm telling you this, there are about 3 villains here that you really wanna strangle in real-life due to their attitudes/personality (something like Vieri de Pazzi in AC2, man I still wanna kick that guy in the nuts)why I mentioned The Last of Us? because imo it is the best game ever made and I hope Sony will approve naughty dogs to release it in other platforms so that other gamers could enjoy it. Had the same hopes for this too, but too bad its story is super-crappyBuy it, Hack on........awesome_user_logoff .
I've totally thrashed mine to pieces after I watch that kaepenick commercial, I don't support products that vilify my city and its people. what's up with depicting seahawks fans as anarchists wrecking down buses and stuff? seriously, and these are way too overpriced, originally i wanted to give em 2 stars, but that ad made me so angry that i contacted customer service whether i can give a negative star. If you're from seattle, you know what I mean .
Great read the author was on point with this book. I am still wondering about the three way relationship...I don't think it will last...ready to read part two .
This book had me crazy. Fallon was my girl until this book. I mean really y do her character like that. It ended good and there should not be a three. Great read .
It was good from beginning to end. I hated it ended. Ready for two. Glad I don't have to wait long .
Great read..could not put it down..so ready for part two..you want b disappointed..a pager turner all the way..loved it great .
This was a great follow up to the first one. It was better than the first.  The men I just love them. Cue he just I don't know, problems. Keisha is my girl. Great ending to this loved it .
It was good. .a little shory but still good. I was not expecting that ending at all..hoping in 3 that there will be a twist and all my questions get answered to many left unanswered .
It was great. I was expecting some things to come clear early. I was not expecting that ending. I wanted Olivia to know everything. Mark I knew he was go click. Zoe and Dillion are my fave, just crazy. Love them. The people from the past should have stayed in the past away from Zay n Dillion. I guess it's time for Dillion to find out something, waiting on part three like right now .
That was the best book. I enjoyed from beginning to end. This is my third book by this author and I must say she never disappoints. Fantastic read .
It is a pretty case but the rubber part does not fit tightly around the hard part. It keeps coming loose making the back bulk out .
I loved this book..it was great. A must read! I can not wait to read part two. Go ahead Tiece .
Wwhat a great read. I enjoyed it. I can not wait for two. This dude Malik is beyond crazy.  I am glad this is being addressed because so many women go thru this .
I just knew this part would not disappoint like the first one.  It was so good. I love Tisha and Dime together. Tisha need someone to care for her n have her back. Great read...can't wait til day next part .
This book was amazing. Just as the whole series. Yyass The author always amazes me.  It had u on the edge of yous sit. I was fussing at the book. I wanted to jump in and slap people. It was an emotional rollercoaster. I loved it. I can not wait till 4 comes out .
Are you serious? How can someone end a book like that? So many secrets..dang something should have been shared. Y send Jade thew so much to have her to go threw it again with finding out about her friend n man. Patience she getting on my nerves. What is the secret Real got? Hope part two is coming out like now cos one didn't give no answers. Plus, it needs to be longer .
We all know that this series is the bomb!!!! Enough said that is all can't wait till da next season .
This book should have not been written. Part 1 was great but two was rushed and it was da same things to happen over again..part one ended on a good note and it should have ended there...do not think I will be buying three .
This book was soooo good. The best. The drama was on point soooo good. It is worth the read. I still love Cherokee but she did piss me off...the otha girls Koree n Lavish were great great additions to the book...I am impatiently waiting on three...can't wait .
That was a good follow up from one. I like Jabari. I hope him and Liyah will work it out. I am just shocked about Kelisha, didn't know she was like that. She needs her a man, maybe Andre. Amanda needs to get a backbone. Waiting on three .
The book was good. I just don't like the jump in time..from it being Monday to two months to two years. I thought this was the last of this series but I thought wrong.  Mykell n Reniece have too much going on..I wan them to b happy n dats it..that ending was not expecting that cos Mykell made me angry....it was good .
I am speechless that was SO good. BIRD is getting on my nerves. She need to see what was is over. Dee needs to grow up. Kenya I don't know..they hold stuff in to long n get caught up...but I loved it. I can not wait til the next one .
Great read. This was good from beginning to end. I can't wait til part two drops. That ending didn't expect it .
I have to admit I was not gonna buy this part but I did. I am glad I did because it was better than three. I still feel like this book should have ended at one. So, I guess I will wait till the next one..hopefully it ends on a good note and the final to this series .
Good but very short. I wasn't expecting it to be short but  figured out the story early on. It is some dumb ppl who fall head over heels .
I cannot wait till all if these drop. I don't like snippets because they get u all in your feelings and wanting more. These were good cannot wait .
This was just entirely to short. When it gets good it is ending...really....not happy about that..needed to b longer...I would have paid more if I had more .
What an ending! This book was great. I do not want to give nothing away but it is a must read. I can not wait til part two .
It was short and I wanted more because it was just getting good. I am waiting on two. I can't wait to see what happens to that Sasha.....friends are your worst enemies sometimes .
This book had me confused on some parts like it was rushed. It was good both parts I can not wait till three .
This book was good. I enjoyed from beginning to end. That Justin is something serious. I am not go spoil it for anyone. So, I am go simply say just read it and thank me later .
What a great ending to a series. That was good all the way through. I will not spoil it for anyone but it is a must read. Loved it .
What can say about this Author? She is fannnntastic! That is what I can say. I have been anticipating this book for a minute . She did not do me wrong. The suspense was just overwhelming. I mean it was the best. That ending!!!!!!! OMG!!!!! I guess I will wait for part four but I am a little impatient....loved it .
Okay where do I start. I mean this story was riveting from beginning to end. I mean the author know s how to get you hyped. I mean it was entertaining on every page. It was the best. I must say good job. I can not wait till part four .
Yes, this book was all that. I loved it. But Lisa is working my nerves in this book. Mari I can't even speak on her, she a friend then she go behind her friend back. Waiting on the next one .
This author never disappoints me. This was a fantastic read. It was something different. That is why I like this author, her mind is all over the place. Loved it. Cannot wait til her next book drops .
This was all that and more. I thought this was the end of the series but I guess not. I will be waiting on 6. I mean u cannot leave a cliffhanger like that .
This book was oh my I mean it was good from beginning to end. I am rooting for Kaiah and Deonte. I like them  as a couple. That ending was something else. Can't wait for part two and I hope it isn't to long of a wait .
I liked the book. I wasn't expecting certain things to happen in this book. I don't like how Ant is now a schizophrenic. I mean really. That I don't like. I mean y hide we all know ppl after them so just reveal yourself to your family. I didn't see the point in how it ended. It was a great read. I will be getting three .
A Great series. These women are just stupid all the way around. What is wrong with them. Vic and Triecy are just helpless. Triecy keep doing stupid shot. If she don't want him just leave him. Vic is beyond low. Really now you want to b an addict really. I cannot wait till the finale come. I hope they get their ish together .
It had me confused. It was all over the place. To read all that and it end like that. I didn't think this was a well thought out book .
My girl Sunny you are great at what you do. I enjoy reading  everything you put out. Everything you pin, I know it's good and I don't hesitate to get it and read it. This book is another addition to how good your pin game is. I loved it from the beginning to the end. Great story lines. Most importantly, it ended on a good note. Sometimes reading a series is just to much because of the wait but this was just how I like it all in one book. I cannot wait till the next book drops. Keep doing you and keep that pin going .
BUGATTI IS A MESS.  This was a great story. I enjoyed it. These women are a mess in this o e. Crazy is not the right word. Poor Tabitha, she really loves that Bugatti. He needs to get it together or let her go. So much drama in this one so I know part two will have way more .
Well, I must say that this book was definitely a page turner. It did jump through the months and years fast but it was great. The characters were well put together. I liked them all. Wondering is there a part two because it can not just end like that. #teamtrentandamore .
THIS book was exciting from the first page til the end. Carina makes my head hurt, my feet, my back, just everything. I love some Q, I hope him and Diamond work it out. Poor Jazzy, she about to start something. I thought Dontay was so great for Jazzy and now he got skeletons. I cannot wait til part three drops .
It is slow. Not much action. It just didn't really hold my attention. It's so much need to be told. There are a lot of secrets. It was an okay read .
What isn't with the women in this book? I mean enough is enough. They always running off and not finding out the truth.  They just come up with their own conclusions. Kaiah, I mean she needs to step back and look at what she do and grow up. It's okay to be hot headed but not 24/7. Deontae, I like him he is good for Kaiah. What is Carlos problem? My boy Deontae cannot go out like this. And why is Sharae even there? That ending, I mean really if that happen why ole boy ain't on the tape. All in all it was a good read. Just want these women to grow up and stop letting nonsense come in between them and their men. Kinda hoping for Orlando to stay in the picture .
This was a great read. It was something different from the drug dealings and the cheating and fighting. I enjoyed it. Keep it up Sunny, you never disappoint .
How can I put this. This book was awesome. I mean every page it was excitement. Abe is my man. All the twists and turns and secrets, had me on edge. I cannot wait fir part two to drop. I am ready to see how all the secrets are going to unfold. Great job .
That was the best follow up to a book. I mean it was great. I felt so bad for my boy Fatz. It just wasn't right. He had me rolling. Once again that Kenji, he is that man. I cannot wait till the next one drop.oh I am so glad Clive getting some play. And will Knox get a soft spot for a change. Great read .
This was the best. I mean Kenji, I can't get enough of him. Poor Ava, I want them together. Let's see how this unfolds in part two .
This is how you end a series. It was excitement all the way through. All kinds of drama. I loved it. I am glad all the secrets came out. Cone on Diamond can't be dat conniving and get away with it.LAWRENCE cannot be blinded by love. This book was fiyah .
GREAT FOLLOW UP FROM PART ONE.  That Diva is something else. I am tired of her and Eddie's relationship. Why she keep taking him back? I love Major. I also like Barkheem. MEL and meeka are a hot mess. I love the friendship that Diva and Hershey have, great to see that bond. Diva needs to decide who she want because she go get caught up after awhile..love the book cannot wait for three to drop .
This was a great read. It was short. I wanted to keep on reading. Now, I am waiting on part two. Kaseam is such a nice young man. Major is a major creep. I hope he get what he deserves. Why Andrew tho. He was a big part of them and he needed to had stayed with Kaseam and not left like that. I didn't like that cos Kaseam go need some help to take down Major, phenonical is not go be enough to help him. I guess we go see when two drops .
This part was definitely a banger. So much excitement. I was wondering what GO happen next. Usually, you can figure it out before it happens but not this one. I am glad that some questions are about to get answered. I am glad that these women are seeing each other now. I was shocked about Kendall. I cannot wait till three drops .
Now this that fiyah work right here. This was a great read. A page turner at its best. I just loved the payback. Fantastic. Can't wait for part two .
Great read. So much drama and death. I did not think that darn near everyone was going to die. It was good nonetheless. I guess Cherokee got an okay ending .
When I say this was a page turner it definitely was. I was not expecting all the twists and turns. LAMONT is that dude. Please don't let my boy go out like that on the end. He just gotta be there. Rico gotta be family somewhere. It's so much to talk about, but I don't want to give it all away. Plus, that darn Shonna she has to go. Loved it .
Cassie never disappoints. This book was sure fire drama all the way around. I love every couple in the book. I hate what happened to ole girl. I was hoping all the couple's could make it and stick it out. Stylez is my boy. Hell, all of them are my boys. Let's not forget the girls they are on point also. Now I need part two asap, please don't be so long to where I forget part one.  Loved it .
The wait is over. It was everything I expected it to be drama. I just could not believe some of the actions that Dashawn was doing. Trust that's my man. Tekeyla she made me hot with her sometimes. I did get hot with my Trust one time he had me in my emotions. This was that fiyah. It needs to be 10 stars. Very great read and follow up to one .
For this to be this author's first book, I could not tell. It was good drama. The characters were well put together. It was like watching it go down on a tv series or something. It was good. Poopsie needs to grow up and learn to control her anger and get it together. The other ladies I like. I like Mont and Big Pops. Like I said the book was great. I am waiting on two .
It was good. I was so waiting on this. But my boy Kd,  that I did not like. I liked him. Poor Meka I hate she turned out like that. Hope she finds her way back to herself and Don .
Wow. This book was great. I did not want it to end. Why must we wait for a part two all the time. Just put what you already have ready out and stop splitting it up. All in all this book was great. Love Bianca and Quan...waiting impatiently on two .
This was good. Charlemagne u did the thing with this one. Don't be so long with part two. That ending, you know I needed more .
This was great I read part one and two in one day. I want Emery to have a happy ending. I am mad if my boy dies. I will not be able to read three if he not in it. Great read .
Great way to end this series. I was so surprised at Dontay. Hey, I was glad that Jasmine didn't dwell on it and moved on. It was a great read .
Wow! This book was definitely a page turner. I mean I don't want to give to much away, but that Tara needs a wake-up call. I know she is young but dang come on now grow up some. I know she Bern through a lot but some things you put on yourself. She knows what is not good for her but she keeps going fir it. I love Savion. Did I say I love love love Savion? Yes I did. This is her savior n who she needs. I hope it's not to late for him. It is a lot of secrets that are about to come out in part two I can feel it. That ending was something. Author Tonii I am waiting on part two .
Perfect fit.  I was originally nervous ordering because I was not sure if it was going to be the correct fit for LeapPad2.  Love it, now my grandkids little hands can grip this and not drop as much .
Excellent bookVery Realistic...Love the fact that is based on her life & the experiences... I will recommend this book to anyone especially hispanics who feel they can't full fill there dreams after so much bumps down the road .
The product worked good when it worked.  I owned it for 2 weeks and it decided to not want to charge anymore.  I am at a deployed location so stuff like this has a negative impact considering I can't drive a store or have one shipped over night, it takes weeks .
Jake Hunter: Detective Chronicles is a pretty good game.  It has a nice soundtrack which switches according to the tone being set by the story and by the seriousness of any given situation.  The characters are like-able as well.  My only issues are that there are not enough twists and turns in the stories, shifty characters are easily identified and the &#34;nice guys&#34; are as well.  Lastly, the subject matter stays relatively PG, which is to be expected, but you can't help but to wish for more serious and more mature scenarios .
I really liked this movie and the cast chosen for it.  Its not your average or cliche flick, but that's also why its not for everyone.  The characters had a wild night, but it could have been a longer one.  Over-all I'm very happy with my purchase .
This movie is a MUST SEE!!  This movie really helps people who are selfish and do not consider others.  This movie will help remove stubborn blindness .
I purchased what I believed was a sweet & innocent game from what I gathered in the movie...and I was stunned to discovered that there are wicked hidden levels in this game!  My children are not allowed to touch or view the contents within the so called &#34;highest&#34; levels!  This movie has been sitting on my desk now....it was a 2012 Christmas gift to my 8 year old son that he waited a long time to get. Now, he is very upset, and I am even more upset about this than my son.  I would like to return this movie and receive my hard earned money back .
This is a good, clean, video!  There are no hidden, evil levels like it is in the Toy Story 3 Video game .
I started taking garcinia  on April 15th. I have lost 7 lbs already. A lot of inches. I feel better and my stomach has went down tremendously. You should try it. I can't wait to order my second bottle. Oh yeah results without exercising. Even though I plan to start walking 30 min a day. I suggest you give this product a try. Good luck on your weight loss journey .
Just ordered this bag for my upcoming trip, starting end july. When i received this today I was very excited and opened up the package with much anticipation. The bag was a good size, great! The material felt like thick and durable, great! The zippers worked well and most had loops for padlocks, great! Lots of compartments within the bag for convenient organization during my trip. great!Unfortunately, the handlebar that is supposed to extend, does not extend at all. Which effectively makes this a very heavy backpack. I am processing to have this changed, but I really don't know if everything will be done in time for my trip and whether I should go purchase another bag asap.I read a review about some straps giving way and i did not heed the advice, now my turn to share my experiences. If you are buying this for an upcoming trip and do not have much margin for time, please be careful .
For $150, I wasn't expected hiss sound. It is not a lot and lower than my laptop audio hiss, but it is still there and loud enough to not be noticed during quiet passage of the song like vocal solo etc... It just makes the background not as dark as it supposed to be. The setting was low gain, low volume and bass off.Disappointed. Got Fiio E17 now, it has a far lower noise and I can live with it.3 star for nice audio and feature .
This product is good especially for the price. Compared to my canon replacement battery. I now have 3 batteries plus a car plug charger. Also I can plug in the charger for A/C. The battery won't much power on the camera but so what when its dead I'll pop in another one and put that one on charge .
Great video quality. Very pleased with my purchase. Can't wait for next episode! Very iPad friendly download. Would recommend to all .
Very good series,,,,very moving ,, very emotional ,,, could not put it down.... have not read the 3rd one yet .
I was so engrossed in these books,,,, I could not put them down....very tastefully written..l can't wait for the next one .
The style and looks are good....a little hard material,,, hard to break in.... I like a shoe you don't have to break in... They should be comfortable from the start... Have had dr martens before in brown and they were .
I like the calculator part,,, works great ,,, but the cover is too messy,,,, it is Velcro, and the glue holding it in place doesn't stay and all the goo comes out all over..... very ,very sticky .
It is a great cover,,, not big and bulky... Fits nice, easy to hold,,, and the color is good too .
I had the Litter Locker I and it worked fine, never had any problems with it. Then I moved and couldn't take that one with me. All they were selling was the Litter Locker II, so I went ahead and bought it. The first difference, I noticed, was that now it comes with this little ring that dispenses bags. I put this ring in and the main part of the locker filled up over time, but I noticed that the bags kept getting tangled up and clogged with litter. When I would try to fix it by tugging on the bag, the dispenser would feed out. When it came time to empty the bag, the dispenser was spent because of the flaw I just mentioned. I thought I'd give it another shot, so I bought more bags (which aren't exactly cheap), and the same thing happened again.I'm throwing this piece of junk in the garbage. Don't buy it. I have a feeling the redesign was just a way for these people to sell more overpriced litter bags. If it ain't broke don't fix it .
This is a beautiful shoe for any occasion especially if you are looking for a low heel but narrow in the front, so if you have wide feet this is not the shoe for you. I brought it for my daughter for a wedding it it looked lovely on just to narrow in front .
Everyone says it's a good book but so far I haven't gotten into it real well.  That's not your fault .
It was an ok book.  Not your fault that I didn't completely love it.  Another required book for a book club .
I never thought about the expiration date being so close at hand (6/2013)  I ordered too many and will never get them used by the expiration date.  Probably with postage as high as it is, it's not worth returning them.  I'll be more careful in the future.  Your is a great price, however .
I absolutely adore this shape wear. I bought it to wear under my summer dresses. Don't expect this to make you skinny, because it won't. What it does do is hold you in all the right places so that you don't bulge out in your cute tops from your jeans. It does look small, but once you pull it on it is super comfy. I plan on using this product for many years to come and plan on purchasing other styles .
Not a knife expect but this knife looks and feels amazing. I would buy it again, in fact it gives me a urge to go more into spyderco and get the next level up knives .
I expected a hot sauce that I could not even withstand but got just a intensely hot sauce. Eating a good dab of this feels like a blue flame is burning in your mouth. Its a odd clean burn feeling and it creeps up on you and stays for a long while. It tastes rather good, sweet and tangy. If your looking for a absurdly hot hot sauce this will do the trick but if you want a torture device in a bottle keep searching .
Don't be worried about this No brand universal stand not working. It just works. I'm using it with my Lenovo ideapad a2109 and it's a great fit. At first it seems cheap but when it's in it's sturdy and safe. Recommend it .
Egift cards are a fun surprise to give someone since they don't expect a gift card in there email inbox .
I love my 3ds but when getting into longer gaming sessions I feel the system to get a little uncomfortable due to its small size. With this grip it makes it feel close to a ps2 controller and its it more ergonomic and easier to hold in the hands. All the ports and sliders and accessible through the grip so I see no set backs. It is what it is and if your looking for a product of this nature im sure it will satisfy you .
Smart phones today have so many apps and features its great! But actually using them on a regular basis destroys my regular battery in like 2 hours. With this battery you can actually use your phone how you want without being stuck to a outlet. I can stream music on my captivate without worrying 24/7 about power. Its not gonna last forever like old flip phones but for the price a huge upgrade .
Ok if your looking at this headphones you might be interested in something that sounds like beats headphones (Loud and lots of bass). This covers the bill and it goes without saying that they are more clear and sound all around better. They are super loud, almost painfully loud with curtain songs and genres, also the bass response is great. There comparable to my Sony MDR-XB500's but of course not that deep but comparable. If you wanted a on ear headphone, in terms of comfort it is what you expect, your ears might start feeling numb or hurting after like 30 or more minutes but if you mess around with the positioning of the cups and things like that you might be able to stand it longer. I expected this so its not a big deal and the sound is worth it. They don't leak that much so its good for using it in public so you won't annoy anyone too bad even on full blast. My only real gripe with the headphones is that they let in a bit of ambient sound in, I mean there loud enough to tune most things out but little sounds will leak in and you might notice it. The construction of the headphone with the indestructible headband is outstanding. There is no creaking or cracking like you get with other headphones made out of cheap plastic. They feel like a premium product. So over all they look great, there made great and the comfort varies but tends to be very good.The sound like I said if your looking for a product that is not flat, that is colorful with lots of bass this is the one. For the price you wont get a better product. I love these headphones .
For the size the speaker is loud, the bluetooth sounds good, its portable, chargeable, looks good and has a line in. The bass is adequate for the size. Can't go wrong unless you expect a surround sound system in this tiny thing .
I orginally bought this for my husband, just so he could have a something to entertain himself while at work. I accidentlly ordered 2, but after playing with his I kept both( the other for myself).  My husband Is not a &#34;Techkie&#34; so it needed to be &#34;friendly&#34;. It does not have ALL the bells and whistles but it has just enough to make him happy and bring him into the 21st century. This is by no means an IPAD, it does have it's draw backs. These draw backs are nothing that we can not adjust to in light for what I bought it for. I do own a Nook 1st edtion and LOVE it. I downloaded the Nook program to the Kryos (free from GetJar), so that what ever books are on  the nook we both can read at the same time and not wait on for the other to finish. Between all three tablets I have all my bases(except a built in camera) covered that will suit us .
A very interesting book to have-for the serious minded and for those aspiring to be its bases are very straight forward, also for those who may not have certain experience but are willing to try and do the job themselves provided they do it with care. Great value for money .
Although i did not have much time in viewing it i have read a lot of reviews concerning this book i believe it is what it stands for - ie a good book to have for the serious minded mechanic and those aspiring to be .
Just got the 560 sport and I hate it.I have used it for 2 weeks and see no help of anything in my back or neck,only pain from ankels and knees from inverting.I also bought the handles for deeper inversion junk-should of known better .
Decent light output.Not as bright as I would like but better than stock bulbs still looking for something brighter than this .
Complete waste of money,showed no improvement in joint pain.Wish I had not bought it.Would like a refund but will just throw it away .
The card was in MINT condition when I opened it. The package arrived on the first delivery estimate date which made me happy and the card was not fake at all! I'm glad that I purchased this card because I need it for my Fairy deck and I recommend this card to anyone who needs it and I'm completely satisfied with my order! Fast shipping as well .
This is a great replica of the Zelda sword! You get what you see in the picture no doubt at all! There are some minor replica issues though but I find it ok .
I got this order on the first delivery estimate date! The package wasn't damaged when it arrived and the looked awesome too! This is great for anyone who loves The Legend of Zelda and for anyone who would want to cosplay as Link for Halloween for conventions! I recommend this to anyone who is a major Zelda fan and for anyone who would want to hang this up on their wall for display .
This product came in the mail yesterday! I was happy to open it and here was the delivery estimate: February 5th - Februay 9th. The package came three days before the delivery estimate! How awesome is that! I love this mat and it's a big upgrade from a paper mat they sell in the structure or starter decks. It's pretty durable too and I absolutely love it! I am not disappointed one bit. I would highly recommend this mat to anyone who plays Yugioh and the price is legit! I would definitley purchase another product from this seller again .
I got this card on the first delivery date but I didn't know that my dad had it because he lives in Long Beach and my sister accidently gave him the mail because we both have the same name!! But I really love this card and it was in mint condition as in the description and it's real too! I will definitely purchase from this seller again .
it works as far as making you go to the bathroom but thats all it does do not waste your money or time .
The picture on the front of this book was an eye catcher..to a very easy read story. Could not put it down. And I made my very own tie quilt .
WONDERFUL. When I have a blah day I listen to her and it makes me feel much better I wish she was on television and wonder why she isn't on different programs .
This spray made my tiny Yorkie smell soooo fresh and clean! He doesn't mind being sprayed with it, either. I would recommend the product to others .
I enjoyed this watch for a few weeks until it tarnished badly. It was worth it for the price, but not if you need something long-term .
This was given as a gift for Secret Santa, and received very graciously! Who wouldn't want an Amazon Gift Card .
This ring shipped very quickly, and was a great purchase. It fits my finger perfectly and looks very elegant! You can't beat the price -- I would definitely recommend it to others .
Ola bom dia tudo bem? Quero agradecer pela es&iacute;stncia do site, por meio dele estou conseguindo completar minha coleo.eu sou pesquisador das escrituras sagrada e ja tenho varias edies,inclusive a Nova Verso Padro Americano.Mas a que estou a procura no momento e a antiga: Verso Padro Americano,(original usada)de 1901 ou de 1944.Atenciosamente: Claudio .
I bought this as a replacement charger for my Kindle Fire. It was new, though genuine Motorola, I have my doubts about. That being said, it feels like it's good quality and it charges the tablet. Can't complain .
These have a slightly matte finish, but it is only visible when the screen is dark. They do exactly what they're supposed to: prevent fingerprints on the screen. The screen protector feels smooth, not &#34;tacky&#34; like some  I've purchased over the years, and it was very easy to install without air bubbles collecting. The 3-pack was a great value. I will definitely recommend these .
It is a cute case that protects my phone pretty well. The &#34;flex gel&#34; is thick, flexible plastic, not rubbery like some of the cases. I'd recommend someone get it if they want some level of protection, but not a giant box for their IPhone .
I ordered this case from Blue Top and it arrived December 31st, 2012. It has &#34;Nintendo Game Boy&#34; and &#34;Dot Matrix with Stereo Sound&#34; printed cleanly on it. All necessary slots for secondary mic, volume controls, and charger are present. It is white and fits perfectly. I ordered two of these from different places and the first one I received did not have any writing on it and was made a bit sloppily, so I was very satisfied when I received this one. Even better, it was &#60; $2 .
It was pretty desent if youlooling for down right dirt killings you not going to get it here she sound made up .
Im giving this product 5 stars because it was a perfect gift for me and my lady's anniversary. Its a great idea if you don't mind wearing necklaces. I do got to say the one bad thing about the necklace is the piece that holds the hear onto the chain isnt fully welded together much like clasps on a bracelet ect. Its a pretty bad design if you get the nacklace caught on anything that piece will break. Other then that i love it and so does she .
I haven't downloaded it yet but I'm sure it is a nice app but if you want a great app for downloading music check out tubemate .
I loved this book about a painting and the lives of two women in different eras.  I couldn't put it down.  Highly recommended .
At first I enjoyed the book but I didn't expect the storyline to involve a &#34;dark side&#34; with demons later on in the book.  As a Christian I would not have bought the book if I knew about it .
I have tried other wee pads before but when it comes to house training our puppy these are the best. They are super absorbent and they are large enough that when the puppy does go on them it doesn't leak out the sides. I would say these are the best of the best and you can't beat the price either .
Cute but not very satisfying! I would have loved some more story there! Sweet story none the less!!! :) Pure and simple love .
Not well written....to many gaps.  His first books were great. Needs to get back to his original style and ability .
Wonderful I bought this Item as a tool to help me record the time of evacuation during the &#34;Emergency Evacuation Fire Drill&#34; for my wife Home Day Care. It worked just great&#34; I recommended to everyone and for the price &#34;you just can't beat it .
&#34;Just Great Excellent&#34; it fit right in. I am very satisfied. thank you Amazon you are the best.When something is good does not required too many words, that's all I have to say .
I love it. It was a little shorter than the original for about 3 inches in long, but it is thicker and does the job which is what really matters. And for the price I think can't complaint .
I have only scanned the pages, but I had no idea there were so many varities of roses.I hope to spend many hours reading  and learning more. I have only a few roses in my garden but expect to add more to my collection.This book will help me to make wise choices. Thank you so much for sharing this beautiful book .
I loved the look and fit of the boots.  However, I was dismayed to see that they were made in China.  Can't we make this product in North America?  I hope they live up to the Harley Davidson name .
good but expensive when u use it constantly. product must be cleaned regularly. not really any other options for the humidifier tho .
I was very satisfied with book. I received the book timely.  The book had a little highlighting, but not a problem for me .
Did not like it at all.  The language was bad, and that made me stop reading.  I could read past first chapter .
good movie to rent wouldn't pay to watch it at theather. Ending was to fake for me but hey its a movie .
I never ever wrtie review unless something is really out there and i have to say i have wide feet so a regular shoe unless its in w next to it , doesn't fit me. I order some boots 8 , too tigh I read a review that they were wide enough, they werent. I sprayed this on and put a can of bean inside the boot to strch it out, left it overnight after sparaying this inside, works like miracle next night i tried on and they were perfect .
I'm echoing the other reviewers.  If you are looking for the Eberhard Faber 4009 highlighter, you will NOT receive it by ordering it here.  Instead, you will recieve a Berol highligher, in the classic (and classically annoying) neon yellow color.  I was able to obtain a refund, but that doesn't make up for the problem here.Incidentally, if you find anyone who actually does sell the Eberhard Faber 4009 highlighter, let me know .
This is much bigger than the picture shows, I can't use it at all. so, It is just sitting there and wast my money .
I feel so sorry it doesn't fit my toy, but the seller give the money back, and they told me just keep it, even I can't use it,LOL. so, it is just sitting there, but ,it is ok .
The blue brush really can clean very good, I love it. The only bad point is the box looks dirty and old, it doesn't look like a new product. but the brush is ok. i have used it over 2 weeks, it feels good .
I can't review an item that I didn't get. I asked the company about them and they said they've done all they can do....unfortunate experience but thankfully it wasn't that expensive so I didn't lose too much money .
After seeing Devon Franklin on Oprah, I decided to buy Produced by Faith.  During my June vacation on Lake Travis last year, I read the book and it was awesome.  It was just what I needed.  I had not taken a vacation in a few years and this was my chance to get some personal time with God without no distractions.  I was at a point in my life where I was seeing everything falling apart and my dreams were still not accomplished.  Produced by Faith helped me realize that my faith had weaken and I was not spending enough time with God.  I truly was not keeping my Sabbath Day holy.  I was not making God number 1 in my life.  My life was spiraling out of control because I had lost my strong connection with the source.  After reading this book I changed the way I spend my weekends, making sure I get rest, and spend more time reading the Bible and keeping a strong relationship with God.  It has changed my life.  My faith has grown and I am closer in accomplishing my dreams.  This book is an easy read and has some valuable information that will change your life.  I give Produced by Faith five stars, because a year later I still remember what I read in the book and I am still applying several lessons I learned.  So, go get the book, it is well worth it .
Some artists get stuck in the same sound and beats.  But Chrisette Michele knows how to stay in her lane and make her music better with time.  Chrisette can rock slow and fast songs, and still stay strong in her vocals and complement the beats.  I am always left feeling stronger as a woman after listening to Chrisette's albums.  Its always good to know you aren't the only one that has certain type of feelings or situations.  You will truly appreciate and relate to this album if you have ever been in love and given you're all.  "A Couple of Forevers" is my favorite song on the album; it's just a song that makes you feel good.  The only thing that is wrong with this cd is how it was marketed.  The release date should have been advertised more.  This is one of the best albums to come out this year .
Totally Surprised.  I knew Kelly's album would be good, but this album is better than good it is great and a well-prepared delivery.  Congrats Kelly, you are finally in your zone and each song shows.  Every song is great and you will be able to play the entire album through without skipping a song; unless you don't want to hear the songs that are played in heavy rotation on the radio, which cause you to know every word to the song and every instrument note being played.  R&B has returned and Kelly deserves 5 stars for this album.  She has grown since Simply Deep, Ms. Kelly, and Here I Am.  My favorite songs are Gone, Talk a Good Game, Down on Love, Dirty Laundry, You Changed, Red Wine, and This is Love.  I would analyze each song, but this album is just one you have to hear for yourself.  This is an album you must get now because it will be talked about every where you go.  Get ready, another Houston woman has just changed the R&B game .
If God had an Ipod, he would have downloaded India Arie's cd today.  If there is any question what the difference is between R&B and Soul Music, India Arie music gives the answer everytime.  This cd is for those who really want to hear the Truth being told in song form and want to connect with their soul/spirit.  I am truly greatful that God has blessed all of us with an artist like India Arie.  It is not hard to write songs or make an album these days.  What is hard is writing a song and producing an album that will not only be able to be played on earth but also in heaven.  India Arie is back and I just wish she produces more albums because in today's world we need them.  -Andrea Smith .
While I wasn't sure if this cover would work out as hoped, it has been all I'd hoped it would be.  It fits our leather sofa well, has plenty coverage on it, and appears to be made of sturdy fabric.  It does not slip or slide and stays in place when our small dog jumps on it to lay on the back.  The cover protects the sofa from the sun and dog, and that's exactly why I purchased it .
This book was a good study tool for the PTCE, I passed. There were some topics that weren't covered in this book but it did a good job overall for studying. The CD was also a good study tool as well .
I bought this for my son for Christmas and he loves it!  We have not played tons with the weather being so cold but it has seemed to hold up well and my son looks very forward to warmer weather.  It might be the name attached to the racket (ROGER) but he feels he plays much better with it .
My daughter loves this racket and it has held up well :)  Can't wait to see how it does this summer .
This game is perfect for horse lovers, so if you love horses, then get this game.There is no violence either .
This book goes straight to the point of why we need leaders like Sarah Palin.  She is not afraid to do what is right and best.  Thank you Sarah .
If this hadn't been just a &#34;stocking stuffer&#34; gift, I would have been disappointed. Probably priced a little high for what it looked like. I would look for something different next time. Didn't fit a &#34;luxury gift&#34; idea .
The little girl who received this loved the jewel-effect, but called it a barrette, it is so small. It is beautiful and seemed to be quite durable, but for a younger child who likes to dress up I am not sure it will be what she wants .
These little guys are awesome. Not sure if I got exactly 100 but I got a lot so I'm happy. Decent sized, as well. Love 'em .
I like this thing a lot, works fairly well with all of your grinding needs... Isn't getting full 5 stars simply because it isn't that great, magnet isn't very strong, etc. But overall, well worth the price I payed .
Does not charge properly , both batteries I charged were not charged even though charger claimed it was. Had to charge one of them 3 times to get it up to a charge .
Went on good but didn't adhere as expected  even cleaned with acetone prior to spraying also had a reaction with other paint I ordered and had to strip it again .
This paint would not dry over VHT  primer had some kind of reaction between paints stayed soft had to strip off both to bareetsl and reprise and paint with Rustolem and it came out fine .
This case is very protective! I've dropped my phone on it's corners about two times on concrete with this case on and because of the case, I didn't have one dent or scratch! Not only does this case protect well, but it also isn't hard to put in your pocket. I know some Otterbox cases are, but this one isn't. I highly recommend getting this case .
I didn't like this tea at all. Too much peppermint, but if you like peppermint then you may like this tea .
The spatula bends easy like it's going to break, it doesn't work well but it's cute! I won't buy another one of these .
I would not buy this pillow again if it was selling for .5 The feathers will poke you and come out of the pillow all the time, not good .
I didn't think it was possible but this is hands down the best lotion I have EVER used.  I get weird bumps on my chest from time to time and they've completely disappeared for the most part with this and my legs are smoother than they have ever been.  LOVE IT!  Will definitely repurchase when I run out .
Received this the other day. I got it party because I didn't find a good price for sensodine and I am glad I didn't. I like this version much better .
Really enjoyed this book. Even though Dave has a lot of experience as a coder, he was able to speak to non coder, no technology person like me. This book will always be on every screen I own as a reference to a wealth of developer information.Penney StephensonGood Up Apps .
There is some good information in this book dispite the fact that the cover makes me want to go buy a car from a used car salesman.  When you can find even a few new tidbits in everything you read it can make a difference.  I have to admit that I was a little disapointed in his website only because the book promises some extras there but did not deliver.All in all, the content was helpful .
This book is a testimony of how God can restore what we can readily discard, &#8220;Our Marriages&#8221; after an affair. Da-Nay shares her experience in her book which can be used as a guide or template in surviving in a marriage when a spouse cheats. Mrs. Macklin resonates with her readers because she not only writes about going through this traumatic journey she lives and breathes the success of having love after adultery. If ever a story was told in giving hope to the hopeless after an affair this is the book!!! It is a must-read for ALL marriages seeking to overcome the aftermath of infidelity .
Great great great product I'd refer this item to anyone that has an AR. No problems with install fast and easy.. just one pin and your on the way .
the ankle strap is way to short and the shoes cannot even be done up!! I will need to decide whether to return them or pay money to get the bootmaker to add a piece of leather on to the strap to kengthen it .
I haven't used it yet, but It seems to be a good product. I mean, about quality.The problem is that I didn't receive exactry the same product shown in the picture.It came in yellow with red wheel locks. Unfortunately, the vendor didn't have the correct colour avaliable so I had to keep this one because I couldn't find it anywhere else .
Horrible design, phone falls out and vibrates even on smooth roads. Can't adjust without loosening set screws, has limited mobility .
I don't review often but this book is definitely worthy of my time.  It's future  transcendentalism was gripping, though sometimes hard to follow.  I loved how it was all from Lukian's point of view.  You get totally caught up in the Hero's angst and his journey of self awareness.  It would have retracted from his drama if the author had suddenly switched to the love interests POV.The action scenes were well done as well.  Actually, they were great surprise.  This book was more Sci-Fi Drama and Action rather than romance.  I was looking for futuristic romance and instead I get this awesome mix of genres that make you think and suck you into a whole new world.  The character development was amazing for Lukian.  Not so much for Naoko, but she was more of a secondary character who was, if not quite essential to the story,  was a great character to further develop Lukian's.The ONLY reason I knocked off a star(I'd only knock off half a star if I could) on my review is because though I found Lukian's mental journey to enlightenment and freedom to be gripping, there were times it ran on and became a bit too much.  Especially at the end where things should have been coming to climactic conclusion.  It was spiritualistic and thought provoking, but it ran on a bit and I found myself impatient to get back to the action.But, in all, this was a great book and I'll definitely be buying more from this author!  Thank you Ms. McGill for the wonderful surprise that was Kain .
OMG!!  Just finished Fallen Grace!!  I couldn't stop reading this series!! I love it!! Please give me more!  Damn you and your cliff hangers!!  I can't believe how much this series drew me in!  I don't even read horror novels, but I decided to try it since it was free.  Then I had to get the next one, and the next!  Can't wait for Praying for Grace .
I've read all her fairytale time travel books and I loved them all.  I especially liked this one though.  I love beauty and the beast flavored romances and this one did not disappoint .
I literally couldn't put this book down.  I passed out at work I was so tired!!Anyway, I loved this book. The beginning was engaging (actually the WHOLE book was engaging) and the authors world building skill is obviously top notch.  The characters were well developed and their romance wasn't a rushed weird "your my soul mate" thing.  Strangely enough, the alien sex wasn't weird either.  And Meoraq is definitely alien.  Which I really like, since most of the Sci/Fi romance books that I've read have the aliens look way too human to be believable. (Usually the only difference has to do with they're penis)I was a little disturbed by the rape scenes, but they were totally believable.  I've read books where authors are too afraid to go there, even if it's the most likely outcome, to progress a story.My only issue I guess was that the whole rape, and all it's emotional side effects, was never actually addressed by Meoraq.  Actually, I felt that a couple things were unresolved.  It was a long book, but I guess it could've been longer!  But then it was one of those books that I just didn't want to end, I was so emotionally invested in the main characters that I didn't want to let them go!  I cried at the end because I wanted it NOT to end!!I don't usually do reviews(I think it's the 2nd one I've done). But I felt I had to express my absolute love of this story!  It's easily my most favorite to date.  Now I'll be comparing all other books to this one! I'm afraid I'll find them all wanting...R. Lee Smith, you've ruined me for all other books under this genre!  I'll definitely be purchasing more of your work. Well done .
I run a cat rescue, so we purchased a bunch of these because they are a nice size and the cats like them. We have them in our adoption center, and in a few pet stores where we show our cats for adoption. I have purchased more than 8 of these and I've always noticed that on the top corners of each cage where the two sides meet the top, there is ALWAYS a triangular gap, I believe because the top piece never comes flat the way it should, and the sides don't pop into place (there's nothing to hold them there so the cage often collapses in on itself during setup).. It was never really a problem until yesterday. One of our cats put his paw through the gap, and then it got wedged between the two sides of the cage. He was writhing and screaming at the top of his lungs. There was no way to relieve the pressure because the sides have to push inward to take apart the cage, and that was impossible due to the paw (it would have pulled the rest of his paw back, away from the digits stuck in the cage) It took two people to pull the sides in opposite directions to bend the bars just enough for him to get his paw free. We're having x rays done because he may have broken a digit. Thank you for your product .
I use it twice a day for over 2 weeks on the top of my toes because I rip them up surfing. I was hoping this would toughen up the skin. It hasn't made any difference at all. I took a few weeks off of surfing while using the product to see if it would work. My first day back in the water I had a new sore on the top of my big toe. I will continue to use it until the bottle is empty. Still holding out some hope .
I had never read this author before but I can't wait to read her next book in the series. I loved her characters and I can't wait to see what happens in the next  book. I loved the story line. It was a book that was truly enjoyable. It was hard to put down. Keep up the wonderful writing .
I bought this for my 2 year old and he plays with it daily in his play kitchen...great item!!! It is a bit hard to cut with the cutter as velcro is strong...however not a big problem for my son .
Different from the photo ,and the Umbrella looks sucks.I bought 2 thinks from Cowboy studio.Mettle 600W 600 True WS Dual Power AC/DC 110v IS TOTAL BROKEN AND THEY COULD NOT LET ME TO RETURN.I FEEL SO BAD WITH THEM.NEVER COME BACK. NEVER .
I bought 2 thinks from Cowboy studio.Mettle 600W 600 True WS Dual Power AC/DC 110v IS TOTAL BROKEN AND THEY COULD NOT LET ME TO RETURN.I FEEL SO BAD WITH THEM.NEVER COME BACK. NEVER.CAN NOT RETURN .
I loved this book! Kept me reading all night! Can't wait for more! Good read! Recommending to all my friends .
Not bad, it is a bit different but none the less a good game. Plus free is always a good thing .
It's just a sample chapter NUT it shows all the best games and if you didn't know what game to buy it shows you some games .
This was a very intriguing movie. The cast pulled me in to watch it and their performances didn't let me down.  As usual Meryl Streep was incredible .
It arrived quickly, in perfect shape and I had no issues. There is nothing I would change about it, besides the inability to track internationally .
You get what you pay for...  could buy at any store in the neighborhood.  Can't get replacement heads so will go with local model next time .
These are the best when you are camping and need to add a little bit of air to your air mattress.  Have the powered model to get the mattress full but that never gets it quite as full as we need.  This pump adds that extra air the other models don't have the power to supply.  Had our last one for over 10 years and one of the metal rings finally gave out and fell off.  Still used for 2 more years but decided to replace this year .
Just back from long camping weekend and the coffee pot was perfect.  Heats up surprisingly fast and the way the base is shaped is perfect for trapping the heat under the pot instead of having it all go out and up around the pot.  Handle even stays cool so you don't need hot pad to pour .
unlike the other items we ordered these fit our 20&#34; bbq perfect.  The other replacement part we ordered came in a 26&#34; length and they don't have the 20&#34; size of burner available .
put in the model number of our bbq and it said this was the correct replacement.  Our machine doesn't have the red starter button but we will adapt this one to make ours work .
We were worried that they would over fill our shoes but they didn't and they worked well keeping feet warm .
We have used these for many years.  As you get up in age you can't roll off the 12&#34; models and get going like you used to.  This height is perfect for those sore hips!  It fills nicely and holds air really well.  Perfect for camping or in home use for visitors .
Looking for an aerator that I could adjust the hot and cold to the temp I like to use to do dishes, pans, etc. and be able to stop the flow and not have to turn on/off the faucets.  This one stops about 75% of the flow .
and wow again...while I am quite proficient using herbals, not everyone is, and this book is easy to understand and use even if you are new at using/making your own herbal/natural remedies. And if you want more recipes and even more history of the herbs, check out the second herbal remedies book, and then make sure you try the other herbals in the &#34;Grandma's&#34; series. You will be glad you did .
i enjoyed this story despite the shockingly bad editing. really, get a good proofreader, dude. a disclaimer is just not doing it for me. bad spelling and grammar is very distracting. please. i would be glad to take a job (paid, of course) as your proofreader as i truly do enjoy your writing .
excellent information...and if you are a beginner, don't be afraid to add this to your working collection...the recipes are simple and easy to follow, as they are laid out clearly and step by step...this is a must have if you are interested in learning background info on the herbs you use... definitely a must read .
Outdated interface. Does not work with most new model remote starters. Ply z u have to leave a key in it .
I have read a few of H.M Wards books, but Damaged is by far one of the best books I have read in a very long time,I cannibalism, I have had them on my Kindle for a while now ,but am just now reading them, I read part one in about four or five hours,I could not put it down I would just like to thank the author for such a good book .
I loved every second of this book,it is the first one I have read by Rachel VanDyken,but it will not be my last,I laughed out loud at several scenes(think Spiders...and I also cried several times and will.most likely reread it again,a hallmark of an excellent book,would highly recommend this book .
I have never written a book review before,but having read all of the With Me In Seattle books thus far I just had to  write  and tell everyone who has ever had a big ,exuberant  family  such as The Mackenzies and have ever been in love , through all its ups and downs, they should read these books. I was a new reader of miss Proby and have come to look forward to all her new WMIS books ,and future reads as well .
This series  of books, has something for everyone, I read all of these wonderfully written.books in two days . I ran the gaming of emotions while reading these very well written stories,I laughed, cried got angry and finally rejoiced  with these couples.  I am so looking forward to the next book about the youngest brother, and I really hope that Wyatt gets his own storyline,and finds his HEA story .I have never read Me.Kennedy's work before but she has become a favorite rather quickly,and I look forward to reading more from her in the near future. I highly recommend these Welcome to Paradise if you enjoy books that keep you up just to see what happens next,then please read this series .
I have never played any games on my  kindle fire before today, I am hooked on this game.I give this game5 stars .
Thanks! I love it! It's the right size and can fit any lemon, plus it's not pricey. Deserves 5 stars .
I wore this product for years.  I noticed when they changed the cover gloss, my lips started swelling and severe chapping. I don't know if the company has changed something in the product or if I have developed an allergy to it.  Bummer .
I have not used them yet, but I  think they are going to work.  I couldn't figure out at first how to make them work, but my son showed me .
I was dissappointed.  Only one of the flowers worked like it should.  The other one kind of quivers when placed in a sunny window.This flower is a darling idea but you take a gamble if it's going to work or not.  I have bought four now and only two have worked.The two that have not worked have flip flap written on the base .
I love having Neflix on my Kindle.  If I don't want to watch the movie my family is watching, I can still be in the same room and watch something on Netflix .
There are no flaws with the game. Graphics are fantastic, gameplay is spectacular and the days give you plenty of time to get things done. I managed to get 5 ship parts on 1 day. People say its hard to find ship parts. THAT'S THE REASON WHY YOU PAUSE AND FIND THE PARTS! If you hate the game go kill yourself .
I was reluctant to order off brand because cheap charger a friend bought set her bed sheets on fire! But I feel comfortable with this product doesn't over heat but I do keep battery out when I'm charging and using the laptop at the same time. I just ordered this same charger a second time for back up laptop .
Screws were a problem- too long or not long enough.  Had to go purchase screws to make work.  For the price, not too bad .
I bought this to tie on my 3DS and I'm really happy I bought it! It's smaller than I expected but that's a good thing because it doesn't get in the way when your holding the 3DS. The paint is nicely done, I'd say about 4.5 out of 5. Overall figure is about an inch talk and the loop is about three inches. It's made with a somewhat rubbery material so it's not plastic.I really enjoy it! I'm sure I'll buy a few more eeveelutions .
I read the reviews it said they come small so I went a half size bigger and they fit well. very warm and easy on and off great, when its cold out side you don't want to fight getting them off .
i have went thru two pair.they are great,the only problem is the zippers need to be more heavy duty.thanks don't stop making .
I read that they come small that is not true. I wear a med. so I ordered a large now there to big .
works great no problems, pack it where ever you like. easy to store. very easy to clean, I wish it was heavier material .
this is a great sock, the feel while on is un matched. like any sock they are not prefect, but the best I have found .
Works great- better MPG, pickup and throttle response.  What is there not to like about this piece?  Instructions were pretty good.  Works best while installing a Cold Air Intake at the same time .
Very impressed with this upgrade. Made my Strion last much longer and is brighter. Well worth the money. Do not waste your money on replacement bulbs when you can use this instead .
I enjoyed the overall sound the speakers put out for movies and music, but you get what you pay for, I suppose. After a little more than 3 months, The speakers just stopped working. I'd say the amount of time I used them wasn't anything strenuous, and I thought that maybe it was hit with a power surge. But nothing else in the socket with it was affected, so I just chalked it up to the things not having a long shelf life. Hopefully I'm wrong because I did like them for the price. Enjoy them while you can .
This cover for my cell phone did not fit my phone and the taxes and shipping was more than the cover, and ittook too long to receive it, I will Never order another cell phone cover .
This Android cover was too small, and it looked very cheap, it was not leather at all I was totally dissapointed .
For one thing I find this vacuum very hard to empty and put back together.  Maybe I'm not mechanical but I have to take the dust cup completely apart and dig out the dirt every time I use it.  I have gone over the instructions on assembly of the dust cup many times and I can't find anything I am doing wrong.  It won't make a decent connection to the vacuum so I have to tape it together so dirt doesn't just come out of the area where the knob is to change from floor to hose.  I've tried calling the customer support line and they can't give me any advice.  It's a complete waste of money .
save a ton on hand movement and is very light to use as well as easy to use. Works like magic could not wait to get away from mouse and touch pad they don't compare .
Dungeon defender is Fun Fun. Great game easy play and easy of use, but i though the controls need some minor twinning .
Got item as described and it is a beautiful item that I could not wait for and got here on day ahead. And have lugies mansion spook ville whatever game plays on it amazing grafic for a bigger screen can wait to try zelda yea that i can't wait to try also. Thank you seller .
Very easy to use and feel very safe with it! My daughter loves it.The Isofix system adapts instantly on my seats, I never need to struggle with seat belts .
My nephew plays James Brooks in the made for TV movie. I reas the book before I saw the movie. Both were great. Their are six books in this series. Can't wait to read the next 5 and see him play his role again .
Love it! I listen to it when I am reading. If you use it with headphones, it is great to cut off any outside noises such as a lawn mower. That way there are no annoying distractions .
After all the postivie reviews I read about this item, I felt very confident purchasing it. It arrived on time and as described, these gloves are extremely comfortable, possibly most comfortable pair, I have ever received. however by the second use the left couple have a 1 inch rip. a few uses after that i noticed a half a centimeter rip on the right. i still use the gloves as the these rips have not affected the functionality but still very disappointed that my brand new gloves are already ripped and are guaranteed to get worse .
The read IS no different from reading the actual magazine. 1 totally recommend it especially when If yen have an issue with having too many old Issues Stacked up @ your house .
before I had same headphone sounding nice and I like 3 button control. But this headphone is very bad sounding. I can't use it .
There's modern than this kind of dictionary.I don't benefit of this Atlas, I'm still use mobile translator and some of websites .
Very practical, wonderful Notebook, with magnificent Winds 8Lacks a very simple thing, it doesn't have a CD WriterBut managed of external use in cases of necessity .
Easy to use nothing wrong with it but it also carries multiple sources for the next generation and more. Thanks .
We live in a home with high ceilings.  It's difficult to keep it warm.  We tried at least three others with no results.  This product is a good one.  We use it in the family room near our comfortable chairs.  It does the job very well, especially the oscillating feature.Amazon had it delivered the next day .
Not sure of intentions of Clear Channel when it comes to corporate policies, but the rips on Heart is the bomb .
I simply cannot wait to use these on my wedding day, I'm thinking of getting them engraved. They came quickly as well and well crafted .
It's a good ice tray but doesn't work very well as a baking mold.  I did happen to find out if you color the water you can make decorative ice .
U must read this book.........MUST. If you don't you would be one of the damned. So u MUST read it .
A single parent with four children in college, mentor, case manager, licensed cosmetologist,educator, mediator, degree holder and now unemployed, I truly was able to read and digest every statement surrounding the issues in America today. Just imagine I'm one person and could check off each question as if it was on my everyday mental checklist. Inspiring yet a reflection of my dispair .
It's hard to find the joists through carpet plus 5/8" of plywood which is a MUST for this product to work properly.  Finding the joists through carpet is a hit-or-miss proposition, even with the joist-locating screws that come with the system.  It never eliminated the squeaks I had, even after using dozens of the screws supplied. I finally bit the bullet, pulled back the carpet, and removed every nail in the subflooring where squeaking occurred. The location of the pulled nails gave me the location of the joists. Then I SCREWED the plywood to the joists with 4" drywall screws. No more squeaks.  I have not used this device yet on bare flooring, so I cannot comment on how well it works there .
I've had a Roomba robot vacuum for almost 2 years and I can tell you for a fact that they are noisy, of poorly quality and over-priced. The cheap plastic parts underneath crack and break at the drop of a hat. I had to remove one of the pick up rollers underneath to bring the noise level down to an acceptable level. The front pivot roller fell out after 1 month's use and now it falls onto the floor every time I pick up the vacuum.  Save your money...use a regular vacuum because this piece of junk is NOT ready for prime time .
Love the curtains they look great, they came on the day that was expected and description was as said. Thank you and totally recommend to buy you wouldn't regret it .
Great way of giving a girls phone a little umph. Not only that but another great way to protect it. So far so good non of them have broken. Thanks .
This book is well written with compassion and depth.  The subject is painful as it must be and many of us would rather not look at this side of war and politics.  For those Hawks out there, maybe this will turn them towards try diplomatic solutions just one more time.  This is a slow read for me as I can only digest pieces at a time......it is not a blueberry donut .
I was disappointed.  I love the Bourne series.  However, I found this one, predictable and gushy.  The technical aspects are faulty.  I am a nut about believeability and this story had flaws.  The romance with Rebecca especially.  Not realistic .
The plot was interesting and took a good twist.  The sex between Kate and Simon was hot and left you wanting for more.  Can't wait to read the next installment .
I didn't actually think this phone case would work, so I tested it out with an older phone that I don't use anymore and revved my bike up to top speed.  Surprisingly, the magnets kept the phone and phone case right on the gas tank.  Since then, I've used this case for long road trips where it's uncomfortable to keep my smartphone in my pocket.  I've taken it through the rain, and it's as waterproof as they say it is, too .
can't wait for the next set. enjoyed the characters and the details in the scenes, well worth the time to read .
The hat came earlier than expected.  It was not exactly the same design as the picture, however I still liked it.  (The picture is all blue, but the hat was blue/ scarlet. In Catal&agrave;: blaugrana.)  I gave it only four stars because it was not the best quality of caps, but was still good enough to warrant 4 .
the lenses did not turn darker when the sun shine at it. advertisement said it will. did not HAPPEN. need to do research AGAIN .
the lenses did not turn darker when sun shine at it. the advertisement said it will change the lens darker.... didn't HAPPEN .
comprenlo, definitivamente si quieren saber la verdadera historia de como surgio, no una banda, sino todo el movimiento subterraneo en el mundo del metal comprenlo! TRASH .
TV comes set up with the energy saver on.  As much as I would love to use less energy, the picture was not so great.  After making this adjustment it looked great!  Also the audio is not so good.  I have it hooked through my stereo and it sounds awesome .
I wasn't sure what to expect from these headphones because I had read mixed reviews of them. Being on a limited budget however I decided to take the chance and go with them. I have been very pleased with them. The sound it solid without and distortion or breakup. The range is very clear with the highs being solid without being biting. The lows are solid with out punching a hole in your eardrums. They offer pretty good sound isolation from outside sources though I will say that they do leak a lot of sound as discovered when I tried them at work and my co-workers started bobbing their heads along in time with my music. The removable mic is a nice feature for transport. You should be careful when re-attaching the mic though. It is keyed but it is very easy to misalign it. This will not stop the mic from working but if you do this do many times you will start having issues keeping the mic where you want it when using it. Overall, for the price these have been a pretty good set of headphones .
I found these guys on YouTube a while back and just thought they were fantastic. They write some great music that has a positive message. They have astounding musicianship and a very tight writing style. The music is very tight and polished but still stays honest and not commercialized. I highly recommend these guys to anyone who loves well written music with a positive message .
This is an amazing book for me. Although it had a couple of spelling errors. I was still able to read it with no problemI would recommend this book to a lot of people looking for mystery, and suspicion .
This is a really sleek and lightweight cover it really protects the phone and for the price u just can't go wrong I Purchased 2 of them and would buy another if I ever lost 1 .
It's pretty much the same as all of them it doesn't scratch ur screen so it's good with me ya .
Not so good it doesn't button up on the bottom or top I think if u dropped ur phone the case wouldn't do anything I think it would wreck ur phone. Get a speck there the real deal I got 2 of them and love then $16 on amazon.com + free shipping .
I got one of these because my friend had one. Great for emulators but won't work for shooters. Not bad .
This book was awesome! I don't usually read this genre but I picked it up one day and decided to give it a whirl. I laughed so hard reading this and finished it in a matter of days. I loved reading this from Caroline's POV and all of the nicknames she gave Simon's &#34;girlfriends&#34;. I would DEFINITELY recommend this book to everyone! Can't wait for the sequel .
This book was great. I like the way it started and I couldn't put it down honestly. I think K.S. is THE next big thing with her original writing and story line .
I honestly thought this book was awesome! The way AC writes you feel as if though you are in the story feeling the emotions of each character. I felt terrible for Andy in the beginning; it seemed like if she didn't have bad luck, she wouldn't have any at all. I thought Matt was a great person for being a stand up guy and just sitting with her when they first met and let her cry. It was just a story that I would definitely recommend, highly enjoyed, and WILL read again .
I wish this book was longer because I think it had the potential of being a great read. But to be honest, I don't understand the entire scene during the survey. What about what she was doing turned her on that much?? It didn't make sense to me. As for cliffhangers; I love them to death, but this story was so short that a cliffhanger didn't make sense. I don't know. Maybe the second part will be better and longer, but I'm not sure if I'll read it or not anyway .
What the hell? Okay, so I gave this series a try because I saw so many people had liked it and at the risk of getting trashed, I need to be honest. What about diaper sex is hot? I stopped reading right there. I also don't understand how the author was able to bounce back and forth between the characters without a heads up. Chapter 2 had me wondering if he was gay because he never clarified he was writing as Tara. My next gripe with this book was that they pretty much fell in love while waiting in line to audition for the TV show. I'm kind of wondering why I also read the word cock at least ten times before I got to chapter 3. Maybe I didn't read the same book as everyone else and props to people that really enjoyed it! Sincerely! I think this story wasn't everything it was hyped up to be. Sorry .
Love love loved this toy!!! It's perfect for my little girl. She's 4 months old and loves pulling and grabbing on it. The only thing I'm sad about is not getting the pink one:/They didn't have it when I placed the order. Overall I'm so pleased. It's very well made and the colors are amazing. I also ordered the peacock and honestly I prefer This one. I hope my LO will enjoy it for a long time .
Came in today and I ordered it Friday!! Received it a lot sooner than I expected 2 business days!I bought this for my baby, she's only 3 months old but I was a little too excited about getting it for her. Overall I'm very pleased. Bella is super cute and very well made, appears to be very sturdy... I love the colors, the music and the quality. It's a little short but I think it adds to it's charm. Can't wait for her to be able to ride. I can see many years of fun, not just for my baby girl but for my nieces and nephews too. For now it's going into storage. I read lots of mixed reviews but decided to take my chances. No regrets Five stars and would totally recommend .
First off I didn't buy it here, found a better price elsewhere, got it on sale:)I ordered this for my 3 month old. She didn't pay too much attention to the hanging toys but loved the music when she kicked the piano. Hopefully she'll grow to like it a lot more. The only complaint I have is the mat is paper thin. I put the pack n play mat out and put this on top, that worked out better for us. The colors are beautiful and overall I'm happy with it. I would recommend .
This watch arrived in great time.  I don't think I've ever received a product so quick.  As soon as I received the watch, I eagerly opened it quickly and this watch was just as promised.  The watch is in great condition, and it does all the functions that the seller advertised.  I am very happy with my purchase (love my watch and get many compliments on it when I wear it), and the seller was great .
I can't TRUST Amazon to package properly, I wasted TIME meeting the UPS delivery man ( did not know they may have broken it ) , I wasted MONEY on something that cost more to return than to use as a dummy camera ; It may not have been a lot but it WAS MINE ! 700 TVL weather proof bullet array ir led security camera low illumination high resolution by evertech may be a good product but ONLY IF you can WALK INTO A STORE,PICK IT UP ,PAY FOR IT , TAKE IT HOME , SET IT UP FOR USE  never trust prime/amazon shipping ! It is just not trustworthy or worth it .
This was a Gift  Im sure  its fine when it arrived  it was in good shape it wasn't squashed or anything .
I love this movie I've watched it many times on  TV  I've  been trying to buy this movie for yrs. I didn't watch it yet but I am sure it works fine.  It came sealed  as new  dvds  do .
The dvd was a gift to my granddaugther, she said she loved it. I really can't say anything else I didn't see it. She has all the Caribbean Movies  I just forgot to get her this  1 .
My granddaugther loved it. She couldn't wait for it to come out on dvd I can't say anything else because I didn't watch it  nor do I want to .
I would like to take a moment to say thank you to Mr. Mattair for writing this book. This book is a great read and the author was so transparent, he wrote from life experiences and also gave insight on how we as men can make ourselves and our families better. My favorite channel was ME vs ME. This channel probably describes a lot of us and how we allow ourselves to fall victim to what I would call the I don't think I'm good enough or I don't have what it takes syndrome. I'm sure most will agree we are our own worse stumbling block. Anyways enough from me, I recommend you get your copy and I'm sure you will find a channel or two that fits you .
I am really glad I chose this item. I took it and lost 6 pounds the 1st week. That was without any working out or eating any different then I normally would. I absolutely do not regret choosing this item! I will deff be buying another LiveTru item .
I'll start by saying that the grips once on they look amazing I have them on a t120 from tristar very good and reliable gun the reason I am giving these grips a 3 it's because they did not seem to fit properly it took some force to get them in and I mean lots of it to the point I thought they were not going to fit the gun but once on they made my gun look better and I feel like my accuracy improved hope this helps .
This was a birthday present for my daugher. The radio and all the features was great and it works perfectly!  The one problem we had was the kit to install was not complete to put it in her truck. The clips to hold the unit in were not included and the directions were not very clear to install, we had to call tech support twice for help on wiring.  But after it was finally installed it works great and she loves it!  Can't beat it for the price .
Not very sure if i ordered the one I need. When I got it and  tried it, it was just right size for my small wrist. It was easy to use. I am very satisfied .
Very disappointed with the batteries. It didn't last and when i charge it it didn't work. I wasted a lot of money on these batteries. My recommendation never buy it .
I love this book..WHO KNEW NOT ME!! Buttah is one bad bitch! Turned out better than I thought it would .
First off, the artwork in this book will blow you away. Second, the story is insanely well written. I dove into this with no knowledge of GOTG, but now all I want is for Vol. 2 to come out. Everything is wonderful, leaving me hoping the movie will possibly live up to it's roots .
First time every having it, I wasn't a happy camper. i used it for a week- it was pretty big and it shrunk immensely. Granted - it didn't get rid of it but I have no discomfort, no pain, and it shrunk to a size that I barely notice its there. I would recommend it .
I prefer to buy heavy duty wee wee pads to help prevent my wood floors from getting ruined. I usually spend 56 dollars for heavy duty wee wee pads 2&#34;x3&#34; from shack a paw in union. They work awesome, So i thought, trying to save a couple dollars, I would try these out. Well they are no where near as durable as what they made themselves out to seem. The wee wee pads would separate into two pieces once my pup went to the bathroom. Also they don't seal the wee wee pads all the way around, so even if you pup has great aim and hit the middle it would still leak out to one of two unprotected sides, Lastly when I would pick up the pads after my pup used it, the pad would start dripping due to such little absorbing padding.  I have a 17lb Shiba inu so its not like the pads needs to absorb a gallon. I personally am looking elsewhere, But ill give the option that maybe i just got a crappy batch .
add a little humor to it, but I really did. we put it on her and follow the instruction. I will admit i was skeptical but to my surprise we measured her waist prior and after (she wouldn't let me post her waist size) and it was 3-3 1/4 inches smaller. I, as a typical guy, don;t know how long it lasts or how it works but hey - Shes happy therefore I'm happy.  I would recommend it .
It works well, simple to use. a little annoying have to pull it out and work it back in but not to bad. but i do like the compact and organized part of it so I would recommend it .
Worked for a couple hours. Then stop charging and can't load songs.  Had to wiggle it and get it in certain position for the connection to catch.Haven't tried talking to the seller .
I waited so long to get this bag I ws hesitant to buy it because I thought it was too big finally I have receieve my tiny weeny bag I can't believe this why would you name the bag large its not even medium sized and the straps are too short .
I purchased this with the thought that it would be a great resource for an extended essay concerning selection bias and the nature of both science and philosophy.  I was thoroughly disappointed.Bostrom attempts to demonstrate the invalidity of a multitude of both uses and interpretations of the Anthropic Principle, generally claiming that whomever he is currently proving wrong is incorrect because he (Bostrom) is going to define the words they used differently.  In other cases his examples simply make no sense (it is obviously reasonable to assume that actually drawing the shortest straw from a stack of 1,048,576 is due to chance, and not due to rigging of the system).He seems to have a general lack of actual understanding of the physics he is dealing with, a view easily obtained with but a little background research.  The language he employs is overly superfluous (just as that was), and at times he sounds like a preppy school boy showing off the language he just learned for the SAT.I will admit that Bostrom had some valid points, but the style of writing and his obvious bias (ironically favoring a multitude of authors (Leslie, van Inwagen, etc.)) made it exceedingly difficult for me to read the book in its entirety, resulting in a very premature abortion of the reading.I believe Bostrom's book is a great example of the effects of selection bias, demonstrating the irrationality that it can lead to and its ability to corrupt even those who are purportedly well-versed in it, and would recommend reading it only to see this phenomena .
I followed the directions and dogs smelled it and deficated anyway.I would not buy or recommend this product toanyone .
No Eric! The show pretty much died when that happened. I can live with Hyde and Jackie break-up (though it was sad), I can live with  Kelso not being in too many episodes. But Have the show w/o Eric! That's ridiculous! The show is about him and his family. The best part of the season was the final episode .
I used this supply everyday all day and never had a problem. When I surged in load it shutdown to protect itself but besides that it was EXACTLY what I needed .
Whilst I usually enjoy Herron's books this one was a bit lacking.  It is clearly written but there was nothing really striking or memorable about the plot or characters.  It was the kind of book that was used to pass the time and then forgotten as soon as it is over .
Nothing too fancy, but gives a good protection of the phone from sudden fall on the ground.Phone felt several times from hand and not a single scratch. :- .
The actual size of the wallet is too far small than the picture. I don't know how it happens. But I still like the shape .
This is enough with the written review- it was just not my favorite which could mean its just me not the material .
It fills its purpose. By the way, I haven't figured out what Marware is or is not; leather or not .
I really wanted this cover because it was so cute and it was my favorite color but unfortunatly it wasn't for my computer. I really wish it fit my computer. I would of loved to purchase it .
It met exactly the description from the computer and i love my new computer to the point where i don't want anyone touching it .
Got this for my boyfriend and I.. they come in very handy and they work great. Love when I'm at work and can't charge my battery I can just put in another one .
I bought this case after watching reviews on YouTube.It offer good protection and I do feel it keeps the iPad pretty safe.The down side is the screen protector is terrible. It has a pixel look to it.The screen protector even has lines that you can see when the display ison a full whit page or a solid color background.I emailed the company that makes the case and they asked all the usual questions-Did you buy it new?Where did you buy it?Can you send pics?I answered all the email and send over 20 pics and also the pics of the packaging.Everything they had asked for. Then that's it. No more emails returned from the company.They offered no insight to why the case looked this way or what can be done about it.I feel the company doesn't back up the product at all.I have had much better customer service from OTTERBOX.I will not buy any more products from this case company.It wasn't worth the money.Lets face it- these the people making these cases are making a fortune off us.They are all over priced and at least should stand behind what they make.So buyer beware .
I bought these for my boyfriend and I was kinda guessing on the size but it turned out that they fit him perfectly and he loves them. He says that they're super comfy and he can't wait to get back into MMA .
This book was very informative, with easy to follow directions. The materials used in the projects were easily acquired and not very expensive. Great book .
Really interesting tidbits abouts these great men and their families. Fun entertaining read for those who want to learn more about historical figures but don't want to get bogged down in volumes with 1,0000's of pages .
No one can beat Doyle's story-telling style. I have read some stories years ago but am glad to read this complete collection. I enjoy the way the stories tie together. The book and T.V. charecter &#34;Adrian Monk &#34;surely must have been based on Holmes charecter .
These were advertised for hearing impaired. Quality is geat but I expected something that I could increase the volumn, not just decrease it. That is a big letdown. I felt this product has misleading advertizing .
Delivery time wasn't bad however when I got the product several of them were green and only three of them were yellow. I didn't get a single blue or red and most of the green ones I got were busted and the ink was all over the packs, I don't exactly recommend buying it if you really want good pens or a good selection .
The applicator doesn't apply well, the slates aren't easy to clean at all and half of the time the designs don't even print onto the applicator or the nail .
It was nice at first but the feathers come off easily and over time the face rusts so it's not something you can keep for a while .
I think the size should go a little higher but over all it's nice fitting, it's snug. The cuffs are especially snug as well as the bottom part but if you stretch it out a bit it's not too bad. It's very soft too .
It works great just doesn't produce the kind of curl that is really my style :) But other than that its pretty, easy to use and shipped on time and not damaged .
Two wheels did not know thatBought a very cheap price, the kids do not like iti'm going to buy something better in the next .
not recommended, the graphics of the shorts are good but the pad was much to large. I would not suggest buying this .
Would have been five stars but speakers were not rated high enough for this system should have been 50 watt at least then it will sound better at high volume .
There's no words to describe these! We bring them into our office frequently and simply can't get enough.  Seriously. We can't get enough.  We are stuck in a groove.  Our current average is about 3 boxes a day (2 white cheddar, 1 zesty ranch).  Keep it comin Sunshine. Maybe some Parmesan grooves? Pepper jack? Who cares! Just give me more grooves .
This necklace was the perfect gift for my mother. It fit her perfectly and was jus the right length. The charm is a bit top heavy, other than that nothing wrong .
Item came exactly how it was described, no dings and no dents at all. Great gift idea for a last minute gift. Fits 6 beverages perfectly in it .
Loved this show.  I wish it had never ended.  One of the best collection I've seen in a long time .
The scale provides weight in pounds and decimals instead of pounds and ounces. Not very practical. The off button doesn't work either, but it does go off after a few minutes by itself. That drains the batteries. It works but otherwise not impressed for 16 .
Really disappointed,only for slender people.just not worth the money.send my money back quickly. I don't recommend this apron to anyone .
It does okay,moves sometimes when driving in a curve.my sunglasses stay put but phone moves. Will not recommend to friends .
bought this because I just bought a house and the carpet was a little wrinkly... keep in mind this item is not made for contractors but it did what I needed it to do ... don't expect to do a 20 foot room with this but smaller rooms it did with a breeze .
very beautiful silverware.. has some weight to them but by far a very nice set... couldn't be more pleased ... delivered on time and am as happy as I could be...thanks .
arrived on time and in perfect condition..product was one of the first things I bought from amazon and couldn't be more pleased... wanted to use it for my tractor for a back up charger but it did charge my Silverado truck in about 20 minutes from a dead battery ... great little charger... thanks man .
been looking for a few years for the howling diablos cd's... never wanted to pay 20 dollars for em though... great Detroit band and great cd ... thanks man... made my drive's a little more enjoyable .
I get one of these by mistake ...thought it was aluminum foil... my bad... it'll get used up just the same though...summer bbq's are coming and used it a few times last ... no complaints here though .
I have newfoundland dog ...bout 150 pounds.. just wanted to keep her safe during hunting season... love the way I don't have to put her legs through some holes... that's a hard thing to do when your dog don't wanna cooperate. the quick slip around belt made that easy as well as just slipping it over her head.. she does not even mind it... I think she likes it even. and it's not made cheap ... should last us quite a few years .
bought this because I was having problems with my sony cybershot... didn't fix the problem but definatly let me know what I gotta do now with it... thanks man .
I bought this to replace the one that a ex friend of mine from middle school stole, and it came in pretty good condition. The back cover has a fold about as long as the paine section on the front cover, but I bought it used so i expected to get not-pristine condition. (Plus the seller sent along a note apologizing and I think there was a free gift in there but i'm not sure, i mostly remember the note - this was awhile ago) Everything is there including the poster of all the dresspheres and stats.It really is great and if you don't care about minor damage, save money and buy it used. If you want it in perfect condition then buy new and you don't have that possible worry ;P .
I liked the book but i wasn't expecting it to be from a library. I thought it would be a new copy .
There was a fold on a couple of the pages but other than that it was still in good condition. And i bought it used rather than new so i figured it wasn't going to be factory sealed condition, like it would be if i bought it new .
First off, let me point out that despite its many flaws, i still like the set of mini figurines. Now let's move on.Don't expect to recieve figures that look exactly like the picture because you won't (or at least I didn't). Here is the list of flaws in my set:--Sakine Meiko (red outfit)'s hair is blond when it should be brown--Luka's hair color was more of a washed out pale pink than the vibrant actual pink shown in the image.--Kaito Shion's coat has no blue in it whatsoever when there should be blue edges--other small details that only bother people who want perfect accuracy (mostly i was concerned with the above)I still like it, but i just wish it was more accurate to the picture .
First off, let me point out that i got the Greatest Hits reprint, and don't see anything different from the original printing. Everyone seems to care which one they get but personally I don't.Now then, The game has no scratches or fingerprints when I got it and the little booklet, and the game works perfectly fine; except for one tiny thing. In one of the beginning scenes, it gets to one point mid-way in the cut-scene and then it skips (even though the game is still unmarked). However, if you just hit the [x] button, it skips the rest of the scene an you can move on to the fun part - actually playing it.I tend to have bad luck with things, so it's probably just that i got the one out of a million that has a glitch- but it's really no problem and i don't care anyway, i enjoy the gameplay more than the cheesy cut-scenes .
The box came in good condition even though I bought it used. I haven't played it too much yet because i've been busy with school and whatnot, but what bit i did play didn't have any problems. There were no scratches on the discs .
First off, i got the series as a birthday gift for my dad because my parents are both fanatics of the series. And while i like it a lot too, I wouldn't say i'm obsessed over it like i am with other shows (like Doctor Who &#60;3).The item itself comes with 8 dvds and a slip-case cover as shown in the picture. So far, they all play beautifully with no problems in quality or skipping. If i remember correctly, getting this boxed set it cheaper than getting them separately here on Amazon. (and it definitely is a lot cheaper than getting them all from Best Buy). So if you have the money, it's well worth it to get this collection .
nothing wrong with any of the set, and it suits my needs for organizing and compacting games well. Not broken .
Well let me point out first that while it says XL, I think it goes by (here comes the hating from people) stereotypical asian sizes because I fit into a XL or a L depending on the store, but this XL cloak feels more like an L. HOWEVER, it does fit and that's all I really cared about. It doesn't have any stains or anything, and the cloak is accurate to the Akatsuki design.((by the way, for those who wanted super accurate cosplays (with the fishnet and pants all underneath) you will have to get that separately. This is only the cloak)) I felt that i needed to say it because some people think the fishnet will be attached to the cloak (because some cloaks do have that) but this isn't one of them .
First off, this is one of the first vocaloid figurines I ever bought, and i really like the design and poses. However, the head weighs alot more than the rest of the body so it's never fully on straight - if it moves then the head either lolls back or falls off entirely. That being said, I still think it's a cool figure for the Snow Miku 2013 .
The necklace is accurate in every possible way (except the length of the chain but that's ridiculously easy to fix) and is beautiful. I couldn't find something to complain about if i tried, it's really good for anyone who likes (or wants to cosplay) Squall Leonheart .
If you liked the game, then this is a great addition as it comes with so many Project Diva-themed designs. The mini Miku on ur controller, controller AND 3 different PS3 decals for different versions, and the controller are all really cool looking and make your system and accessories blue-er. The pic keychain is one of my favorite parts though, i really like the design.(by the way, I didn't notice at first, but the Luka, Rin, Len, and Miku headphones are cord organizers, so that wires aren't scattered all over your entertainment area.)All in all, this is a great set to go with your Project Diva F game for the PS3 version .
There are no complaints I can make about this at all. I bought it used but when it arrived it looked like no one had touched it before me. It came with everything in the description except I actually got a little card with it too. I'm not sure if it's just a commemorative card for a box set or if it has something to do with the music but it sure looks cool. (If anyone knows what this card actually is for, letting me know would be great by the way :3)Basically, this is more than well worth your money if you like Vocaloid and the Hatsune Miku Project Diva series .
I love this necklace especially the way the blue color pops out. If you like kingdom hearts, then why not go ahead and get this? I bought it used and it still came in great condition .
It's a very accurate keychain of Marluxia's favored weapon. Just a word of advice, don't put it on like your purse if you have a small one. Because of the way it's designed, if you attach it to something small it may catch on things and break even though it's sturdy metal. I really love it though .
The saying goes &#34;you get what you pay for&#34; and this is a good example. This $4 ring looks alot better in the picture than it does when it gets to you door. HOWEVER, for $4 it is a good buy and it is unmarked and the kanji in the ring is accurate (although it is a brighter red than it should be, but that probably only bothers fanatics of detail- which isn't me too much because I like my sanity ;D )All in all, it's a good ring for cosplaying Itachi (or even just to wear normally .
The necklace came in great condition and it looks really cool. I can't really find anything to complain about. yay .
What an amazing book it had me captures from the start to the end. I could not put this book down!! It's a book that will make you be thankful for what you have and for sure will not leave you with dry eyes! Wonderful job Alison Bailey .
One of the best books I have read in a very long time. I was hooked from the first page to the last page. Could not out down the book once i stared. It was well written and developed with a very good story line that is unquie. I loved it and can't wait to read more by this author .
From start to finish, the story unfolds. No slow spots, no let downs. Would have been five if not for a few predictable scenarios .
Well i received the box yesterday and when I opened the it seemed a litte bit damaged. The glasses are ok, they have no scratch or things like that , but the RB label on the left side of the glasses, keep me thinking about its originality. Two weeks ago i bought i fake pair and when I went to the optic shop, they told me that was very 'rude-made' because you actually could feel the label like it was maded by a sharp object, this happens again with these glasses, I can feel the label 'scratch' from behind the glass. So I'm not pretty sure if a real one or not.I will carry them to the optic again (2nd time, buying fake stuff) to see what happens.UPDATE:FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE THEY WERE A GOOD REPLCA BUT IN COMPARISON WITH THE ORIGINAL RAYBAN'S THEY SEEMED BARBIE-PLASTIC!I'M REALLY ANGRY WITH THIS SELLER AND WITH AMAZON, SELLING FAKE STUFF, AND STEALING MONEY.I DON'T RECOMEND YOU BUYING GLASSES FROM THIS SELLER, EVEN THE CASE, BROKE AFTER TWO OPENINGS!I LIVE IN COLOMBIA SO ITS PRETTY HARD TO REFUND THE ITEM AND IS EXPENSIVE AS WELL. IT'S REALLY BAD, IT GIVES A BAD IMAGE TO AMAZON.SO THAT'S IT I LOST MY MONEY .
I received the product with no troubles. It works perfectly, as soon as I opened it, I tested it in my body, it has no pulling-feeling, and it's really gentle with the skin. The trimmer is perfect, it has 5 lengths, but I think it is plastic maiden, and I think it might break easily. The shaver works almost as a razor, the shaving is pretty close, but if you use it  in different direction it has nothing to envy to a straight razor. The instructions said, that you have to get used to the machine, and your shaving will improve in several weeks, If it is true It would be better than a razor. I just tried it once, and I am already pleased with this product.I had some issues when removing the blade of the shaver, you have to grab and pull, just the blade, not the plastic zone around it. I tried to pull all the parts together and I nearly broke it.Well i'm really satisfied so far with this product. I hope it works as good as now, in a few months .
I received the product in perfect conditions. The Ipod was ok, with no scratches or things on it.It was sealed and it works perfectly. I strongly recommend this Ipod, is really nice and portable.This is a 2012 edition Ipod ,i think is smaller than the previous one, and is more square-shaped.Nice, i have no complains about it .
I was impressed at how well the actresses played each role. They were fantastic. This movie is very funny. If you find a fully clothed, male, minor wearing a bra in order to annoy his sister &#34;offensive,&#34; then steer clear. Otherwise, you will find this movie very entertaining .
My face glowed when I saw them & they're sick and comfy!!!! These are my new favorite socks I never want to take them off .
One of the two cords I bought worked for neither of the three iphones I tried it for. Very disappointing .
Looks good but when you shake it a big amount of dust coming from it.  First my wife says maybe it's starch but it smells more like dust/not clean.  So when I woke up this morning using this comforter I right away noticed how stuffy my nose was and my eyes were very dry.  The night before was just fine.  Called the company in New York and all the people I spoke to were Chinese.  They did say that down was coming from China.  Something fishy the way this company is trying to do business.  We all know US made products are 95%  quality stuff and vise versa with Chinese product.  So, they seem to want to say mande in US but in truth it is who knows what inside of it.  My guess after using it one night  a mixture of feathers and saw dust .
Great super bright light. It lit up my pole barn at 250 feet with a blinding white light. Not too concerned about short duration of hi lumen light as I use it intermittently as an electrician. For long term applications I would choose another light source. But as a belt flashlight,(with holder) it can't be beat for tradesmen. It is too bad Streamlight chose to make it in China... That should anger any American .
when I first heard this song I could only rememeber one lyric "and now your taking her to every restaurant, and every where we went come on!" I fell in love with this song and it took me a long time to find it. its a really good song because that actually happened to me, but he didn't want me back .
This is a really great story based off of the movie, even though they didn't use the real actors(considering the fact that they dont have enough money and Woody Harrelson is probably still working on the hunger games) the plot was still the same. it is as funny as the original zombieland. i hope it makes it to the medium screen .
This is a really good game, you;- Collect over 50 different types of guns- level up easily- cash and gold coins are easily obtained- you don't lose health too easilyMy only problem is that energy takes a long time to fill up .
Battery didn't last more than 5 mins for my fianc&eacute; to even get excited it was his valentines day gift .
We bought this vacuum after getting tired of other brands of vacuums that lost all suction in the first couple of months and then never got any better, and than broke after 3 years. So far this Dyson has a much better clean than the others we've had, and it hasn't lost any suction in the last year, we are VERY happy with it .
There is nothing here  what a complete waste of money.they won't let me give less than one star or else I wouldn't even give this piece of trash that .
I really like this movie alot and i loved the price on it. Granted they didn't have it in stock when i ordered it but i still got it very soon afterwards .
Like the title says it looks great and is doing well in my computer it isn't the most compatible RAM for my PC but it still works great .
I absolutely love this thing i am using ir now as a matter of fact the size is nice and it is easy to use.So i am now a few months into owning this monitor and i am still very happy with it. It has all the ports i need and it is a very nice size. perfect for me. There is one small problem with it and that is the bag that you can carry it in is very staticy on the inside. I don't like this about the bag and have thus quit using it for transportation and now quite simply i use a towel. But other than that it is a great monitor. Well worth the money in my opinion .
This case looks amazing. The cable management options are amazing. ALso the case is very good at keeping the computer quite. I almost can't hear the computer running. Good buy .
I could not put it down.  I wanted more.  The author held my attention from the beginning to the very end.  I am looking forward to the next book .
I have been taking 2 capsules a day for a month now and also working out at the gym regularly. i didn't see any difference causing appetite to be curbed at all. Also have been watching what I eat, but to my disappointment my weight remains the same or infact looks like i have gained a couple of pounds. I surely am uspet having wasted money on this product. Please read all the low rated reviews too before buying this product and wasting money. I have paid for the disappointment I guess .
Tested it out on a trinity and it would not boot at all. Messed with the wiring, changed the settings and nothing worked. Eventually I tried just replacing the coolrunner. Exact same wiring and it booted fine, everytime within 20 seconds max. So I know it wasn't the wiring, just a faulty chip. Have not tried it on a phat yet but I can say it's not very reliable for slims .
Works perfectly. No problems, good price, fast delivery. 5 stars. Also, I've noticed that it is pretty discrete and not too flashy, which is great for me. I would recommend this to someone looking for a car charger .
real page turner, love all of John Grisham books and this is one of his best, i'm still reading it on my Kindle and can't wait to see the outcome .
this was such a heart warming book, I didn't want it to end it was lovely following thier story can't wait for a follow up .
love this wallet the leather is very soft and comfortable to hold, there is plenty of room inside for cards and 2 I.D slots, the coin section doesn't open very wide but I don't carry a lot of coins so it's ok for what I need .
nothing to say only that they arrived on time and the package was well packed love PG tips reminds me of home .
I have been looking for a copy of this movie for years. Now I finally have it. I don't know why but this movie has a hold on me. Kind of like Empire Records, lol .
The print, condition and quality of these pieces are excellent! I will buy more as gifts for my friends and family who don't have these .
I like many others bought this to add to my current dice total and hoped to get some more complete sets. Well, the dice were against me this time! Ugh, I hate those days, lol. NOT ONE complete set aside from the guaranteed complete WizDice set!!Now, I know this would tick off most people but I had to look at what was advertised and what I received. What was advertised was &#34;100+ pack of random polyhedral dice in multiple colors plus free pouch set...&#34; and this is EXACTLY what I got. So I cannot hold the lack of complete sets against them.  I have been out of D&D; since right before 4th edition came out and recently had a resurrection of gaming partners who were missing it as much as I was. I even went the next mile at this time of year and paid the money for next day delivery. Now mind you this is the 20th of Dec. The package showed up in just less than 24 hours! I couldn't help but be amazed and excited. The dice are all in great shape and a pretty equal amount of each dice. I even ended up with one d30! The following is the breakdown of what was enclosed in the package;One complete WizDice set in pouch translucent purple.16-d4  11-d1014-d6  16-d1216-d8  15-d2019-%d  1-d30With the condition of the dice, the speed of delivery and the pretty equal breakup of dice I have no reason to give less than 5 stars. The disappointment in no complete sets is on me. All in all I would buy this again .
I love pretty little liars once you get started you won't want to stop until you finish it. Sara did a great job .
totally awesome its fun and you don't have to purchase extra content to enjoy playing it. i love this game .
Its so hard to stop playing. Its such a great game! Im addicted! You will never want to put it down .
I agree with the below comments. Great quality and will last a long time to come. The bar came to my house but had to pick my plate order up at the local post office though, no worries. The postal worker was angry cause he said they were heavy and he had to bring them from the table to the desk. I took them to my car, went back in and called him a, "wimp!" (I'm a 120 pound female .
We have had this bird bath for 10 years, & it is only now showing some small cracks. The place where we purchased it, is no longer in business, so we were thrilled to find it at Amazon!  We use it year-round, & when it gets full of ice, we pour boiling water in it to melt the ice, & then dump it out & fill it again with warm water.  We fill the base with sand, & that takes care of any fear of it falling over.  It is so easy to empty the water out by just lifting the top off & dumping out the water!  The birds just love this bird bath, & we just love watching them .
I am not a big online shopper but had to have these. All the other reviews had me split down the middle on what size to pick. I followed the sizing guide and everything is perfect. I am thinking that some consumers might be a little naive when it comes to their &#34;actual&#34; size. Great buy, highly recommend .
said it was leather, I figured it wasn't but, I did not expect it to be vinyl. I thought it was supposed to have a stylus also .
The size is not the problem. It fits right in size but you feel as though you will loose your balance. It seems to me that the heel is not placed properly. It goes inwards making the shoe feel less sturdy.  These are not thin heels, so I was suprised at the fit. I felt as though I was going to fall frontwards.  I will try to repair them otherwise they are going back.  too bad because they look great .
I have had my tablet for about a week now and so far I have no complaints. It is very easy to you and the android market makes things a lot more convenient and easier to use. I purchased the tablet so my seven year old son could play games and so that I could do homework from my student portal and I have been able to do all of the above .
Bought these waders for a fishing trip in NY mostly for the pricepoint. I'm just getting back into fishing and didn't want to drop a lot of cash for something I will be using only a few times a year. They were perfect in all aspects: boot size was right on, the rest of the waders fit perfect, not too tight, not too loose, very comfortable and easy to get on and off, cleated sole held nicely in the creek i was fishing, no leaks and don't anticipate any unless I happen to fall on some jegged rocks. All in all a great product for the price and yes I caught quite a few fish .
I never buy off brands and I decided to give this product a try because I was tired of paying the a high price for a top name. There is absolutely no difference in this brand. It produces great quality prints with no alteration in color. I will definitely be ordering more .
Spying on a new level. I live an area that experiences a lot of break ins. I purchase this clock as a security measure when I was not at home. I actually experienced a break in shortly after I set my camera in place, and thanks to this spy camera I was able to retrieve all my personal belongs and the burglar was charged with theft. The thing I love the most about this spy camera is that no one would ever suspect an alarm clock as being an actual spy tool. The video is high quality and it is very easy to set up and use. I also like that the unit has an external power supply so it records continuously. *Review for free product .
I have ordered the product several times and they worked very well. I have no complain at all.... Love the product so much!!!! Would definitely continue to purchase this item in the near future .
W&H is a must have for Greek students. This Greek is a compilation of the oldest Greek manuscripts from the late 3rd and early 4th centuries. Secondly,in contrast to the NA27 which is a compilation of literally hundreds of manuscripts across the centuries by good scholars, it fills a niche of comparisons and good textual criticisms of all texts. Thirdly, it also provides a foundation for comparing the Textus Receptus against the older manuscripts. Finally, the benefit of the W&H Greek Text is to reveal the many Latin transliterations that were imposed upon the KJV. Factually, much of the KJV was rendered not from the Greek but from the meanings of the words from Latin in the Vulgate. Therefore, keen insight can be derived from impartial and accurate analysis from the W&H Greek. Much new and good scholarship has occurred in the last 150 years regarding Koine Greek. I am a 30 year student of Greek since college. I still learn new insights everyday from a strong, Greek study. W&H Greek Text is an asset to any literate reader of Greek .
I was concerned twenty dollars was too much for a chew toy, but there was so much press around it, I had to get one for my daughter. It smelled better than most toys and tasted neutral to good (yes, I tried it.) and I think the way her legs can reach my baby's molars is great, most chew toys don't get quite back far enough .
I cannot say enough about how natural these feel to my infant. She wouldn't accept any other kind of nipple and the flow system is inventive and it really works. No more milk leaking down my babies neck.  Dishwasher safe. I now own 12 of these bottles and they''re the only kind I'll use  or buy .
For as fast as kids grow, these are perfect but might not hold up as hand-me-downs. You can't beat the price on Mato & Hash clothing .
looks gorgeous in this Xmas dress. I have never seen anything so cute, while being well-made, and comfortable for her. I did order a 12 mos. for my 8 month old daughter who is tiny (15lbs) for 8 months, so it runs a bit small .
The Power of the Penny is a beautifully illustrated children's book with truly valuable moral lessons. The book encourages kids to follow the lead of Abraham Lincoln, the president pictured in the penny, by respecting, loving, and treating righteously oneself and others. The book teaches children that the penny is much more than just a coin; it's a sign and a reminder of equality, freedom, honesty, and spirituality-values that Redmond challenges kids to pursue in their own lives. The book includes great activities for children, showing them how by taking action they can make a change in the world. The Power of the Penny is a much more than just a children's book; it's a book that every parent should read to their kids .
Horrible, after one use I can't get it to go back to it's normal form even though I've tried putting it in boiling water etc. just like the instruction says .
I almost never wear this, I thought the chain would be longer and it would hang a bit on my neck and chest but it doesn't. The chain is super short and I'd invest in something to lengthen if I serious wanted to wear this necklace. It is pretty and looks nice but unless you have a tiny neck, it chokes you .
I love this necklace. It is the prefect length (the design maybe on a the small size, just another centimeter bigger for me but still fine) and it is so beautiful. I get complimented on it all the time. I paid so little for something so gorgeous, people can't believe it. I would highly recommend this as a special occasion or just day to day necklace .
I usually order boots half a size up and did for this but could have probably ordered my regular size shoe with the wide calves option. They are a bit big but they fit well in the calves which is where I usually have trouble getting boots to fit. There isn't my size with wide calves to order anymore so I think I'll keep the boots and now I can wear fluffy, warm socks with them. I think they are even going to fit with leggings or tights, perhaps even jeans so that is well worth keeping. They seem to be pretty warm so I'll appreciate that as the days continue to get colder. Overall, I'm happy and keeping the boots even if I did order them a bit big .
I wanted some canvas shoes to try painting on and this was a pretty cheap pair in case I messed up. The painting went marvelously so now I wear these shoes all the time. They don't have the greatest arch support so if I spend a lot of the day on my feet and I can definitely feel it but the shoes are comfy enough otherwise. I've had them about a month and no problems otherwise .
I had it for about a year and then it crashed, on the market for a different external hard drive. I won't be buying Seagate ever again. It worked well enough for the year I had it but it recently crashed on me and won't be recognized by my computer. It started blinking and making noises, beeping and such and I lost a lot of data .
I wasn't quite sure what to expect with the ring. Over all the band is a slightly thinner than expected and the infinity sign is a bit smaller than I maybe thought it was but it is still very pretty.It arrived earlier than expected, than the delivery date which was super awesome! The sizing is perfect too, exactly what I wanted. I will definitely be wearing this all the time .
I muddled through the reviews, trying to figure out sizing and got it wrong. I got the White Pu and I ordered half a size small (something else apparently runs large) and it is a small tight fit for me. I can still wear them but I'm going to need to build up some calluses. Besides that though, they are really cute and for a low price, you can't beat it .
If I'd known all the problems I was going to have with this computer, I would have chosen something else. I've had it less than a year and I've called technical support at least a dozen times, mostly for the same problem. Less than a month after I got this computer, I started having trouble with the internet connection. I know that it has absolutely nothing to do with my routers because my ipod doesn't have problems and my roommate doesn't have problems, it's this laptop. For a while, every time I put my computer to sleep, it wouldn't connect to the Internet when I woke it back up. I couldn't even get to choose networks, I would click and click on the network button and nothing would happen. The only way I could reconnect to the Internet was restarting the entire thing. I called and called the technical support and they couldn't do a thing about it. They would send my on wild goose chases that always involved restarting my computer and thus call it fixed when it wasn't. I did an entire restore back to factory setting where I had to reinstall all my programs and now the problem happens every ten times I put my laptop to sleep or so. This is such a huge problem for me that it outweighs all the things I like about this computer.I like the touch screen, it's pretty awesome. I have gotten used to Windows 8 and I don't think it is bad. I don't like that there isn't a CD drive on the laptop, so I can't put in any of my DVDs/Blu-Rays or install any of my old games that come from CDs. It's thin and light weight, but I'd give that up for a CD drive. This laptop seemed like it would be incredibly awesome when I bought but I'm honestly going to be in the market for a new one in the next year (And NOT another ASUS). My previous laptop lasted over 4 years before the LCD screen started fading out. This one I just don't like .
I love these shoes! They are super cute and comfortable. They keep my feet warm all day. The bottoms for the boots were a bit slippery when I first got them but that went away after a couple of days of walking on them. They fit perfectly. I wear an 8 normally and these fit great over socks or tights. For just a low price, you can't go wrong with these boots. I might have to look into getting another pair in a different color .
Excellent size - not to big & doesn't take up alot of space. Nice black finish on it - I would recommend .
The cover itself is nice. Good quality and all the slots/holes in the right place for the 8.9&#34; Kindle HD but it does not sit up well as shown in pix. I actually to not know how they got it to do that for the pix .
The product came with a thin crack in the glass jar.  Unfortunately I was not able to return it for a replacement and need to return it for a refund and then re-order.  This is a slightly annoying hassle and because the purchase alone doesn't qualify for free shipping I will need to pay for shipping for the replacement order.Otherwise, it looks really good.  I don't want to drop the squirrel on my foot, it is nice and heavy duty.  I was picturing a smaller device, I'd say he is about 8-9&#34; tall and 4&#34; in diameter.  The jar has graded measurements to make it easy to only grind the right amount for the recipe .
We just bought this cable, and today tried to get it to work. It will plug in just fine and will NOT display the screen no matter what we tried. It is going out with the trash tonight. Complete POS .
It ended up melting in my laptop a few days after buying it. Not sure if our laptop has internal issues, or if it is the quality of charger. The amps were correct, so that wasn't it .
I won this product in a giveaway, and was super excited to receive and try this product!! Installation is easy, fits very well, and the material alone is so soft. It is so comfortable my son was really enjoying his ride around the mall last weekend in true comfort, which most strollers alone cannot provide. It is made of memory foam. I would recommend this to all moms. Our children deserve a product like this, and the price is very reasonable .
This set is the number one bolt extracting set, I would count on nothing else.Trust Irwin Industrial tools. yeah buddy .
these bits are really soft, with just ample pressure applied the bit broke right in half. I would not get these again .
This clip works just fine, has a lot of durability to it and this price was extremely low it's hard not to buy this .
I refure to this book often.  I don't know what else I can say about this book, but it's a very good referents book as I research different guns .
I think we will like this item.  But I haven't needed them yet and hopefully won't, but I would rather have them and not need them than not have THEM AND NEED THEM .
I have not had a chance to use my new saw, but I'm sure it will be a lot easier to use than my old skill saw is.  When it warms up and I'm able to get out side we'll see how well it works .
good product not the higest quality rubber, but not an expensive item either. I but this on my Kimber Custon II with some VZ grips and it looks great and keeps my fingers inplace. Not a bad option for 1911's with non serated front straps. I perfer this option over putting skateboard tape on my guns .
I have to say I' love KDLINKS. It plays every format includingMP4, MKV, AVI, TSO, M2TS.I'll begin by saying I was able to connect to Kdlinks wirelessly and it was relatively easy. I may one day test the wireless/streaming using a NAS but not now. I know other co workers who are successfully streaming with a NAS. I do want to note KDlinks has both both wireless and wired abilities.The way I use my media player is to run my USB hard drive off of it to watch movies and shows. I could not be happier with this product .
This was my 3rd yo yo. First, I got the maverick, then the velocity, and then this. (It was meant just for fun, and I like collecting them now).. When the Fast arrived i was SO surprised by how long I could get this thing to sleep. They mean what they say when they say "Fast." I can get this thing to sleep for 2+ minutes. It's crazy, looking at some of these other reviews people are saying it has a "low sleep time" but for me it's the exact opposite. With a good throw this thing just keeps spinning for ever and ever it seems. That's the best thing about this yoyo, the sleep time. The material it's made out of is very cheap plastic, not very durable (but good enough for a $10 toy, what do you expect?) It also makes this "whizzz" noise when you throw it. Kinda annoying, no big deal though, actually sounds kind of cool. If i'm around anyone and it's annoying them I'll just switch to the velocity.I never use the Mav anymore. Peice o' crap. In all honesty this thing sleeps longer then my velocity. The velocity goes about 45 sec while this goes 2+ minutes. Still, I love the velocity, feels better, plays better, -- the interchangable response to unresponsive on this yo yo sucks. Just keep it responsive, seriously, the whole yo yo will just fall apart if you put it on unresponsive and don't watch out.Pros: - LONG sleep time- Butterfly shape- Good price- Interchangeable from response to - unresponsive - works good.Neutrals: - Not very durable, cheap plastic- Whizz noiseCons - When you put this thing on unresponsive, if you are not carfeful and check every 5 or so throws the whole thing will come apart. Kinda disappointing since I am just now getting into unresponsive play. But that's why I got the velocity... The velocity is much better in this aspect.- Eats through strings faster then other yo-yo's .
Well first off I bought these Kava capsules from the "Kratom-K" and not mood&mind.; I received my shipment FAST and it included samples of their "featured" product. -- The kava was very good quality, I took a little out of one of the capsules and poured it on my tongue. Instantly I could feel my tongue going very numb. I could tell just from this it was high quality Kava, but as for the effects.. I took 10 capsules last night and within 30 minutes or so I could feel the anxiety relief and overall "chillness". Feeling lasted about 2-3 hours and reminded me of a mixture between alcohol and prescription anti-anxiety meds.Recommended... Not a bad product at all and at a good price. I was also pleased with the sample they sent me. Good Seller and good product. I'm happy.^ And to the goon who was looking for something like vicozen.. try looking elsewhere. Vicozen does not contain Kava and thus would not be the same thing.Look into Kratom, friend .
After playing approx 200 games at advanced, I was 10 games up.  the computer then won 20 straight games.  Over 75 % of its hands were greater than 14 pts.  never a hand less than 8.  Conversely in the same period over 90% of my hands were 8 or less with cribs of less than 6 pts.  Care to calculate tbe odds.I'm done .
I read one review where someone said it did not come with instructions.May I remind you that,that's why they call it a puzzle.This is a nice little piece for a kid 5-10 yrs.Great starter for a future model builder .
this man is so honest and a god fearing man whats not to love. good job Phil let no one keep you down. We all make mistakes and he opened his heart and held nothing back.Loved it, him and family .
You are a wonderful author I can hardly tear myself away from this series. What love and despair. Emma has to be the strongest person yet confused. For someone who never had any guidance,or love. She has a lot to figure out. Can not wait till the next book. Keep up the good work. And I am looking forward to finding your books .
I love this book and had to have the next one these books are erotic. but i don't want to put them down. poor Sam she is so confused, and in love .
very good screen quality, excellent 3D interaction, the TV sound is a little low but the quality is excellent. not being a smart TV, it has some features that make it like, like automatic volume utomatico brilloa etc.. not much else to say, is a good TV I recommend it enough, so be it for video games, movies, cable TV, aplicacciones, navigation, etc .
I don't like the book I love it!!!!!!!!!!! :-) This book is awesome. LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS BOOK .
I loved this book!!!!! I mean Nikki is amazing. She is just  a sign that hearts are never perfect! I'm such a dork .
I love love love this book! Rachel Renee Reusel ( I think I spelled that wrong ^~^) makes such amazing writing! I can't help it! I'm such a dork! :- .
I love this book because  it gives you the classic fairytales and some you may have never even know it. I think everybody should read it .
Terrible options...no fun....don't botherI would have given it 0 stars but it makes you put one to post your review .
It was awesome but I wish the whole book was free but it's not I can only hope from neece .
The battery never worked, and the check was inflated. Has damaged, stole my money, I was charged shipping and also pay to bring the battery to Venezuela. I lost a lot of money for nothing. They are thieves.La bateria nunca funcion&oacute;, la revise y estaba inflada. Vino da&ntilde;ada, me robaron mi dinero, me cobraron envio y ademas pague para traer la bateria a Venezuela. Perdi mucho dinero por nada. Son unos ladrones .
Just a book that can't forget in your life&#932;&#941;&#955;&#949;&#953;&#959; &#946;&#953;&#946;&#955;&#943;&#959; &#945;&#960;&#959; &#941;&#957;&#945;&#957; &#941;&#955;&#955;&#951;&#957;&#945; !The health of the life .
not packaged correctly.  looked like it had been run over by a truckI thought it was a hardback. It was a paperback.  Not as represented .
Does the job, use pistol scope and not a regular one like I did, ended up returning the scope, but do know you will have to shave it down a little at the front if you are wanting to attach it. if you don't want to do that remove one star, but after I did that it attached and when I fired with it did not budge on the Mosin and held it zero, or as zero as it could be with a novice shooter, was getting 6 inch groups and getting smaller, smallest was 3-4 in with one flyer due to user error. Stable and effective mount if you do a lil gunsmithing 4 stars, if you don't want to do the extra shaving off take off a star .
The recoil pad shows a significant difference, I have Mosin 91/30 hex with its original steel butt pad and that thing kicks me like an angry female. All joking aside, the recoil felt is reduced to about 1/6 of the original, it still punches good, but now if you accidentally positioned it on bone, it won't ruin half your day like the original steel butt-pad that would've come close to chipping any bone it is in contact with then you shoot. BUT the stripper clips on the other hand do work but compared to the original Russian stripper clips that I've got, they're useless . If you already got Russian stripper clips or were planing to buy them do not factor getting these clips with the recoil pad, but when i bought this it was $15 dollars total with shipping. If you would buy these separate it would be 10 for the recoil pad and  5 with the clips and shipping has not yet been factored in. Other than that butt pad is great product, clips have much to be desired .
the product was not what i expected it sheds the same day i got it and its thin so that mean theres barely any hair left on the wig.please do better .
It is a good story about the trials and tribulations of weddings and all the emotions it brings to the surface. Pulls at your heartstrings following the journal of wedding plans by a mother who knew she would not be there .
It looks like an earring. I was expecting big but it just looks awkward and its not like my nose is really small either. I really don't want to pay shipping back to the seller so I guess since it came with two, I have a new set of earrings .
I completely regret buying this. I first got them and I was super excited to have new belly rings and then they kept breaking! Id wear them for maybe 2 days and the plastic balls would crumble. I highly suggest you don't buy this product .
I put it in and loved it but the captive was really hard to put in/take out. I slept with it in thinking it would be fine because i've slept with nose hoops in before but when I woke up the captive was gone. I don't know whether that was my fault or the way it was made but I don't think ill be buying another captive hoop again .
This book is such a great addition to the first.  It delves deeper into the story and parts are so emotionally moving you can't help but cry or laugh with joy. This book should be on everyones shelf along with the other 2 books .
This last book of the trilogy is absolutely enthralling. The ending of the three books is not how you'd expect and very captivating. There are learning lessons in each book of determination, strength,  compassion,  and will.  I believe this book is for all ages .
This book and the rest of the trilogy is absolutely fascinating and so well written. The characters are unique and extremely enjoyable.  My daughter also read this story and fell in love with it.  It is a good read no matter the age .
I'm really excited about my stand. It holds up my heavy books no problem and I can easily turn pages .
I really enjoyed the two seasons and disappointed there were no more seasons. I love the shows from BBC.  Keep them coming .
Great information.  Always looking in the sky for streams that do not  disappear.I use Amazon for most of my buys .
No problems whatsoever.  I am in love with them.  I bought them for used as leggings; however, not made for it but keeps my legs warm .
No problem with this product.Works as mentioned in the description, and I am sold on the product. Thank you .
I have used TurboTax for years and enjoy the product.  This product is for any one who is afraid to do your own taxes but afraid you are going to make a mistakes. Guess what, computers make mistakes by individual not checking themselves.I would recommend this product to everyone .
The reviews I read indicated that these shirts are a FULL large size and do not shrink. I tried them on and still fit a bit snug. Oh well, time to drop a few pounds anyway .
This is. Way too hard to put together and very cheap...  Wouldn't recommend for anyone, especially anyone under 15 and why would someone that old want this .
If you are looking for the cinderella/princess look, this slip is for you. First let me say, we looked and looked for a slip that would do justice to my daughters wedding dress. The bridal shop actually sold me a slip that they thought would work with the dress. I knew it wasn't right. I found this slip, ordered it, and had it two days later. Literally, this slip SAVED THE DRESS! My daughters dress went from drab to FAB! I was shocked when it arrived in a box because it is so full. the crinoline starts at the waist as described. It actually ended up being too full for our dress, so I took scissors and cut out two layers of crinoline. Within about 10 minutes, it was the perfect fit!It you need a full slip...ORDER THIS ONE .
It worked amazing!! To prevent the jewels falling off i coated it with clear nail polish! The case isn't bulky and it is great! Very worth the 10 .
I chose this rating because I was unable to use this item. I would recommend this item to anyone who is able to pick up the digital channels in their area. Sorry I did not research this first .
I chose this rating because I was so disappointed that I could not pick up one channel with this unit. I think that you should let consumers know that this item is non-returnable before they order this item. I would never have ordered this converter box if I had known, however, shopping at amazon is such an enjoyable experience .
This book is by far one of the best books I have read about Christian faith.  This woman's testimony is incredible and yet remains not preachy, which sometimes happens in these type of books.  The beginning may seem a little cumbersome (or maybe just to me), because it contained names of places I was unfamiliar with, but it all becomes clearer and frankly, I just didn't worry about each place because she explains where she is and what is going on through-out the book.  This is definitely one you will want to keep for your library .
Love this chair, easily adjustable and comfy seat.  Rolls very easily but not so much that the chair rolls away from you.  I would highly recommend this chair to all. Many thanks .
Highly recommend this mattress protecter to all.  I was worried that it might make some noise and not breath but its good quality and breathes.  Very happy, thanks .
Although I did not buy this keychain to play with, I think it is very fun. I love yoshi. However , thank god i bought a second one because his body fell off at the neck. This keychain lasted me no more than a week .
This is not the same product that came with the steam cleaner.  Didn't realize when i ordered. Feel i was somewhat misled with this product.  Original is easier to use on the floor, and picks up more dirt.  This one doesn't glide as smoothly unless it it saturated .  I believe cost of the &#34;real&#34; pad is well worth it. Probably won't use again .
It claims to fit 24x36 foam core, but not very easily.  I would recommend next larger size if your planning to fit 24x36 anything .
t-shirt is not as high a V-neck as it was supposed to be, but they are still better than most .
Rides the but line.chose the boy short so this would not happen. But did anyways. Cannot wear with pants. Looks like a panty line .
The wrap held cold a long time.  Did not like the empty spot over the kneecap as wanted to ice that too.  It was probably meant to enable walking while icing .
It's my understanding that this is the first "thriller" written by this author. Considering that, it is very well done. The writing is compelling, and the plot believable and interesting. Although the dialogue sometimes falters and is not realistic, the characters are well-developed and the reader easily forges bonds with the main characters. Over all, a good read .
I purchased this knife because my other Kershaw was a bit too large to carry all the time.This one is the perfect size and doesn't really show clipped in your pocket. It's very well made and quick to open .
No more fighting for a charger port! This unit has been performing excellently for many months, unlike the previous one (different design, model and manufacturer - bought at Wal-Mart).My ONLY let-down is the USB port will not charge certain cell phones - eg iPhone 4 - but it does charge my MP3 so I can ride with my jams - lol .
This costume came in good condition and fit well. It came with the dress and the hat. I will say that the hat was really tiny and doesn't just fit on your head and stay there, so you'll have to pin it in your hair with bobby pins but its not a big deal. The other thing is that its veryyyy tight and kinda unforgiving. I wore spandex under mine and you could see the spandex hem through the dress because its so tight. But if you're okay with that I would suggest buying your regular size. I'm like 5'2&#34; and 105 pounds and so I got the extra small. Its tight but I think that's how it's suppose to fit, it still looks good. Also the length was perfect. I wore it out Halloween weekend to a few parties and got a lot of complements and guys would come up and tell me how cute/sexy/awesome my costume was so I was pretty happy with it. Overall, I think it was a good buy .
When I bought this I sort of expected it to be really poor quality makeup because it's such low price. However, I think the quality is pretty decent, and all the colors are really great for trying new things with makeup.It's not amazing, but very decent for the price .
Pretty nice product! Too bad it's not in 3D or air brushed onto hard shell! Overall pretty satisfied!It was a gift to a relative who happens to have the same engine in his car therefore he really likes it .
The storyline is top notch! The characters and their background progression is awesome! I love this show and will never stop watching .
I am no pro when it comes to golf. I have a slice which has gotten a bit better before the club, but now it has straightened out. I am still trying to play with the draw and fade. I bought it from Tomball Golf and the service was excellent. Great price free shipping and fast responses to my questions .
An excellent youth bow, my daughter loves it. It did not include information about how to adjust the draw tension, which would have helpful. Overall, a great product .
Very awesome game, a must buy if you played the original on gamecube. This game is also great for any one who never got the chance, can now experience this adventure in full high definition glory .
The Slyvania H7 EcoBright bulb works as intended, although not very bright but I already figured that since they were eco friendly etc .
Very good quality...Works perfect.. the only bad thing it that its kinda big so it doesn't fit in my mother's truck.. other than that it's very helpful.. by the way the color is beautiful .
Really great buy, it's light and it has grip. Money well spent. If your battery dies fast buy this case will not regret it .
I was introduced to Delain via Internet radio and fell in love with them!  Their music is inspiring and deep at the same time with Charlotte's powerful vocals and arrangement of music.  I also loved watching the DVD included with this album.  I can't watch it on my home DVD player, but I can on my laptop.  I can't wait for their next album .
My daughter cannot get enough of this movie, I don't like the movie but as long as my daughter's happy and likes the movie I'm happy too .
This is such a pointless game to have, I don't even know why it's called a game. Not worth downloading .
I don't like this game! I think it's so pointless, but my daughter thinks it's just the best game ever. Not worth getting .
This is game is not worth downloading!! It shouldn't't be called a game it is just so pointless to download .
The boat is good but the oars are cheap. Handles came off the first day. Not sure I would purchase again .
I couldn't find an ACU pattern carrier that held the size bladder I wanted, so Multicam was the next best thing. I got this for my Army IOTV. It has more molle than the IOTV, but I was able to make it fit very securely. It is made of very durable material, and I'm happy with the multicam molle leaving no gaps between the camo pattern. I purchased the Condor bladder along with this, and it fits perfectly .
Hard lol  but pretty fun. Really wish you could either get more coins with each word or that the hints didn't cost so many .
No problems and arrived early, Good quality. So far so good and expecting a long life. Would recommend to anyone .
It does the job. Kinda bulky. Doesn't fit in tight spots. Must have plenty of room on the walker or chair .
i was curious if this was just another dim light, but i was very surprised when i turned it on and i lit up the entire cab of my big rig work truck. i love it. i have quit a bit of paper work to to in the early morning darkness. my truck light just doesn't cut it. this little light adds enough light to get the job done. money well spent .
These are the most comfortable, well fitting, useful headphones I have used today. I would highly recommend these earphones. You can wear them all day long and they do not hurt your ears, and they will not fall out of your ears at any time while you're working or working out. I give these a strong two thumbs up and a circle around the world snap .
This case makes 6 in our family. I've bought them for gifts and not one complaint. Not A better case around. Fits your hand and has taken some falls( without a case the phone would not have survived, I know because I lost my1st caseless iphone to a small drop, And it shattered.). Never hesitate, I use several of the screen protectors and dash hangers...everything rockform is GREAT! 100% satisfied customer .
I just couldn't live without this app. It's so simple and convenient to use. Check balance, make transfers, view past statements, bill pay. The list goes on. I use this 2,3,or 4 times a day. Great banking tool. love it .
I had high hopes for these cables when I first bought them. However, the first one stop working three days after I started using it. The other two fell apart within the following three weeks.Do Not waste your time or money buying these cables .
If you are into E cigarettes and want to have access to some terrific deals and low prices this is the app that will get you there. Nothing is sold on this site but this is the site that gives you information where the deals are. I have saved tons of money with the information given on the site. Very easy to read and understand and use. I visit this site at least three times a day sometimes six or seven times a day .
I have loved these since the first time I used em... and now I don't have to buy any for a VERY long time, don't have any excuse for not having a clean place!  ;P .
Very good read.  The only thing I did not like was just as I was getting into it, It ended, then I had to buy another one. I would recommend this book highly .
Really liked this book,could not put it down until I was finished with it. Good read. I would recommend this book to my family and friends to read .
I got this book because I liked all the books that Tressie Lockwood. I cannot wait to find more of her books to read.Thanks. I would recommend this book to my friends and family members as well .
I enjoyed the books very much. Can't wait to get number 4.It would've been nice if it was one book. I give it 4 stars .
The reason I chose this book is I got the first one for free, and I could not put it down, and I could not wait for the next one, and the next, which lead me to this book. Which I thoroughly enjoyed, and wanted to read more. Can't wait for number 5. I would recommend it to my friends .
Not a bad read. I liked the way the author kept the story line flowing .I would recommend this book .
Had to decipher the book.Too short a book.I don't think that I would pay another $2.99 for the next book. Not a bad story line,but need to be proof read before the next book is ready for printing. Also the other caurator language need to speak better English .
Very good read. I wish it wasn't such a short book. I cannot wait for the next book to be released. I hope it is longer than the past 3 books. I would recommend this book to my family and friends to read .
Choose this rating because it was a good book to read.Can't wait for the next book witch it will be out very soon. I would recommend this book to my family and friends to read .
These were nice, very good color. I don't know why other people thought they were too small. They have good size, my girlfriend loved them .
I purchased this and received it a couple days ago. I just got around to installing it today due to work and school. I turn the computer on after installation and I get errors, the computer won't finish starting up. So I restart it a few times & it finally starts up and works for about an hour. I go do something else for a little while and when I come back, I have the errors again with the blue screen of death up. I tried reseating the RAM, nothing but errors still. So I put the old RAM back in and it starts back up just fine and works just fine, but slow since it was only 512MB of RAM originally. Needless to say I will be returning this and will never purchase anything that comes from KomputerBay again.As usual Amazon is awesome, the product was shipped quickly and arrived in a couple days .
I gave this as a Christmas present, he loved it. The t-shirt was good quality, not something cheap, it should last quite a while .
I sent this to someone for Christmas present, he loved it, thought it was hilarious. Couldn't have asked for a better product =- .
I got this book to cross reference with Chilton Repair Manual.  Everywhere I went wanted to order it for me for upwards of $20 to $24 and I got it here for FOUR BUCK :)  not new of course but really, it's serving its purpose.Thanks .
I watched lots of reviews on YouTube about these tips and everyone said they were awesome.  Alas, they were not.I got these tips for my Klipsch Image S4's (the stock ear tips sound and feel great but have a tendancey to come off and get stuck in my ear...ikr...wtf...?)...anyway...these Comply tips are not soft at all...they're pliable...but not soft.  They don't feel good and take waaay too long to conform after "squishing" them down to insert in your ear.  I never even gave them time to sound good (if they actually did) because they were so uncomfortable in my ear.  I wear my earbuds for a couple of hours at a time at the gym and when I'm out and about doing stuff so the first priority for me is comfort. I've had cheap $10 throw-away ear buds that felt better than these tips.OK I guess you get the point.btw...when I went back to the video reviews I noticed in every one the reviewer said that Comply "sent" these to them for review so I'm guessing they probably didn't pay for them in exchange for giving a good review...i'm jus sayin' ...Don't waste you money on these .
Its not a traditional touchscreen (the screen it self is not where the touch capability is at)  They should have left out the touchscreen all together because it's absolutely useless and very slow reaction time.  The touchscreen is below the screen on the black part and does nothing that a 4-way toggle wouldn't have done and the toggle would have been much more reactive and easier to use.The User Interphase is absolutely awful...syncing music is the worst. I came from a Creative Zen UI which is a simple drag & drop. For the life of me, I don't know why they couldn't do the same.It has very little personalization choices so when finishing a playlist you can't just go back to playlists...you have to go all the way back to the beginning, go through the entire menu just to get back to your playlists.I gave this 2 stars only because I haven't had any technical issues with it (not playing or freezing up).I've never been an Apple man but my next purchase with be the Nano 7th Gen.  I'll be so happy to put this one away for emergency purposes only .
I did away with cable and have a pc beside my 42&#34; Plasma TV (using it as the monitor).  This cable works great.  The price was a fraction of everybodys in-store price.  Just add a 1/8 inch audio connector and I'm in like Flint. :]Note:  If you decide to do this, be sure it's an SVGA cable and not just a VGA cable.  The svga is required for any HD signal .
The B&N store doesn't have as much to offer as android market for kindle.  Nice reader. My 11 year old reads constantly and it's so much easier to keep track of then the 3 or 4 books he's reading at that time .
I loved the style and colors of this shirt, however, with it being a "one-size" it was "gaping" around the chest area, and was quite baggy in the front.  I'm 5'6" and approx. 140 lbs and was within the size range but it did not fit at all.  I was not able to wear it to the halloween party I ordered it for so had to find something else last minute .
I purchased this as a gift for my husband and he loves it. It's been a while now and we've had no issues .
Thais is a bad shoe and this picture does nothing for it. I fell in love as soon as I opened the box .
I don't know if we were stuffing it too much or now but it tore open after just a few months .
It doesn't look exactly like the shoe but I figured I would make it work. It has a different feel that could just take getting use to .
The dress is made out of great material but the top was cut a little to big. My boobs are average size abad they were literally popping out of the dress. The dress was a medium and I don't think I can go down any smaller. Although I don't think that would help the situation .
I guess Slim Fit Jeans are meant for Skinny People? Quality was perfect, they just didn't fit! I plan on reordering a different style .
This was horrible. Every picture ive taken since i inserted the memory card has been damaged. I take a picture and go back to look at it and instantly its corrupted. It does not have 32 gb worth of space. They did reimburse my money but don't even go through the hassle .
Much better than the movie...a must read if you're a fan! Can't wait to read part 2! A great plot and excitement in every chapter .
As good as the first novel! I can't wait to read more books written by Michael. Hopefully they are just as good .
I love this book, so much that it is my now go-to baby shower gift for all my new mom friends. While this book mostly tells me everything I'm already observing in my now 5 month old baby, it makes me feel sane. So far, my child has followed the wonder weeks pretty closely, exhibiting the fussy signs with each approaching wonder week. Every time my child has gone through a fussy period leading up to a &#34;leap,&#34; I read the appropriate chapter of this book nightly to remind myself that while my kid may currently be fussy and a little hard to handle, something really cool is about to happen.I highly recommend this book, not necessarily for groundbreaking information, but to really help the first time mom (or the mom who forgets what it's like having a newborn/infant!) not feel so crazy .
at least I know the temperature is right!I purchased this thermometer because my newborn baby hated taking baths and I got concerned I was making the bath too hot or too cold, when what I was looking for was Goldilocks's &#34;just right.&#34; This thermometer has been very helpful in ensuring I have the right temperature and that's not the reason my baby hates baths!Overall, I would recommend this product .
This is a good product: the ribbon is strong and cuts well, meaning it didn't really fray. I'm giving four stars instead of five because the ribbon is a little darker than I would have anticipated/like for a navy. It looks almost black .
I use this mat to help protect my 5 month old from those spills he takes while trying to learn to sit, crawl, and other baby things :)  It's enough to cushion his fall so that he doesn't cry (except maybe from surprise!).It's very easy to clean: I vacuum it with my Dyson Animal (rollers turned off) and then wipe down with a vinegar and water solution. The only minor problem is that when my cat walks over it, sometimes her nails cause little holes, though I'm sure I'd have this problem with any mat.Overall, I highly recommend .
There was a span of about a month when my husband and I would take nightly drives to calm down our colicky newborn and get him to sleep. We thought, &#34;Hey, look at this calming center! Maybe it mimics the car's vibrations and we won't need to waste all that gas!&#34; Well, we thought wrong. I think this scared our newborn more than anything.So, with that said, it seems well made and maybe it works for some people. It just didn't work for us .
These are great. I mean, superhero leggings? What could be better?My five month old seems comfortable wearing these and they make diaper changes a breeze. He's not crawling yet but I think these will be great when he does start .
Too wobbly. figures fall out of their chairs and tea set tumbles off the table. Disappointed little girl who couldn't wait to play with this gift .
A GPS for Your RetirementLet's face it, not all of us want to think about retirement but the age old expression is `to be forewarned is to be forearmed', especially when it comes to our finances! This book has shown me, that you can't really put off the inevitable and really do need to financially plan ahead.A GPS for Your Retirement by Ken Mahoney, provides an excellent insight to everything you need to know about you financial future.  The author manages to take you through the steps of investing in easy and methodical steps, without being dull.  So if like me, you didn't really have a clue about investments, you will be very pleased to hear that I found this book very well written and easy to follow.I actually found myself enjoying this book and feel much more confident about how to plan financially for my own retirement and make the most of the assets I have.  To be honest you really cannot afford not to read this book .
With the Author Charles Ho's, personal experience as a professional chef and hotelier, he makes this book a very easy to understand marketing guide for the restaurant business.  Each of the 7 proven marketing strategies are broken down into straightforward steps, making the book an interesting and logical read.You will end up thinking like I did `why didn't I think of that?' so many times.  It really has given me some great ideas, inspiration, for inexpensive ways to have an instant impact on business such as `mobile marketing'.  As we know most people these days have a mobile phone and will read a message `within a 5 minute time period of it being received'.  This access, direct to potential customers is invaluable and the book shows ways of setting this up at a low cost.I found the section on restaurant websites indeed very interesting, the author states, as most people go on a restaurant website to look at a full menu and if there isn't one or your menu is out of date, this could potentially lose you custom.  This is remarkably true, as I know from personally doing this myself!This book in my opinion is invaluable for anyone thinking of starting their own restaurant in today's climate.  Even if you already own a restaurant business and you are looking for ways to improve your popularity, reputation and revenue, then I can highly recommend this easy to read marketing guide .
I currently have 12 credit cards and three $20.00 dollar bills in my wallet. more room then was advertised. The wallet does not bother me when I carry it in my rear pocket  like my old wallet did .
I was hesitant to try this because not all pens are created equal and I already have my favorite. But I love this pen it makes writing note so much easier and so far it hasn't skipped which is a good thing. This is quickly becoming one of my go to pens.*This product was sent to me by Influenster and Pilot. I did not spend my own money on it and my opinion is my own .
We got them for our six year old son and he loves them. I only thing I didn't like is how long it took to get here .
I never thought I would enjoy a book as much as I enjoyed this.I was happy, sad, confused, and totally entertained all  at the same time.  What  a delightful  find for my new kindle!!!!! Can't wait to read more .
This is a very enjoyable read.  You can imagine what life was really like in days past.  Cannot imagine having to live under those conditions .
wow love this case the best I ever have, very easy to put on ,and it hold on your  belt proper does not move .
Diane this was a Amazing story! I am not much of a reader,but this story kept my interest until the end! Diane is one Amazing,strong women.this story about her life&lost is a Must read! Thanks for sharing your story .
I haven't used this enough to really assess the lifetime compared to the camera's original, but all signs point to it being a very good battery. It is very difficult to find a quality product at such a good price .
Easy to put on, comes with all the tools needed for a flawless application. High quality, stiff, super clear plastic protection. Will wear doen your stylus tip faster. Someone needs to mention that diamond doesn't indicate clarity, rather its sparkly like a 4 yr olds first art project. had to return for a sparkle free version. return went easy .
Did not fit, had to return. Felt cheap, returned easily enough. Go check out cases at Best Buy or something before purchasing online. You hold this in your hands, so its got to feel good .
Now I am completely hooked on the series. I could not put this book down. I highly recommend it and the others of the series .
This pedal works great. It was a little confusing at first what the difference between every Ernie Ball VP was but I finally understood and got the right one and it's perfect. I Usually keep my foot on the volume pedal(most of the time at least) and it's pretty durable. Haven't had problems with the strings breaking yet .
This case definitely deserves a 5 star rating. It has everything every nexus owner wants. It has a lightweight frame and slim profile, a stand that actually stays in the grooves, and a fit thats perfect. The price is fair. What else do people want? I have no problems with it, including the clips which I thought were gonna be the problem. No problems equals perfect rating .
i bought this panda for THON weekend at Penn State [...]and not only did it survive the weekend with my friend who was dancing, but it was also the most popular toy around. people thought it was a dog at a glance! the previous reviews about the legs not holding are probably because they did not fill it with helium. it's feet were perfectly weighed so it hovered about the ground. would definitely get this again! so many compliments .
Loved, loved, loved this book!  I laughed, cried, and was shocked how it ended.  That is the only bad thing I can say is, now I have to wait for the next one!  Not fair .
Loved the story and it wasn't filled with sex.  Just a love story worth reading.Had mystery, suspense, romance, the whole thing.  Would definately recommend .
What a wonderfully written book, loved every minute of it!Great characters and loved that it ended, but the story can continue, no cliff hanger.  Can't wait to read on, and see where it all goes .
Loved this story, the characters were easy to root for.  The evil step mom gets what's coming to her,just loved it!Easy writing style, detailed but not over the top .
Loved thus book, couldn't put it down.  Fell in love with the lovable characters, great writing can't wait for more!  Fabulous .
What a beautifully written love story.  Loved the characters and how they complimented each other.  The story flowed and there was never a dull moment  in the book.  Another  wonderful book by J.M. Seville .
This was one if my favorite books!  I went through every emotion and back again.  I cried Luke a baby at the end but smiled also.  I can't believe I am saying this because I am not a fan of sequels, but this is a book I would love more of .
This book was recommended by another author.  I am so grateful for the recommendation, I loved this story.  It's not something I thought I would be interested in but wow, loved it!Great characters, funny, loving, just fabulous!  I would recommend this book to everyone.  There is something for everyone.  Can't wait to read  it again .
I love anything written by Belle.  She is a truly amazing author.  I loved this story and the characters.  The story just draws you in and you can't get enough .
Wore the top once and it shrunk to the point I can't wear it any more.  Would not recommend buying .
Loved this book!  Great story,Solid characters, laughed out loud.  The book had it all.  Definitely a must read, you will not be able to put it down .
This is by far one of my all time favorite series.  It is not a feel good series,It had a lot of very intense interactions.  I c .
After seeing a brief review of this book in the paper, I picked out this book for myself (an upper-30-ish-something) because it looked intriguing.  I was not disappointed!  It was a fun, well-written story from page one; one of those stories you just can't stop reading, even as sleep time comes and goes.  I enjoyed the characters, the storyline, and the pace.  My teenagers will love it, and I think my younger kids will like it when they're older.  There are themes and ideas that are not for the younger reader (losing parents, battle, injury), as well as some humor that would best be for the age group it's intended for or above.  I have read books one and two and am anxiously waiting for book three.  The only thing disappointing is that it is only a trilogy, as I will want more!  If you like adventure, magical, interesting, fun or just plain good stories, then you will like this book .
Excellent book!!  Well written, quick moving, page-turning.  I didn't expect to like it as much as I did, and I ended up not being able to put it down.  Looking very forward to the next book .
I opened the box, plugged in the ice shaver, and shaved some ice. After I tried the second time, the inner mechanism broke and won't shave ice anymore .
This pair of jeans was exactly what I was looking for in a &#34;Skinny Jean&#34;.  Didn't want anything that was &#34;flashy, teenie-bopper&#34;, party-type jean,... but wanted something I could wear out to by grocery or dress-up for night-time.  Also, wanted comfort, yet wanted to maintain the &#34;jean-look&#34; (not jeggings).  These jeans met all my expectations and more.  I'm a relatively tall (5'7&#34;), middle-aged woman (47) and I work to stay in shape.  These jeans help me to emphasize that in a modest and stylish manner .
I was not pleased with the wig, it didn't look anything like the picture.  The length was too long, passed my shoulder's .
I purchased this same wig 3 months ago and was very pleased with the wig, so decided to purchase a 2nd wig.  I was not pleased with the 2nd wig.  The wig was defective, it was unevenly cut, and didn't fit on my head properly.  I will not purchase anymore wigs from this manufacturer .
I was not pleased with the wig, it had a foul odor and didn't look anything like the picture.  I would not purchase anything else from this manufacturer .
I am very happy with the Dualcomm deca-100 I purchased.  The only issue I had was keeping the Cat-5 cables as short as possible, and they didn't work with my managed Dell switch.  So I just put one of my inexpensive Netgear switches in the middle and now it works great.  Since I don't think many people have managed Dell switches in their homes they shouldn't run into the problem.  And concerning the short Cat-5 issue, just extend the coax to cover the distance .
Excellent character development, plot was real and gripping, fast paced, plausible see, and could not put it down! A must read. A lot of sex .
This book was a slow starting can't put it down stairs up till 3am read that drew me in and totally enrolled me. And I'm not a vampire fan, never read the genre. Download it by accident but now want y to find and red the sequel. The male human leads aren't as "fleshed out" (pun intended) as well as the vampire leads especially the main protagonist...but everyone starts somewhere, right? Worth reading...just don't plan on putting it down until your done .
Hyper stupid slow starting plot, poorly drawn characters, endless reputation of stupid but hot babe theme w frog make best friend who turns into a price of danger...insane explanations of so-called quantum physics and absolutely falls flat on so called political consultant that's overdrawn and irrelevant. End in middle of so called action sequence without resolution but I couldn't care less what happens next because it's so very predictable. Bad editing, spelling, grammar and coding so you missed everything from a proposition to an entire deterrence dropped from the page.Don't even bother...take a nap instead .
Very enticing read. Short but Alma takes great strides to draw you in so you feel as if your a sister not mentioned. Hiding in the shadows there with them. Highly recommended for a short read before bed to get your mind dream ready .
IMPORTANT!!!The color of plastic part of this caddy is not black but red, and one of my friends bought the same one and met the same problem. So If your laptop is totally black you may have to choose another one.For the quality, it just did what it should do. There's no functional difference between this caddy and others with 40 bucks. Furthermore, the screws  are also different from those in the photo. They are made by plastic. Fortunately I don't really need them because you can also get them from your optical drive .
i love these pliers! it really does what it promises to do. no need to waste money on other pliers! i recommended it to my sister who share my jewelry making hobby .
In my feedback I just mention it occurs bubble ,it may be because of I installed it improperly  . After that feedback Tech Armor gave new protection cover at no charge with installation guideline . I am using it from couple of moths its works good .  I liked it .
sanddisk 4GB memory card is a very good offer it help alot with a prepay phone so you can get things on yor phone and stoer that prepaid phones don't have .
Mario Kart Wii this game is so much fun don't miss out if your going to get Nintendo Wii get Mario Kart .
This company you have to wait a month for your product, then you get the 2pcs Bundle expecting the color white but you don't get white you get pink, so after waiting a month I just took the pink .
Remote Dog Training Collar It's really a great Collar, It's not expensive this is a good collar if you have a small Dog, this is what you want be it doen't vibrate or shock as strong it just let's the Dog know the dog is being correted .
Please never order from this company, I did I got the WII no games, I was getting a bundle WII and two games. and this company has no tracking # so you can't track your package it was not good. I gave them 4 star a little credit for the late WII that works.1 out of 5 is really bad .
The chargers are great no more spending money on batteries so this saves us alot of money I'm so glad I got  the dual chargers .
Service Dog Information Cards are very helpfulp you put with your dog, so when anyone doen't  the rules of a service dog, you can just pull out the card, and the card explains everything no question ask .
LG 900 Screen Protector easy to put on and it's very nice last a long time and protects as it says and no smudges .
This case is really nice it protects your phone really well and the Holster is really nice it never falls off I like it .
Fun game, kills time, raping zombies is never a bad thing. But it's always depressing when a game wants you to purchase additional items .
the color was not what was advertised and the material felt horrible. It was way too thin and the layering of the skirt looked bad .
Maybe I'm new to Ina's work. Everything she does is golden. My turn at the recipes I try in this book, tons of them, make my food come alive. Isn't that all that matters .
Giada must love her reflection or she wouldn't put her photo where we ought to see food. With that in mind, the food recipes themselves are great. Italian is my style and she's got what I'm looking for. I had trouble on one recipe but the rest are stable, not challenging. I ought to watch the scale go up tomorrow though! Been eating too much of her good old cooking. Yum-o .
No scratches and a great and original play. One of the best games I have ever played, even though it is very old .
I bought this thinking it would be really cool, but when I opened the package it was covered in hair, which is very gross. Also some of the keys aren't correctly painted. The K key also has a hole in it. It was all together a very bad buy, which I regret. I would advise you buy a decent product .
Smart protection for a smart phone. 24/7/365 days a year it is the best protector money can buy! Do not waste your time and money on other cases .
Was a gift for a child age 14 - never heard from the as to fun or not fun - so much for giving .
This is a Christmas present for my grand daughter so other than the appearance I cannot give a rating.  I will be glad to comment after I give the watch to her on or about Dec 25, 2013, thanks .
I love how she did not give up and was not going to let Phillip and his wife get away with this crime. I would recommend this book to everyone .
I did not like how I felt.  It just didn't agree with me. I have 3 kids and I felt like I had to eat just so I wouldn't have to yell at them! It was like I had a short fuse.  Sorry maybe it works for others but now I'm stuck with two new bottles I don't know what to do with .
Sure these pedals aren't that expensive Dura Ace and Ultegra, but the 105 pedals aren't that far behind. If you are not that person that likes the lightest stuff on the market. This is the pedal for you! These pedals came in the mail on time and neatly packed. These pedals are much better then the pedal+cage combo you can get for cheep. These pedals are very easy to clip in and out of and they rotate smoothly. I am very pleased with my purchase and I will use amazon again to buy my cycling gear .
I live in hawaii and it gets pretty hot on rides i usually take with my friends. We always make a run to 7-11 to refill our water bottles. All my friends don't have clipless pedals so they have no problem walking but i actually slipped and fell on my back before. After buying this product i dont really have to be carfull of slipping as much. This is well worth the money and i like it .
I have this controller from when it first came out (it was 60 dollars though). I still don't regret buying it for 60 even thought you can buy it for around 30. This controller is made for comfort and in game performance. This really helps on FPS games because the triggers are so easy to press so my trigger finger on pistols went up from the first time using it. I also like the lighting and the air coming out of the controller. It actually made me turn off the air for a hour because my hands got so cold. This is totally worth the money and I highly recommend this controller to people that play any game on xbox or ps3. Happy playing .
I was very happy with this product as I cannot get at any groc or box store in my area.  I felt the price was good and it was shipped to me very promptly .
I don't really write product reviews, but I will about this piece of crap. I bought this product mostly to watch movies and have as a disk drive for my current laptop. As a disk drive it works well and you can install programs and other things efficiently without much trouble; however my problem with this product is the dvd/movie aspect of the device. When you buy this item you are only entitled a 30 day trial to watch movies after which you have to pay another $50 to $60 to continuing using the dvd portion of this product. As I am writing this review the product is currently $30. But it should be explicitly stated that you only have dvd capability for a limited time. Why would that feature not be completely included? They should just tell people the truth that this product is actually $80 - $90 or at least be honest and tell people that certain features need to be unlocked!!! I feel like they robbed me and what's more other people reviewing the product don't mention this either. Maybe I'm the only person in the world who doesn't know a workaround this problem, but I wouldn't recommend this product unless you need a basic disk drive for a computer or laptop lacking one, BUYER BEWARE!!!! (There is no fine print .
Nice and sleek to have in the bathroom and it's not cold on your feet to step on.  So far it seems to be working perfectly.  Would recommend .
Love these bowls!! They're classic and there's a size for everything just wished I bought them sooner and I want a couple larger bowls too. Won't disappoint .
I loved my last pair of ASICS Gel but these ones seem a little less sturdy hence why I didn't give it 5 stars.  worth the $80 price though for a good squash court shoe .
Awesome jigger that doesn't spill. Easy to see measurements and looks great. Have the other oxo jigger with two different measurements on the top and bottom and end up spilling everywhere with that one. Get this one .
It was a great read. It was full of suspense. I wanted Melissa and Michael to fall in love, but since he was a vampire, their love could never truly be .
love the smell and not to oily but keeps hand moisture in place. I carry it around everywhere and it does not leak unlike other lotions it doesn't leak if properly sealed even in the summer heat .
Sturdy shoes require a little more and this falls apart after first use...you can put back together but not very user friendly .
Two thumbs up! Build is just like clash of clans with 3-d battles they are a older version but still nice. Kindle not in with clash so makes for great substitute .
worked great for a project i was doing that needed heavy duty scrubing. I was stripping cabinet doors with chemical stripper and had to scrub out the rest of the color with TSP. I couldn't find anything in the stores that was stiff enough so i went online and found these. Fantastic .
it doesn't work. never did.. not even with a new battery... it said it came with batteries.. nope .
The only thing I don't like about it is the drawer. It's a bit rough, and there have been a few splinters, but I can sand that down to be a bit smoother easily. The adjustment of how fine a grind you'll get, is really nice and simple. Can even do it while there are coffee beans in the grinder, which made me happy. Also, it goes fine enough for the stove top espresso maker I have to give me a lovely shot in the morning. Gives a good rough grind too for my french press. Turns easy, even when I pack it in to much .
i haven't used this machine yet messed with it in the shop seems ok but im not going to say anything else until im able to use it in difrent aplications some floor drains some sink drains then ill give my opinion .
It didn't work! Its too late too return it! So im stuck with a old and new battery that don't work .
Works perfect especially for those deep fryer pots.  It hinges on the side of the pot so you don't have worry about it falling in, would recommend this product .
A definite must for the holidays.  Save me tons of time and preping.  Can't wait to try on my pig roast for xmas .
why can't you make a fine tip stylus that will work with the kindle fire tablet--there are areas that you cannot effectively open with the fat stylus-I just dont understand .
terrible--doesn't work-why cant you make a fine point stylus-cant use on small areas-wasteof money-worst item you can buy-just awful-save your money .
you can accomplish a lot. An excellent and practical teaching tool. Some piano theory and playing practice would be a must .
Lots of great information. It is angled at the beginner but still loads of info for someone who can already make websites but hasn't thought of a profitable website idea yet. Lots of great ways to brainstorm for ideas for a websites, how to make them happen, and everything in between.It totally helped change the way I think about making money online.Well worth the money .
My friends and I like to make biological clock jokes, but we're only 20! This book taught useful lessons for the younger generation. You never want to lose yourself in a relationship, independence is important. The characters reminded me of my own friends. Light read. Highly recommended .
Great watch.difficultcolor to find.saved my aniversary :)don't miss to have one of these watches youll regret it .
Great book about a true story. I was a senior in high school when this occurred and I'll never forget the chills we had whenever I went out fearing we might run into these guys .
First time ordering a Bonsai tree so was a little hesitant.  I ordered this for a friend and it was exactly what he was looking for.  It arrived in reasonable time, in perfect condition and was everything he expected and more!!!  Can't say enough about the great product and the company I ordered from!!!  I will be doing business with them again for sure .
The case is pretty cool looking, has a nice feel. Not the protection I thought but it does the job. Wouldn't trust it from a fall of three feet though .
Tucker never gave up on her grandchildren, even though at times they didn't return the love.However at the end of the book they all realized that family meant everything .
Kept waiting for the kids to get out of the forest.  If you are going to tell me how many words I need to report on a book, then I won't be reporting any reviews .
Before I ordered the V2 Supported, I had a lot of pain simply walking around. I couldn't hardly do errands or get around at work because of SPD pain in my pregnancy.  I gave this product 5 stars because it has more than met my expectations. I was skeptical it could help.  Now I wear it everyday and it's very comfortable.  The velcro straps adjust to your support level as needed.  If it wasn't for the V2 Supporter, I would not be able to move about everyday. It's easy to care for, I wash it with my clothes and tumble dry.If you are suffering from SPD, vulvar varicosities or just need more support during your pregnancy, this is a wonderful product that I would highly recommend .
My family enjoys when we use the Taco Tray for taco night.  I enjoy it because it means everything can be loaded onto one tray and I don't have a million dishes to do!  It's attractive, fun and easy to wash / store .
We've had these cases on all of our phones. We started out with otterboxes and other "tough cases" but they scratched our phones and were hard to take apart.These come with a ONE YEAR warranty and are easy to take apart to clean. There are two layers. A soft silicone inner and a hard shell outer. These also come with screen protectors. Sometimes the inner silicone rips but we just send them back and they send us a new one. They never scratch out phones! They protect our phones every time we drop them. They fit snug and look pretty awesome. I only wish that they had more color options!I WILL NOT USE ANY OTHER CASE FOR MY iPHONE!!!!! These are the best .
AMAZING!!  This book can change your life for the better.  A must read!  I don't want to give it away, but it breaks down certain ways of negative thinking into possitive Christian  ways of thinking .
I am not running with it I bought it only for comfortable walks and it delivers it big time very good product .
diamonds fall off easily and  it doesn't  snap on as tight  as it should. I would not recommend it. actually  I m already ready  to change my cover .
I read the other reviews about the tighter fit of this Croc, but wanted the orthopedic footbed as I have fallen arches, and wanted a pair of slip ons that I could wear in light snow and rain.  At first I thought they were hitting my toes up front, but decided to wear them in the house for a day or two and see how it felt after that.  Then I switched off between my old ones - traditional model, and these, and realized that though they fit a little tighter, neither pair was without some little nit in terms of feel.  And after a day or so I realized they were fitting perfectly.  I recommend anyone who buys these and isn't immediately pleased - wear them inside for a few days and see if you don't change your mind .
I found the stretching - 3 different modes of essentially the same stretches, one without any props, one using a stretch band, and the other a ball, were very good.  I'm not sure though that it was worth the expense.  Most exercise videos are running $10-12 these days, and this one was around $27 .
I was wearing the NB804 tennis shoe but they are all leather and really hot, and as they aged, the leather loosened up and I couldn't tighten it up enough to keep my foot from slipping.  I wanted to move to the WC1005 but was concerned about the reviews noting the heel was wider/larger than in the previous model (1004) and although I have a wide foot, I have a narrow heel.  After trying them on in a store and having the heel slip initially, I re-tightened them and changed the lacing at the top, and they felt great. The white/blue version is running about $40 cheaper on-line than the all white so I bought it.  I've been wearing them for tennis several hours a day for the last two weeks.  I have a bunion on one foot and normally have to wear a D (wide) width, but in this shoe the regular B width has been perfect. They felt great from the first day and I'm very pleased .
The product was delivered on time and was exactly what I expected.  Price was great and I wouldn't hesitate to order another. So glad I picked this case for my phone .
This stuff works great and is not sticky like most other products. I love the pump for easy dispense. A little goes a long way. I recommend for both men and women .
I honestly never get the product got lost on the way and I can not give any opinion of it and never tried it .
The figures were really good.. Resembled the characters from the series.. But the material is really bad.. Now you do expect children to be a little rough when playing.. The necks of few of them came off.. My daughter is very gentle with her toys generally. This can become a chocking hazard.. I'll not recommend this product .
Does not stick well to the walls .. Since my daughter loves it I had to tape it. Products needs work to be done .
I can't find the spell shop to craft gemstone dragons, I've seen lvl 40s with it and I updated my game a day ago. Got new dragons, but no spell shop. Please help! Overall wonderful game indeed .
It's 2 Bad There's Only 5 Parts to This Series, In A Perfect World This Show Would Be On Everyday Like Your Moms General Hospital Ya Know. But Still The Walking Dead on AMC is Goin' Strong. There Needs To Be More Zombie Horror on TV and In The Movies 'Cause I Can't Get Enough .
It's slow with no current up date and powers off with out warning slow to make calls and open text messages .
Isn't it fortunate that Christie wrote so many Poirot stories, so that I can spend time with a more vibrant Hercule in the future and pretend I don't know how he ends his life .
I misplaced my CIF issued IFAK. This IFAK is the correct one to turn back in. . No more 29 Palms .
To be honest it wasn't worth the money. I read to my son he and I weren't pleased to think that this could be considered two books in one .
Delivery was excellent... product is not of you normal playing cards ...I got them for favors for a Vegas style Bridal shower... perfect and price was great .
This stuff is awesome, as a sceptic, wasn't sure it would work,  but looking for a easier solution then having my girlfriend wash her hands and rub clearasil on my back every day. I decided to try it.. its pretty expensive at 10$ a bottle but it DOES work. Wash your sheets and blankets every 2 weeks, clean towels, spray this stuff on.. it will work.. only gripe I have is that the bottle doesn't last very long..  will be a buy again .
The ball arrived deflated, naturally. And after several attempts to inflate it, the ball will not bounce properly. I will be sending this back .
Too heavy n bulky, there is not enough room for my credit cards n cash, for my taste. Its cute though .
Would be better if legs weren't be separated, scared to lose them. The rest is fine though the color of the body could be more realistic to my mind .
This is the best toy for my sons of those that I purchased along with it through Amazon. It's heavy but so cool that you never notice the weight .
Well, the title of my comment says it all, expected it to be bigger, the colors are not natural though why should they be natural if the creature is not natural itsself, right? LOL .
The set is huge, fits my 35-year-old sister, also the items have crooked seams, not sure what to do with it now, hoped for more, especially after many positive comments .
When I read comments about the smell of the mask, I ignored them but now I see why. It doesn't smell, it STINKS and it's impossible to even have it near, let alone wearing it or smelling it. The costume itsself is huge and of low quality, will think what to do about it as I can't send it back, ordered it with mail forwarder and not sure if I can change it but would do it if I could. My advice is to look for something else in Bane style but this smelly Chinese .... you know .
Wish it was bigger, not sure they wrote real size of the figure that I saw in description but the quality of the toy is fine, my little Joker will love it as one of his favourite toys once I present it to him .
My son will be 4 years old in 10 days, so this is the present for him, I love the toy though it's smaller than I expected, but I know my boy will love it as one of his favourite toys, he always plays Batman of lower quality and never complains .
As other similar items, these gloves' size is unpredictable. Bought it for my 10-year-old nephew, hope they'll fit as he's tall and his fingers are long (didn't try it on yet as it's a new year's eve's present .
Wow, they have a nice photographer, when I saw it I wanted to buy it immediately and did so. When I saw it &#34;live&#34; I was not as astonished but hey, will I play it? Nope, it's for my niece and she'll love it totally .
The set is interesting, stylish, but I rate only 4 stars for better and more interesting picture than what I see when I look at the set in real life. Probably would not buy it if I'd seen it in the shop before .
This hoody was purchased for my 5-year-old son and fits him well though the quality is not great. The print came off in some parts (of yellow color) and we haven't even washed it yet. The texture is fine, soft and worm, nice to wear when chilly. The hood is big though my son's head is not small as well. Expected more but will not return it, he likes it a lot .
My sons had a fight for the item (purchased together with Ironman hoody, but I'm not same happy with that one), lovely done, good quality, nice idea. I like everything about it, kids were going to sleep in the hoodies even, not to ever take them off .
I tried a cheaper silicone case that my boyfriend bought for the same phone and although I liked the feel it was too loose. This case is nice and hard but not too bulky and I love the color! I don't have any problems getting it on or off like another reviewer mentioned. If I have one complaint it's that the light color part is sort of a rough texture while the darker parts are smooth and I guess I wish the whole thing was smooth, but it's definitely not a deal breaker .
I needed a case for my new Kindle Fire HD but didn't want to spend an arm and a leg. This case was a good price and it got good reviews so I thought I'd give it a try and I'm glad I did! I get compliments on it all the time and the color was pretty true to the picture (I got the magenta one). I will say that it doesn't stand the best when in portrait mode, but is otherwise awesome. My favorite position is the one meant for typing- very cool. Would recommend .
G. E. Hamlin tells a captivating story about God's love for us and His intent for troubled marriages...actually, make that all marriages.The experiences that Darla, Randall, and Paul have are relatable for Christians and non-Christians alike. For example, what adult has never had a small child say something that changes one's perspective?While there is scripture quoted periodically throughout, the book is not (for lack of a better word) &#34;preachy&#34; like some other books I've read. I loved that I could relate to the story without feeling like I would be judged later for my own experiences.I received a complimentary copy of this book from the publisher in exchange for my honest review, but I can't wait until I can afford the small amount of money to buy my own copy .
Not really a toy, I bought this to go with my Captain America costume for Haloween. THis mask was exactly what I needed .
GOt these gloves and once I opened the package I immediately knew I had wasted my money. They were small, cheap quality and a complete waste of money. Do not buy these gloves .
Value for Money.  I am not a professional, but NiKon D7000 camera with the lens 18-200 made me as a professional .
If you love Fool's Gold you will love "Just One Kiss"!  If you have never read a Fool's Gold book before there is no time like the present!  With a lot of series you tend to get the same stories over and over with different names. Not so with this series.  I love the story lines and I love that you get to catch up with some previous characters! The town of fool's Gold is the all-American town we would all love to live in, with neighbors who care and who stick up for one another. I won't give a synopsis  of the book- you can read the back cover for yourself- but I'll just say that this is a great summer read .
This has been phenonmenal for me.  I don't know who many words are required, so I'll keep this short.  I highly recommend this book and this HEALTHY LIFESTYLE CHANGE.  I have lost about 12&#34; of my waist and now have my figure 8 back. I lost 6 lbs so far, probably could've been more, but I just started the MAG07 with the cleanse.  This literally changes your mind, your body and your life.  You don't desire the unhealthy foods anymore. You create an environment that is not only safe for you outwardly, but your body inwardly as well. Stop yo-yo dieting, and change how you eat. You will not regret it.MelissaWashington, DC .
Poor, poor quality.  I never used it.  I actually didn't even thing it was worth the trip to the post office to return it .
I didn't bounce that high it's loses its grip fast it became flat the second day I just hate it I wouldn't recommend it .
It doesn't work nearly as we'll as I hoped , some areas I don't even get service with it and rarely can get 4G .
If the rating has zero , probably i would give that to this productNot charging  and so not workingvery expensive and waste of  moneyI advice not to buy this product and waste your moneygo for a better one .
I love to watch Matlock.  I want to see more seasons.I never get tired of it. It is one of my favorite shows .
are very large gloves. I'm a size 10 and so the pedi and when I arrived I had plenty of space in the palm of your hand. They do not conform to the palm and when folded the latex is extended hand. It is best to buy two sizes for a better fit. than .
I have yet to use this on my newborn as she is not due till July. However, I have 3 other children and I will be the first to say that swaddling in the first days is the most important way to obtain sleep. I do think the fabric is soft and it seems sturdy for baby. So much better than trying to struggle with a generalized blanket .
I feel super pregnant at only 7 months and work in the medical field and have to wear scrubs! Scrubs are NOT pregnant friendly or stretchy at all! The belly band helps support my stomach and also hides any skin that would show between my top and my pants .
My female pittbull is a terror when it comes to dog toys, squeakers, and stuffed toys! However she has still yet managed to tear this into shreds! Al; her other toys including her kong won't even last a week tops and this has made it a month and still going. Granted the turtle head and limbs are now missing but the body hasnt even been penetrated .
Bought these for my husband and they look good and comfy! He hasn't complained about these shirts and usually he complains .
I received the ac adapter on time which was great. However it does not charge my laptop as described. I have a Dell latitude 620. If the charger worked i would have no problem giving 5 stars on this review .
I haven't ordered one of these in YEARS! This net is HUGE! It fit every single stuffed animal my 3 daughters had in one net. I did have to use a couple extra tacks to support the weight as the net would have stretched to the floor! But it does its job and that is to prevent the dog from eating all the stuffing .
I love this blanket. I have washed it several times already, bleached it, and tossed it right back on the bed! It doesn't bunch up and hasn't lost its comfort or fluff! I think its the best blanket thus far .
There is not much to say about these socks but they are super cute and adorable! They are thick and cozy for babies feet and as long as I don't lose any of them I am certain they will last a long long time .
Fit as expected for someone who is 7 months pregnant! Some of the maternity shirts are just not comfortable to sleep in and feel tight and this shirt is comfy but don't look manly on a woman .
When my newborn is due in July I plan to breastfeed her. Although I am a mother of 3 I have not yet ever breastfed and am excited to do so. I also am a working mother and know that maternity leave will end abruptly and will have to make a change to bottle/breast and I am looking forward to using these bottles. The bottle seem thick and sturdy and has just enough comfort for baby .
I have had a lot of comforter sets in the past and this by far beats any of them! I have already washed this several times and have not lost its fluff, comfort, or cozy texture. Does not come with a sheet set so you would have to purchase separately which I knew upon purchase. Best money I have spent for my bed thus far .
Very small miniature wagon. I was Very disappointed when it came in the mail. Not at all what I was expecting .
Definitely not what I thought it was!!It's half in Spanish. And no dancing like I thought it was supposed to be. Very disappointed .
I never buy cookbooks without seeing them first so I went to the store several times to check this one out....it was never in stock because it was selling out so quickly.  After a few weeks I gave in and bought it on-line site unseen.  Now I see why it was selling out!!  I love to cook and read cookbooks for fun, so it takes a lot to impress me...THIS DID!  It's huge, heavy, beautiful and mouth watering.The first thing I made was the General Tso's Chicken.  The chicken was perfect!  I've wanted to make a &#34;breading&#34; like that forever and never had a clue how to make it so fluffy...my kids were eating it faster than I could cook it!My only complaint so far is that I think the sauce recipe for General Tso's Chicken had a error in it. 1/2 cup of arrowroot powder made a very, very thick glob so I will use MUCH less next time, but the flavor was right on.  I am very excited to try more food from this cookbook .
Got it way before the date, but didn't get my remote. This is a good place to buy somthing from .
My 8 yr old sons cannot get enough of this book.  Everyday he is reading and writing in it.  The best gift he's received in a long time .
I loved it! I have bought live ladybugs from a gardening store before and they never woke up. But these lady Bugs woke up as soon as they felt the warmth of my home. Great product I recommend this seller .
I read Jerry Castaldo's book when he first published it.  I couldn't put it down and read it in less than a day.  The story is representative of the times when we were teenagers  and young adults and growing up in the mid 70's and early 80's in the Bensonhurst section of Brooklyn .
Love the quality of Fossil.  I was ordering this purse for my daughter.  She picked out this purse at Dillards and at the time I thought it would be less expensive online.  Ordered the purse thinking it would be smaller.  Was very disappointed when it came in 'huge'.  Wish there were dimensions on the website.  Returned the product due to not as pretty in the larger size .
Most brushes have two sets of bristles, one harder/one softer.  I see why after buying this one.  The metallic bristles are too hard for some golf course uses.  The little metal groove cleaner bit is good, but it is sharp and sticks out at a predatory angle no matter how you  clip it to your bag, so be forewarned, and go for it with your gloved hand.  Also, have seen this for 1/2 the price in retailers since then, so not the best deal here .
So I bought a bed online for short money, and when it was all put together, it sagged on the middle, even with just one average-size person.  The slat supports that came with it screwed on, and they were loose to begin with and eventually would not stay on.  Had to buy three of these adjustable legs, so the solution cost like 1/3 of the bed itself, but they did the trick.These install easily, just like the pictures, and work beautifully.  Perfect product if your bed sags in the middle.  Buy some if you need 'em .
I am definitely happy with the Peg Perego 12 volt battery charger my 3 yr old grandson loves driving his tractor all around the lawn & he wouldn't be doing it without this charger so Thank you Amazon .
even those you don't quit their job, you can learn a lot from this book and live a simpler, happpier life.  i did the same thing that kim and ed did in 1989 at the age of 45.  i never look back .
no comfort.  i can feel skecher'slevery pebble through the sole.  they are broken in no and i walked a 1/4 mile in them yesterday and i was limping when i got back .
it met all my expectation's.  it is perfect for my boat and patio. i don't know what to write to come up with the required # of word's .
i have another pair of skeecher's and they fit more snug than my new pair.  i haven't broke in the new pair yet .
I didn't work and wasn't what was described.  It said PX II on the case and failed to work on my system .
Cut really small, I only wear it around the house and to sleep in. I don't recommend this for people who dislike clingy clothes .
This product is a really good. You get the code in an email very quick. It saves you time from having to wait for it or go to a store and get one. It also saved you money because amazon has basically no tax and obviously there is no shipping. Over all I am very happy with my purchase .
First of all the battery life on the vita is just bad. If your on a trip you always have to turn the brightness down and wifi off to conserve battery life. This product is a life saver. I can play vita for double the time and not have to worry about battery life. Another plus to this product is that you can charge almost anything with a USB. I have charger my phone and iPod with no trouble at all. The only negative to this product is the price, it is sort of expensive. If you are frustrated with the vita battery life then I would recommend this product to you .
I must say this is a really good product. I don't have a case for my vita until this product came out. It hold everything nicely AND securely. I also would recommend getting yourself the ps vita portable charger because you can easily fit that and the USB into the pocket. Another plus is the fact that you can take out the section with the vita if you wanted, although I never do. If you want a case to hold some goodies for your vita then I would definitely recommend this product to you .
I never read the books but I have friends who have! It's a great show from the beginning and it just keeps getting better can't wait to find out who A really is .
I found this dvd in the $5 section at target and was happy but my sister kept arguing that it was hers so I looked on amazon and sure enough here it was for even less and brand new!  I cannot express how content I was it's definitely underpriced I've loved this movie since I first saw it.. definite should buy .
I was looking for a more subtle alternative to my lime crime styletto and figured I'd give this a try but it is very sheer  and not what I was looking for but it is a pretty color for those who like sheer lippies .
Forewarning for those of you who get irritated when the color does not arrive as it appeared , it is not baby pink like it states but more of a flamingo/barbie pink if you will it's a fun color and is fulfilling it's purpose to keep gunk out of my keyboard .
I looked everywhere for a pair of cat eye sunglasses and here  they were good quality and not pricey love em' .
I have not yet used this but I purchased it in case I was not allowed to have my labret in while working but it was packaged well and looks just as the picture shows ..I gave it four stars becuase I haven't yet attempted to put it on and I'm not sure if it is difficult, hope this helps someone :P .
It's just as cute as it looks and hasn't broken and I don't think it will ..I thought it also had a front part of the case but it does not just an fyi which I don't mind but the white version I had did but it's cute and I like it .
it's cute but it was hard to remove and I broke the thin side :( I was very disappointed but only wish it hadn't broke I'm not sure if I wasn't careful enough or if it was the case itself but it's cute and I do recommend it .
I love the look of this incense burner.It doesn't work with stick incense. I am putting it in his mouth. Going to try cones. I's like to see it have smoke come out of his mouth. I hope the cones are a solution to the problem. I do like the stick incense better. Enjoy .
the Fringe series is a cross between X-Files and the Time Machine. I was hooked from the start. The acting is brilliant. The writing is inspired. I do love J.J. Abrahams work. Try watching it. You must watch and not be distracted. Keep an open mind when you watch this program. It's a wild ride from start to finish. If you like a good mystery, a science Fiction and adventure film all in one .
Ghosts of girlfriends past is not suppose to be anything but fun. Everyone quit being so afraid to be yourselves. It doesn't matter what anyone says. If you like something have fun! Does anyone remember FUN. Enjoy every min you can. This film is a great background movie. But then I liked Sahara. It also was just fun. Lighten up hug each other, your children. anyone who needs support. Ask for a hug if you need one. It is not weak to feel the most powerful thing on Earth, Love. Peace to all of us .
I really like the resident evil series of movies. I was disappointed. There was nothing that drove the story of these series of films. All the other films left a to be continued feeling. This film did not .
My husband and i purchased this for our oldest son. Well the box did not indicate if we needed film or not. And the springs inside the bulb of the flashlight always pop out and you have to pop them back in. So this toy is alright but not worth the money .
I thought this toy would have done more. It lights up and counts and says blast off.WASTE OF MONEY.MY SON WILL NOT PLAY WITH IT IT IS A NO FUN TOY.NOT WORTH IT .
I bought this to prevent germs. It has worked so far. I do not care for the drink holder. But other then that it is perfect exactly what i was looking for .
Bought this for our oldest son. Sadly the ladder breaks off untill finally you can not pop the ladder back on. It is an alright toy but not worth the money .
Effective Product,  My podiatrist recommended it.  It is very difficult to find in retail drugstores.  The price seems reasonable. The delivery was punctual, however, I don't understand why I had to pay shipping and handling charges for this one jar but not for the 2 jars above that I ordered at the same time.  The total charge for all 3 jars was above $35 .
The symptoms of my Neuropathy have diminished.  I assume that it's related to the taking of B-Right.  It may not be but that's my assumption .
I have lost 20 pounds recently, but I lost my rear.  I need room in the front and not the back.  I have been wearing size 6, do i need to go to size 5 .
I replaced an old drum--one that had been in use for a very long time--with this "new" one, which I believe was refurbished or repackaged. The "drum life end" error message started up almost immediately after installing this drum, and print quality went downhill fast. Now I'm already getting "clean corona wire" messages, which don't clear after I do clean the corona.I believe this was a recycled, not-well-refurbished unit, and that's why the price was low. I'd say "you get what you pay for," but even that would be overly optimistic, in this case. I recommend paying full price and getting full quality .
I was given a free copy of this book for review.When I first agreed to read this book I expected that it was about time travel. To an extent it is, but it is mostly actually about a few characters who while well fleshed out, are more than a little implausible in their own ways. For example, Judith, who was a dancer who broke her ankle (but can still dance better than anyone they've ever seen) is as beautiful as a model, doesn't wear a bra in the car (with two guys while on a road trip) and also happens to be a trained racecar driver. P.S. she also loves sports and can win 70k playing Blackjack for four hours.Despite it's implausibilities, the novel strikes me as the early work of an author who will one day be brilliant. The story is great, and the further you read into the book, the better it gets. I guarantee that the first few chapters are the worst. The plot also gets significantly better, and while much of what happens is purely by chance or coincidence, it's well worth the read.The story is quirky and fun, and full of Star Trek references, and the clear statement that Bob Seger is still one of the greats, even in the not-so-distant future where Master's degree students can save up $10,000. It's also filled with action, bacon and eggs, and more Star Trek references.While not perfect, this book comes off as something designed not to be a book, but rather a movie. I would love to see the screenplay.Luckily, I have been told that there is a second book coming out shortly to remedy the books cliffhanger ending .
I purchased this book and read it in about 6 hours but I am a fast reader . Overall it's very well written and I enjoyed it  I will be looking forward to the sequel. I do think it could have used a tiny edit for a couple of wee errors but these do not affect the story. Characters are very nice for the most part .Very well written and excellent creativity on the part of the author .
I considered purchasing the paid version of this app but decided to try the free version first,I honestly have had no problems with the adds and really think it's just as good as the paid version .
I purchased this game because I love Diablo and I noticed that it was on sale. for just $5 I made the purchase (there was tax applied)One thing I noticed immediately is that except for the graphics being different and the story being of lesser quality this is Diablo II in a different format. I love Diablo so no problem there, and I will play this game all the way through. One thing I will note about the game is that you should never play it in Easy, it's just too easy. Enemies stand back and wait for you to kill them, wander around in other rooms, etc. Usually I try a game out on the lowest level first to see how it goes and then proceed up for a different experience each time but this time I think Im starting on the second to highest level. Excellent purchase .
this is my favorite of the six stella hayne novelletes i have read. It is also the longest and almost on par with a short harlequin  the character is convincingly written as a strong willed young feminist of the regency era who shows an array of.emotions not usually present in short erotica  I have to say, masterfully written and in the words of Oliver Twist ' Please ma'am can i have some more'  would love to see the tables turned and Lucas in love with Viola .
I like the app and it usually works how it should but I have noticed two very distinct problems1. I frequently get 'Facebook has Stopped' and the app restarts2. It sometimes does not connect to the internet despite my email and web browser working fine.I think this is a great app that could use  a bit more work to get rid of the glitches and then it's really just Facebook for your Kindle .
Songpop is addicting and fun and it works really well on Kindle. While it's a little faster via a web browser, the app is everything that a game app should be, you just might want to bring along your headphones if you don't want to annoy everyone else in the room .
If you have never worked online before then this is a great mini guild  But you won't get anything out of it that you couldn't get for free online. I read this in less than 15 minutes and it has no real info other than friendly advice which is mostly very well written .
I bought this book after Pope Benedict XVI resigned  And I have to say it is a great source of information on the prophecy of the popes otherwise known as the prophecy of saint Malachy. The other prophecies do not go into to as much detail but I bought it to read about saint Malachy so I really am happy with the in depth explanation. I've actually never even heard of many of them so  I'm guessing there might not even be a lot of real information available on them. Nice to read a fact based look at the old prophecies. Thanks .
very nice jeans but I have doubts even if they are original to one hundred percent since the back in the pocket where levis label work only has red and the symbol of R but not the name brings levis and not very comfortable as they are not Americans but made &#8203;&#8203;in mexico but just thank you very much I trust you are original levis greetings from Venezuela .
Im sure glad I wasn't depending on the charger...it wasn't even for the Note 3.  But it was basically the only reason I got this case .
Excellent Battery, Perfect fit and it works amazing  with my laptop. I don't have any complains about this battery. Thanks .
I wanted this type of toaster because I often buy &#34;Wide Pan&#34; bread.  It works very well and has nice features.  My only slight concern is that the slots are a bit shallow and the top of the slice doesn't toast at the same darkness as the bottom of the slice.  Overall, I'm glad I bought it.  Price was fine .
Everything you ever thought as a parent but wouldn't say aloud, and then some. Literally laughed through the whole book. Can't wait to read again .
I thought it was an interesting book. This was the first comic I've read since I was 6-8. I'm not the conventional comic fan but I bought this book to help with an advertising assignment for my college. They asked me how I'd make a Justice League film and how I would market it. It provided me with insight on how the justice league was formed and gave me several good ideas .
I ordered 4 different colors because these are my favorite kind of hats. The Black was a little  tight and gets extremely hot. But that's good. The Gray was my favorite perfect fit & keeps my head warm.  The White is kind of loose. The Light Blue came in on it's own and whoever "took care" of the package pretty much destroyed it. But the company was awesome with customer service and gave me a refund, they didn't even ask for it back .
It looks nothing like the picture. Horrible. I opened the box & it's packaging right before I put it on I noticed a rip in it. My hair shines right through it also .
Mine doesn't glow well but It does stick out. my last phone got stolen at the club, so this one isn't going anywhere thanks to the semi glowing case. The black does rub off really easily but in all it does it's main job protecting my phone .
I love this Movie. It's more like a chick flick version of Spiderman but it's still good. Marc Webb tried to change key moments in his history but we all know you can never reword "With great power comes great responsibility." All this aside.... Tobey Maguire > Andrew Garfield .
Love it! I bought a new iPod not knowing there was a new "lightning" chord and my old dock wouldn't fit. I love this speaker it's easy to set up and my technologically-impaired mother even knows how to use it. Simple set up and good sound. The only critique I have is that it sounds muffled but with that said it still doesn't sound bad at all .
For some reason I thought this was a soft shell and ordered it. It's not bad but it causes my mac book to overheat really fast. My macbook is only a year old. It honestly just sits in a junk drawer at my house now. However, the gel keyboard mesh does give it a cool look so it's not a complete fail .
It's the Dark Knight rises trilogy.... It doesn't matter what I say, you're still going to buy it no matter what .
At a pricing point of 8 USD, I figured this would be a basic, functional controller. Regrettably, I opened the box and found out immediately that that was simply not the case. This controller is genuinely awful and the prior reviews show it.For my specific device, the Right Trigger was jammed right out of the box. I had to remove one of the four screws holding the controller together just for the trigger to budge at all. Barring that, the D-Pad and large A/B/C face buttons are passable but the triggers and especially the smaller X/Y/Z buttons are completely unreliable. You can't lightly press these buttons and expect them to work; you have to push and hold them all the way down just for your input to register.If you are looking for something that will get the job done, find another ten to twenty dollars and look elsewhere. Should you order this, you are more likely to find a fixer-upper project here than a working device that's fun to use .
My Hori FC3 Pro wore out a week before an upcoming tournament, so I chose this pad as an emergency replacement. I don't regret my purchase, but I don't think this is a long-term controller for competitive players either.The pad does what it says on the tin. It is much smaller and lighter than I expected it to be, which may be a problem for gamers with large hands. The face buttons and triggers have a snappy, responsive tactile feel, and Start/Select were sized and placed intelligently (very small and out of the way, so you'll never press it in a tournament).Regrettably, the directional pad is floaty and not suited for precise movements. It is most similar to an over-sized 360 D-Pad with a wider range of motion and somewhat better accuracy. Grapplers may feel at home churning butter, but the pad will likely slow you down during commands that require more finesse than a shoryuken (e.g. pretzels or pentagrams). Due to its design, it is very likely that the D-Pad will snap off entirely after about a year of intensive use -- or after a handful of bad matches if you tend to abuse your controllers. Handle with care.Compared to my old FC3 Pro, the triggers are considerably better but the D-Pad is surprisingly mediocre. Nevertheless, this pad is one of the better choices in the sub-$30 price range and should be more than enough for entry-level fighting game players .
I tried 2 bulbs .one of them doesn't work.I don't know if the rest two work either.Hope them are good .
The product description clearly states that 24 charms should be in the set, but I only received 22 charms. Plus, none of the metal rings are actually attached to the charms. Luckily, I have jewelry tweezers and can attach them myself. Not recommended if you don't have tools to attach the rings.  As I can see from the reviews, I'm not the first person to receive a package with missing charms .
I like this case not only for the kick stand so i can watch my movies but it's very durable. I drooped my phone a few times and it never broke or cracked my screen .
I got this case for my boyfriend and we both loved it!!!!!! :) only bad thing is... I didn't get the free bonus stuff? But it's awesome! Thanks .
Don't let the plastic look fool you, it not cheap at all and actually gives off a great force of water and refreshes the tired body. Give it a try, at this great price and quality, it's well worth it. Ps: Your guest will love it .
These are beautiful.......only thing is they are not as picture depicts. I've taken the liberty of uploading some actual images of them in chocolate, hope they help in your ordering process. Shipped for free being it over $25 and arrived properly and on time .
I didn't know if they'd actually be as they appear online, but to my surprise they were just AWESOME! They are of quality fabric and nice coloring. Very "Happy" with my purchase and would definately recommend it to others. Oh Ps; they block out light really well also, what a bonus! Just had 1st time guest with them, and they raved about not having light piercing in until they wanted it. Great curtains .
Outdated info and it does not give enough tips I prefer buying it if u want little tips or I know most of it .
Works well, but the tiny screws on the side didn't screw in to my vga cable. So it unplugs on its own every once and a while, and then it messed with the screen resolution on my mac. But i just changed it via the recomended resolution. So again minor problems, but overall no lag and clarity is sharp. So decent product .
good story line with a great deal of twists and turns to keep you interested.not quite the ending you expect .
This app is great and so easy to maneuver for our 5 year old homeschooler!  She loves playing and doesn't even realize it's work! Perfect addition to our school day .
Ok... So i've been playing with Halo 4 since release date and all I can say is wow! This game is so awesome! I seriously have to juggle work, sleep, and playing! I have read a lot of the reviews and some of the customers getting messed up consoles, sorry about that fellas. As for mine, working like a charm. This is my 1st xbox console, but believe me, I have been searching for the perfect xbox for years. I almost bought the Gears of War 3 limited edition bundle, then decided i'll just get the MW3 limited edition console... Thankfully I waited for this one! :) They are basically the same (the 3 editions mentioned) and only differ with the design. As for the specs, well you should know this by now because if you are reading this review then you must have already thought about buying this beauty.SPECS:- 320 gb hard drive- 2 limited edition Halo 4 transparent controllers with blue lights (and yes, this is different from the "limited edition" controller that they are selling outside of this bundleXbox 360 Halo 4 Limited Edition Wireless Controller)- A custom Halo 4 design of the console with transparent casing, also with blue lights, and custom sounds when you power on/off the system and when you open the CD tray- Copy of the standard Halo 4 game- Add-ons found in the box and also if you were able to pre-order this from amazon then they will email you a code for additional armor skinsI WISH IT HAD:- HDMI cable... Although all the other bundles don't come with one either... It would be nice if they include one in addition to the composite cable... Just saying :)- Limited edition Halo 4 game instead of the standard game that's included in the bundle... That way it would be "limited edition" in every aspect. I ended up purchasing the map pack from live.Sad thing is it's currently unavailable in amazon right now. If you think you really want this product, then you may have to resort to buying it from your local store or from ebay which we all know would be at least $50 more than the retail price because of the high demand for this bundle. As for the transparent casing, it's not everyone's cup of tea but I like it! So it's really up to you guys if you are willing to shell out extra $$ just to be able to get your hands on this, but if you do, then you won't regret it! :)*** Update ***Looks like it's back in stock! Awesome .
I'd give the movie triangle 3 out of 5 stars but it had the potential to be a 4 star film only if the lead actress mellissa George had solved the problem on the ship and realtered the events which happened. sadly the director did not go that route in the film. therefore it was an ok film. Triangle only if I were your director then people would have loved you .
Before I watched altitude I seen the reviews on the film were not up to par. None the less it was a very well directed and acted film. I catch my self wanting more. Now I only wish there were more movies like it .
If you love suspense then you will love the killing. What I do not understand is why no one is talking about this show. The two lead actors in this show are what makes it so special. They work so well with each other. Can't wait till next season .
Going into bates motel I expected what every other American expected. Freak, lost soul, and a man who seemed abandoned from the real world.  Norman was the total opposite. This show caught me by surprise. It actually grabbed me and I was caught staying up till 8 in the mourning finishing all 9 shows when bed time is normally midnight. Bates motel turns into mystery with a little twins peak. Which is what the director ment all along. You find yourself wanting to see more of the towns people than you do actual the bates hotel. This show is amazing and can't wait till season 2 .
This is my second time reading the trilogy. That's how much I've enjoy. It's an easy read. Once you start reading. You can't wait to see what is going to happen next. I'm looking forward to the next book .
Perfect transaction. My case arrived on time and well packaged. This zerolemon product has more than lived up to the hype. The case fits very snug and is extremely well built. There are no issues with it blocking any of the ports incorrectly. The case does not block the camera at all. The case has its own protective screen which you can pop out if you want but I left mine in and also have one on the phone itself and am having no problems. Its grippy which is good. The battery adds a good bit of weight to an already big phone, but chances are if you already have a note 3, you probably are in it for the performance and not the &#34;cuteness&#34;. Speaking of performance, I am constantly using my phone for videos, games, social media, shopping and sometimes I even use it as a phone! On average I am getting 2-3 days easily out of the phone and with minimal phone use, you could squeek 5-7 days out of it no problem. But, if you are a power user, 2-3 days is what you can expect. Battery charges up from nothing to full in about 4-5 hours. If you want the promise of incredible battery life and don't mind a big phone, then look no further. Cheaper than an Otterbox and triples your battery life .
Since I can't find this in stores anymore, I had to order here. But this will absolutely be my favorite all time fragrance. I also have several high end fragrances such as Versace, D&G.. But Curious from Britney Spears is my favorite lol .
Nice for the money, built a little cheap. Such as the wheels are not rubber; they're plastic. Bought it for my bunnies to transport in car and to vet .
I have a long torso and this doesn't give a lot of room for that without pulling the top wayyyy down. So I have to wear a black cami with this and pull it down for it to fit. Also, I ordered a large and it fit, I think a small would've been too small. I am 5'8&#34; but I am a size 4/6 in jeans and S/M in tops. Quality was ok, nothing special .
I bought this for my free range (indoor) house bunnies. I put nest boxes with straw inside, and they love it. They go in there to hide away. But I'd never lock them in it. It's nice quality too .
The quality is nice, but it's MUCH smaller than it appears and smaller than measurements are saying. I'm keeping it only because I don't want to go through the hassle of sending it back. But I'll have to buy another bigger one now .
I'm so happy to say that I was able to fix my own cracked phone screen! I have no technical experience, at all, but I just followed the directions carefully and successfully fixed it! It took patience and I did have moments when my phone was sitting there apart thinking WTF did I do?! Lol but in the end I figured it out and results were great .
The shock looks like a good quality shock, but when ordering, order 2. This item is for one shock and not a pair .
The pen itself is good.  During the shipping it did get a crack though..  I also didn't realize that you only get one pen, which was a little dissapointing .
Liked it, not as interesting as I thought it would be but still a good read. Predictable ending, needed a good twist .
The author constantly advises to seek medical training which is good because you are not going to get it from this book. The book has no pictures or drawings on the use of IFAK components, only brief descriptons. There is a lot of unexplained medical terminology used in the book. The book is very short at 45 pages not counting the exercises. It has a lot of white spaces in those 45 pages. It is unclear as to what qualifies Gunner Morgan to write a book on this subject, most books have a section about the author but not this one. I believe that if you are going to write a book called Trauma Care for the Worst Case Scenario then you should include far more information than is being given .
I bought this for a gift.  The recipient loved it.  It was utilitarian.  No problems noted.They really, really enjoy using it .
This was a replacement.  I bought an extra one for a friend.  It is so convenient.  It flips down only when needed.  No bother when other driver use the car .
My hair is stronger and getting fuller. I can see results since starting to use it. Nothing else to say .
It is so convenient to carry only one and not both wallet and phone case.  I got  so many compliments and comments on my first one, I bought about ten for gifts.  I only wish it would hold a larger phone.  I cannot use my protective case .
Having this applied to my IPad mini was a good move. No more fingerprints. Someone else applied the apparatus but said it was easy .
This is the third pair of shoes I ordered from Amazon in less than a month.  This pair is about a half size too big.  There is a gap of about a half inch at the back of the shoe.  I gave the shoes away as I hate making returns.  My friend who wears a size seven loves getting name brand shoes.  I will never order shoes on line again .
Hope  to never use it.  Always better to have the extra protection than not.  When I called to register the warrantee, the agent was exceptionally friendly and helpful .
Wow, I love my Garcinia Cambogia Extract Pure!  It has been many years since I tried a weight loss supplement.  This one caught my eye and I did my research.  I am a pretty healthy eater, just can't seem to keep my portions down.  This product is really helping me do that.  I am getting fuller faster and no more late night hunger attacks!  I'm averaging a 1-3 pound weight loss a week, which is perfect and I am not experiencing any side effects! Simply fantastic and I have recommended this to all my weight challenged friends.  WoooHooo .
I know that OuterBox may be pricey, but we'll work the money. It is guaranteed through all the specs I read about it. I wouldn't have any other case for my phone. PROTECTION GUARANTEED! Thanks .
We swiched to Newman's organics after our 4 cats became obeseand dehadrated.it is ahealthier choice for them and they like the food.unfortunately it arrives squashed and some can get punctured and rotten.4cases were in the biggger carton together .  Big carton was not damaged.it appered some of the  previously squashed case is put among thenot damagedcase. degree of the damage is inconsistant.each can has to have the label peeled off to examine the puncture mark before feeding .
I couldn't remember how this story ends so I started reading and got really interested. I have grown up watching movies and tv ,the twilight zone was a favorite and this was one I watched. Much better reading than watching .
I thought this would be a novel not a short story. I was just getting  into it and it was over .
This one did'nt let me play;just wanted me to update and spend money;I will not pay to play something advertised to be free .
very fast read,I really enjoyed how the characters interacted within the story. It had a twist I didn't expect. I wanted more to happen but that is why it was called a short story .
I am planting a garden where the pups play and I want to be careful not to buy toxic ones .I hope it is thorough .
We should all be cooking this way! American dietary habits are not the best.I picked up aot in here to make a few meals and they were good .
I can really say this book has some different recipes to make my potatoes go farther and not just throw them away. Thanks .
There truely were not enough new reciepes in this book.I would have liked more slow cooker  ones.Glad I did not buy it .
Funny how Amazon thinks it can compete in the online-streaming business, when it can't even upload their own original series correctly .
This is the best running shoe I've ever had!  Really wish Nike would keep making this exact shoe.  No problems and my feet feel great in these .
This book has really been an eye-opener! I have heard and read a lot of this information before but just never really connected the dots and truly believed that I could commit to a certain way of eating. It is more than just a 'diet' it is a way of life. Alicia has included some fantastic recipes that I can't wait to try. I am so thankful I stumbled across this as I know my life and the choices I make from now on will be kinder to my loved ones and this world .
I hate this pepole you guys didn't send me my stuff that i order i do NOT recamend this pepeol .
This is a poorly built Pump. I bought my first one about 2 months ago placed in my 3000 gallon pond and it worked for 3 days. Shipped back to Amazon for replacement and they shipped another one out in 3 days. Went through the process of replacing the pump again, Turned on Sunday afternoon with great water flow but then on Thursday when i came home from work zero water flow again. Pulled pump back out and guess what ..............................BROKE AGAIN..............................................I would NOT recommend this product to any one. This is nothing but a poorly made piece of junk that does not belong on any site for purchase or in any store because it is not work the money or the time to place in the water .
Robin Kaye's book cover had me at first glance! Her new Bad Boys Of Red Hook series will not disappoint.  The characters are wonderfully written, funny and beautifully described.I  enjoyed this book so much, I wanted to make plans to take the next flight out to Red Hook and meet them. The romance between the main characters is so good, I'm secretly hoping she'll write a romance with gay men!  Fingers crossed. X .
Read my first Robin Kaye book last year. And what a book it is! The comedy between the characters are gut-bustingly funny! And the romance between the main characters is so intense, I felt like I needed a cigarette afterwards!Hot! Hot! Hot! Had me wishing I was The female character. It had me saying, "Romeo, Romeo, where is my Romeo?" Lol. Shakespeare Himself never knew Romeo's potential. Read Robin Kaye. She'll have you wanting more & more & more .
This book is simply amazing, it definitely made me cry! Not the average love story at all. You won't regret it .
Sin lugar a dudas The Dark Side Of The Moon es uno de los mejores discos de Pink Floyd y de la historia de la m&uacute;sica, y lograr tenerlo en esta edici&oacute;n remasterizado es imperdible para los fanaticos de Pink Floyd. El documental que trae con entrevistas a los m&uacute;sicos de como se hizo el album es excelente, este documental trae subtitulos en Ingles, Frances, Espa&ntilde;ol, Italiano, Aleman, Portugues, Japones y Cantones. Este producto es 100% recomendable .
Purchased this unit in 2006. Perhaps my expectations were too high but noted right off that its was not very powerful. The quality of the mowing is not very good either. Blade does not hold an edge - I have gotten into the habit of sharpening every 3rd or 4th mow, which to me is ridiculous.Battery is very heavy and does not hold a charge anywhere near what is advertised.Battery began to become worse after second season, and had to be replaced prior to 4th season. I then learned the current batterys do not fit in this unit (it seems to be a touch wider) and the old charger would not work - had to order a new one from Neuton so total for battery replacement was about $140.00.Also not happy that even though mower is stored inside, it has become very faded - no idea why this is when its exposed to the sun for only about an hour a week.I thought about upgrading to the 6.2 model but Neuton really didn't seem very interested in my business. I even wrote to the president (the goof on the commercials) - no response at all.I am looking for a larger / more powerful more (prob 36 or 48v) but it will not be a Neuton .
Did not fit my vehicle (2013 Prius C). They constantly slide off and do not have holes for the seatbelt. However, they do the job .
This package waa not at all what i expected i was ao exocyed getting home to open my package and it was completely different the did not have the padding in the back you also attach the straps myself the bag was not all leather and was very small .
Just for this dress for a wedding in Sept. I'm 19 weeks 5'2" and 124lbs (already a a good size bump). It is a maternity dress and looks good. Ordered a small and added a belt above my bump... Looks great and glad I purchased. Can't beat the price either .
Very disappointed! The doll I received is wearing a different and very plain dress compared to the one in the picture. I tried to exchange it for the right one, and wasn't allowed. This was for Christmas, and to order a new one, is $14 more .
Not to sure about it yet ?? Ive only had a cup n nothing happen it has a nasty taste didn't go down good .
Got mines fast ship!Starting today hopefully i have some results in a month ill post another update on my review soonBut you'll never no int'l u try emPrice was cheap nothing to lose .
There ok. Front shaped a little funny to me.Made my feet hurt real fast even gotta side cut w socksOn. I wouldn't buy again became they looked cheapAnd easily gets dirty stuff sticks on them easily.: / wish i don't buy but oh well i know now .
Its ok ..  Cute but kinda cheap !  Wouldn't buy again .. They have actually nice iPhone cases at 99 cent only .
I like them but they don't look real like other say.I would buy again only because it cheap and simple .
I wouldn't buy the brush set againThe price was good but it just looks very cheap I would not buy .
it feels kinda of cheap didn't notices a difference in my face. my face is like round circlewouldnt buy .
Just a cheap charger doesn't last long but ok for a month i guess.. To short too which sucks .
It was actually cute and keeps my phone covered up good i would buy again!  No bad for the price .
I don't think it has been long enough to say if it is going to make my eyelashes grow to the point were it is really noticable.I must say that it makes my lashes silkier looking .
This hair dryer is heavy, and doesn't get as hot as I would like, I have medium length hair, so it takes awhile to dry, and is hard on the arms and hands .
Apparently my car vents are small, so the holder doesn't fit! It is made nicely, but unless you have an older car with big vents, this holder isn't useful .
This is a very nice collar!  Easy to put on and the dog doesn't pull anymore! I like the thickness .
This candle is not only beautiful, but the clean smell of sage fills the room and lasts for days!  I especially love it when I cook .
I liked this item for my larger cat, but he doesn't fit, I do like it for his sister who is smaller, she can see out and it calms her on her visits to the groomer and Vet .
The study guide for "Who do you think you are" is a great resource to explore in depth your identity by asking questions that correspond to the chapters as well as the sermons. I have never seen such an extensive study guide before with a series for all types of groups including women, youth, small group and individual daily devotions. I highly recommend getting the study guide if you are feeling challenged, convicted or curious about the series/book "who do you think you are". They clearly spent a lot of time to compile this study guide and it shows in the depth that this book wants to take you .
Hutchins nails `island living challenges', colloquialisms and weaves her unique, biting perspective in this first tongue and cheek novel, Saving Grace, through likeable characters embracing each other in spite of coming from very different cultures.This new author writes MODERN FUNNY and took me on a compelling adventure where the fine line between comedy and tragedy gets fuzzy.This book will be enjoyed by anyone who has ever lived (or survived living) on the edge of functioning first world society in the Caribbean.Pamela's enjoyable book Saving Grace harkens me back to the late great Herman Wouk's novel, Don't Stop the Carnival.I look forward to reading and watching as Pamela Fagan Hutchins grows in her gift for storytelling .
Looks healthy, excellent shipping, love it ,, i can't wait to eat the fruit, , last time was 20 years ago, from my backyard acerola tree in puerto rico,,,,, and acerola juice,,,, mmmmm .
I ordered this for my mother and it wasn't quite what she expected. I think she thought it would be just them singing, but some of the songs featured other singers .
I have the first two books of the series. I thought this was the last of the series, but I believe there are two more. Would love to have them also to complete the story. I don't want to be left hanging .
I like the turquoise stone and the antique looking design. I didn't realized the stone would be as small, but I like it .
I ordered the blue birthstone color, but I received the clear. I didn't want to bother about sending it back .
Had to buy it for school. The book brings up some interesting points but overall quite uninteresting and repetitive. The seller was able to get it to me fast and with no hassle .
I am very happy when these slides came. My husband installed it and he had no problem. The slides are solid and it glides very smoothly. I was just a little surprised it did not come with screws, so I had to go to Home Depot to get me some. No big deals though. It saved me so much money over the other slides. By the way these slides are made by Knape & Vogt .
The counting part didn't work on either bank .first it was a little off then quit moving at all with more quarters added .
It protects my phone from scratches. And it sticks on the phone with no problems. Would recommend it for everyone with an I phone .
It is what I wanted . Haven't used it yet.Received it on time. My husband loved it bought it as a gift for him .
Way too small thought it was bigger than picture.If bigger would look great in window at Christmas time don't like .
HiI'm really sadSetting the clock on my watch winder does not fit the timeMy watch is a Hamilton JazzmasterThe movement is caliber H-21Watch winder what mode is it?Take care of quick answers .
I should have read the book many years ago, but like other things, I just didn't get around to reading it.  I can now understand the kind of issues the story caused when it was written .
Steve Berry is a good writer, but this book didn't hold my attention like the Dan Brown books.  It is, however, the first Berry book I have read .
There is nothing better than reading a book written by someone with direct knownledge of what took place.  Documentation was very thorough.  I am so pleased that so many people give so freely of their God given skills and talents to this great country .
It was a good book and I enjoyed reading it, but I don't think it was the quality of Killing Kennedy.  High school students should be encouraged to read it .
The book was well researched.  O'Reilly permitted the events throughout the book to unfold in a very natural and timely manner.  It opens one's eyes regarding many of the issues of the times and that of the presidency.  I can't wait to read Killing Lincoln .
Although I didn't think the book was overly well written, the contents it contains addresses and helps explain many of the issues we continue to face in the nation today.  Ignorance has to be a central theme of the story.  It wasn't because the characters had to be uninformed regarding life, but because they selected to maintain that way of life.  The only successes in the family were the children that saw a better way of living and acted upon what they saw.  When thought is given to the storyline it highlights many of the same problems many families are facing in today's world.  Immediate gratification seems to be what is most important and the central theme of the story.  It is easy to understand why people saw the book as pornographic when the book was written.  It provided me with a better understanding of poverty and how it was actually created .
The product is exactly what it is advertised to be, a screen protector.  It doesn't do much for reducing glare .
Best fighting gane ever my favorite game in ps3 I never get bored of it since I bought it I play it every weekend and more .
I like it so much its makes me looks so fit and its commfi color is very good I can't say but good .
The slip pouch case is suppose to be for the I-Phone 4 but somehow it fits a little too tight. It"s hard getting the phone out of the case , &  it" pebble- grain design which I don"t care for. Which I was kinda disappointed withIt.  & a another thing  but this has nothing to do with the phone case. AmazonSpelledMy last name wrong, My last name is spelled  Galatro.  Not Galatea that"s wrong.  Thank you.  Maria. Galatro .
Pros:The Comfort Research XXL in Comfort Suede (Espresso) is a decent bag, and it is certainly XXL.After propping it between a bay window and a coffee table, I was able to get it into a comfortable shape that didn't spread out into a wide, flat, shit-pancake of cheap foam.Not as expensive as a Love Sack.Cons:However, it really is NOT suede. The material is a combination of felt and vinyl, feels soft but pretty artificial and cheeeeeap.Why is it called espresso? It's dark brown (po-tay-to, po-tah-to I guess)When it arrived the zipper that grants you access to the innards of the bag was broken, so it is permanently closed off.This is a problem because after waiting a few days expecting it to fill up to a more full size and shape, the bag remained pretty flaccid.Bottom line, it needs more filling. Filling also feels pretty cheap.Picture of the bag with the girl laying in it is pretty misleading. The bag when unsupported on the sides lays flat in all directions, and rests at about 1-2 feet off the ground. The picture makes it looks like it has a spherical shape. It does NOT!You get what you pay for .
Thick, silky-smoothe, luxurious, and warm(but breathe-able) are just some of the words I'd use to describe this sheet set. Coming complete with a nice, subtle, ruffled detail, the ends of the pillow cases and top sheet really drive home the fact that these are not some s***ty 600 thread count, cotton-pilled, overpriced, designer nonsense you are forced to get in a department store.1500 threads baby. Its simple math, over twice the material and you notice it right quick.This sales lady at Macy's tried to convince me that 1500 compared to 800 thread count(highest they had) doesn't make a difference but she obviously was just trying to get the sale. She failed and I blindly got this instead (glad I did).Taupe - great color and looks exactly as advertised in the picture. Looks a lot like a brown/beige/grey that has a glossy sheen to it, so you could almost say its a chocolate color. Goes really well with my beige bedding and carpet.BUY THE SET .
At the beginning of the book I almost stopped reading but decided to give it a few more pages. I'm certainly glad I did. I became invested in the story and thereafter couldn't put it down. I think the characters could have used a little more development but, in the end, I guess that really didn't matter .
works; but not what is pictured! what i received is bigger than the one pictured! I just hope the plastic hold up .
i did not found it on my pc. on the same day i cancel this purchase all steps have been followed and amazon approved that they return me back the money then at ON my account it was claim. it is unfair and now i don't know where is this product and how to use it. when i try to read the book on by pc thethey are.  say it's only a sample and all this had not been mention before.how dare they are one 3-4 pgs available as sample not the whole book for this price .
I bought the first season used for a present. I love this show, I got it faster than expected and haven't watched them yet but they were all there and it looked brand new .
Loved itThe price was right and my son loves it couldn't find it in CanadaI recommend it to Thomas lovers eveywhere .
Easy peel and stick! Love it and its great for lost fans everywhere, not to much color that would make your car look tacky .
Wow!!!! What a great read!!!!  I love a book that pulls me into the story by the first or second page.  Couldn't put it down till I finished it.  Characters are believable,  enough sexual overtones to make it interesting, but not trashy.  No cussing, just a good romance novel.  I suggest you buy all of them because all the characters are woven throughout .  Made me wish it was a TV series so I could watch it next week .
I really hoped for something more. Its a very slow developing love story with a nice end... But still, at some points, it becomes kinda boring. Wouldn't recoment to buy the DVD, just to rent it for a rainy afternoon or slow weekend .
I have been working out for years and have tried some pre-workout supplements. I really like the results that I have received while using Thrive. You don't get the jittery feeling that you get from the rest of them and I feel like I can workout for twice as long. I feel energized and can really pump out those last reps. I have seen some very good gains in my strength because of thrive and I recommend it to everyone who needs a pre-workout supplement .
This headset works better then turtle beach cause I had turtle beach but the day I got tritton there is not a better headset then tritton out there .
This is and amazing printer for the price for regular people to print on regular basis. It is not a pro, said that I give it 5 stars .
I had actually purchased this for my boyfriend, and despite not being a large fan of computer games, he absolutely adores this game. Since it arrived in the mail, he has been glued to it nearly 24/7. An exaggeration but it gets the point across. It provides creativity that I have not seen for quite some time; allowing you to completely customize your creature, letting it go through evolution, and eventually even creating your own world .
The detail is beautiful and I personally love how it looks on my finger, despite the small band, but this is NOT Sterling Silver! I have worn plenty of Sterling Silver in my life-time and never before has it turned my finger green after a duration of its wear. If I had known previously that the material was not true then I would not have purchased this ring .
The whole barrette looks cheaply made and the ones I received do not have the design as it is shown. Instead of there being the separate swirls (which make the design) it is instead a solid peace with &#34;bumps&#34; as the design. I do not recommend anyone to purchase this .
Works great...to be honest, I was doubtful due to the price. I have a Canon grip on my 7D, so I really have something (OEM) to compare. No complaints. Looks, functions, and feels like my Canon grip. This one is on my 5D Mark III. I will post later on if there is a problem with the grip .
It never ceases to astound me how a book, whether it's thirteen pages or over a thousand, can resonate within you and leave you with one word on your lips: &#34;Wow.&#34;That was my reaction after reading &#34;The Book Thief&#34; by Markus Zusak. My next thoughts were of handing the book to my dad with that wide-eyed look of conviction and simply saying, &#34;Read this.&#34; Coming just under seven hundred pages, Mr. Zusak has woven together a tale of sorrow, friendship, and discovery, and it is these elements combined with the incredible characters and haunting imagery that make this book a masterpiece. Even the most proficient reader will find themselves needing to just sit back and reflect on what they just read. Although it was a bit difficult to wrap my head around the first few pages, once I got into the rhythm it was easy to see things the way the author wanted you to see them: characters, expressions, colors.Read &#34;The Book Thief.&#34; Read it and don't look back, because once you begin this journey, the only way you will want to go is forward .
From ancestral history to childhood bullying, from unexpected visitors to new opportunities, Karen Malena brings us the memoirs of Kate, a writer for The Times as she recalls past troubles and prepares for future ones. Touching and inspirational, captivating and original, Kate is someone we can all draw strength from as her trials remind us of the courage we draw from one another as well as the assurance that we will not face tribulations alone .
In this handful of short stories, Mark Venturini gives us a taste of the darker side of fantasy. With captivating tales of life, death, and renewal, Mark demonstrates his natural gift for weaving words like a tapestry, and his vivid imagery does not disappoint.If you have never read Mark Venturini's book &#34;Whispers from Forbidden Earth,&#34; then the first short story, &#34;Passing of Things,&#34; will give you unique insight into one of the characters from that book. Indeed, one of the most fascinating things about this story is seeing how the character was before he even met the elf and young boy from Chicago.&#34;If Only to Say Goodbye&#34; was the story that had me on the edge of my seat wondering, &#34;Will he say it? Will he succeed?&#34; It is an impressive feat to create such a story that leaves the reader guessing until the last moment... and then surprises you at the end.A few sweet words, peace for a grieving widow, and one chance to gently calm the sting of guilt. Such is the state of &#34;Away&#34;.&#34;Severed Roots&#34; was probably my favorite story out of the lot, albeit it had moments that made me shiver. While the darkness may be too mature for middle-grade readers, it is appropriate for the story, and in my opinion was constructed artfully .
Although there are some Biblical advice on the subject, the author does not take full advantage of his personal experience to empower others overcome their anxiety. The approach of using it to propel forward is rather controversial in that not all manifestations of anxiety can be considered positive to those around that suffer it.Due to his background as a therapist, the author finalizes by recommending professional advice, which many readers might not have access to, being the first reason they bought this book .
To my surprise, this book was actually a good read. I enjoyed reading about the cheating situation from each side, because many books don't give us the point of view from every side. I would recommend this book .
It's not that expensive yet is as cute as can be! A must have for any animal loving iPhone consumer .
I bought this to supplement my workout. There's only so many ways to re-invent the jump rope so I wasn't expecting much.When I use it, it serves its purpose.  Every time I pull it out of my gym bag it seems to have tied itself in a knot, usually a quick fix. The beads are made from a light plastic which makes the jump rope real light. If you prefer a light jump rope than this will suffice. I actually wish it was heavier .
Easy installation.  False back was easy to implement (even though I quickly opted not to use it).The tray bottom was a little rough on my bulldogs feet but I quickly fixed that with a permanent blanket.Definitely would buy again .
They worked great. I bought them to use for my podcast of 8 years. Used them for 2 weeks, Great sound quality and audio recording quality.One day I put my laptop down and the green plugin simply broke off from the chord. Not very durable.I don't know if it was a freak accident or not, But I probably won't take another risk on these .
I bought this for my English Bulldog. I had just adopted my dog, Matilda, and she was eating the same food as my other dog (A lab) and boy was she stinking up my house with farts.I did some research and stumbled across this.  I invested in a 30 pound bag and within a day I noticed a huge difference. She was definitely digesting better and no longer forced me to breathe with my nose tucked in my shirt.Definitely recommend this to anyone who has a bulldog masking the room with silent-but-deadlies .
They look cool. I wish they had a little bit more padding in the palm. These definitely lowered my blisters from weightlifting without gloves but I actually moved on to a different pair of gloves with more padding to support me.They're okay for the price and would probably be just fine for someone who doesn't life as much as me or doesn't have blistering issues .
Fun game. Online isn't that good but Attitude Era studio mode and DLC is worth it. Well worth the $20 I paid .
The wife left me in charge of decorating the bathroom and I decided to go with a New York/City theme.  I have the walls covered in Yankee memorabilia and Giants signs.I needed a practical shower curtain that served its intended purpose but also supplemented the theme of the room.This definitely did the trick.  Easy to setup and decent price.  I opted not to use the plastic shower curtain rings that came with the order, though .
Boost Mood arrived on time and I began taking one in the morning with my breakfast. I never really had problems with mood problems, But I absolutely feel must chipper during the day. I feel like I have more energy. I have even had friends make the observation that I have been in a more radiant mood. I have recommended this to friends and family. Good stuff .
As a Giants fan living in Texas, It's hard to see my boys play.  So I got the 100 dollar deal and NFL Sunday Ticket was amazing. I hope they do it again next year.  The game itself hasn't changed much from 2013, but Madden is Madden. I stay with mostly online play and have had a blast with it .
Probably unrelated but the second day of taking the pills I experienced chest pains and went to the hospital and received an EKG, Chest XRay and blood work. I ended up being fine and there was no evidence to support a direct link. Just ironic.The doctor stated it should be fine to keep taking.  I took the pills as directed for about a week and did not see any results at all. (With diet and exercise).  I figured I'd invested enough time into the product and wanted to get rid of the chest pains.After a week of not taking them, I no longer had chest pains and lost 5 pounds.  If you know someone who has seen results from this product then definitely see if it can benefit you-- I'm just reporting what happened to me .
I enjoyed the taste of it and could see how someone uses it to sweeten coffee or what-have-you, But I don't feel like it curbed my appetite .
I love history, even though this is not true, it is an interesting look at what could have been.  The story line is keeps me guessing all the time.  The people are true and believeable.  You get so involved in their lives.  This is a one of a kind adventure .
Very helpful resource of you don't want to have to look up info in the parks on multiple websites. Helpful hints and insider info was nice to have before our trip .
They were perfect!! Even though they aren't walking shoes they're very good for business causal. I loved them. You will too .
I thought this was too cute, I had to have it. I ordered a large and it fit from my stomach down. The top kept falling. I am a 36D and it would not stay up. I couldn't risk going to a Mardi Gras party and my top stay off all night. If it actually fit true to size, this would be perfect .
eligir esta calificaci&oacute;n por que es muy  buenaa la marca (lifestyler) resistente, colores muy chulo el vendedor es muy bueno entrega a tiempo .
I ordered this for my mac seeing in the title that it said "works with mac and PC" and tried to use it but nothing happens. it came with a mini disc but MacBooks can not read them so i guess im out of luck .
Toaster works good you must grease the egg pans well or good sticks, don't use cooking spray.like it ,but it does take a lot of counter space, think I should have gotten the 2 slice option.boiling eggs is so easy too .
Tells you of all the best apps without searching yourself also one you may not have thought of before reading this book .
i have had the pleasure of seeing josh groban in concert three times...i make it a point to buy all of his music. this one did not disappoint...his writing is exceptional and his voice is second to none .
Most of the function mentioned in the demo is not working. Example I was not able to cut the onion, every after cut the orion into 2 or 3 pieces .
Sigo is very good. Fit for my usage. Handy.  I donot want to carry any portable video player. This is perfect for my travel.  Only concern is about the battery charge duration.I likes it .
Charger Stopped Working After A Few Weeks In . The Light Comes On But Doesn't Charge My Phone Anymore .
I would not recommend this game to anyone. Might as well upgrade to the 2nd one. Very disappointing, Fast shipping .
this product was a waste of money and i wished i never gotten it. the seller never communicated back and i was disappointed. it tasted like poop .
my feet is softer than ever i will never go back to my old foot scrub. i will recommend this product to people .
this firming cream is the best thing i have ever tried. in just two weeks my skin looks firmer and my cellulite don't look as bad. i am exercising and dieting so maybe that why its working a little bit faster. but i will still continue to use this product .
make makeskin look brighter every time i use it. don't use every day it will make your skin extremely dry .
this cream was okay. i think its made for someone who doesn't really have dry feet. i would recommend this to people who feet are not so dry .
I love this dvd. it is about 40+ min of insane abs. and he is not playing. after you finish working out your abs are so sore. I see my abs coming in and my waist line is trimming down. i am on a low carb diet so maybe thats why i am see results a little fast .
this product works but it works too slow. i lost only 4lb in one month. which is okay but not enough. i was taking this product with coffee bean extract. the second month i only lost 1 lb. so im just going to find something else .
I am very please to say that it does not look cheap and it is worth buying. I saw this at the mall for $40.00 and I refuse to spend thar much. I had many compliments .
i love kettle bell. in one month my body look very tone. loved how my legs looked. especially in heels. my stomach started to go down. the only thing is i didn't lose weight as fast. but i lost a lot of inches. and everyone seem to notice. paul katami make you work .
It's fine, but the color is not so adorable and it's a little big for my clothes. But after all, good product .
It says it will fit the Ottorbox, so I assumed it would also fit the Life Proof, but it's a tight squeeze for a Life Proof case.  Other than that, no complaints!  My boss likes it .
Looking for a simple external speaker for my tiny ipod.  And, although there are no color choices to choose from, it seems to do the job!  It is portable, and I hope that it works for at least 3 years .
Card received was as described, and on time.  Some previous purchases from some other sellers years ago, were not as described, and in some cases, not even worthy of selling without proper disclaimers.  However, I am happy to return to buy products of value .
Everything I researched and wanted in a set, great for the price!  Shipping was fast and their were no scratches on them, I almost didn't want to hit them .
One of my favorite shows, first episode was very enjoyable! I plan on watching the whole series, can't wait foe the next show .
There's nothing complicated about a speedlight grid, and there's no sense paying retail prices for some of the name brand items you see on store shelves.  This product will work with just about any speedlight, and the price is awesome .
I've tried to use this product with IDE drives as well as SATA drives.  Ive tried this on Windows8 as well as Windows7.  The only thing that works is a blue light on the unit itself, and I do hear the drives powering up, but other than that, NOTHING happens.  I wanted to be able to access my drives via USB 3 as my older enclosures are all USB 2.Since the product literally fails to perform what it's supposed to do, I wanted to leave it 0 stars if I could.  I wouldn't be able to say if this is a flawed product or just a DOA sample.  In any case, It didn't work for with any drive and any of my computers .
The product does exactly what it is supposed to do.  It's a medium sized stand that is really well designed.  The boom assembly can also handle the weight / load of a speedlight.  I loved the fact that I can use this product in more ways than just a reflector holder.  Just note, the stand itself is a medium duty stand, but the boom arm assembly is not designed for attaching strobes.  It is strong enough to attach a speedlight to, but that's about it.  This is not a substitute for a proper boom arm etc...I purchased two of these units and couldn't be happier.  Just a plain great product .
A card that lasts less than 50 hours of total use over the course of 15 months is just plain ridiculous.  This was a premium card when I purchased it for my workstation build.  Definitely an unpleasant surprise :(  Given that Amazon won't take the product back (past its return period), I'll have to see if the product is still under warranty and see if there's other recourse.My workstation is connected to a Dell 2713h (2560 x 1440).  This resolution is supported by the card, but perhaps the card can't handle it?  In any case, my workstation is useless now and I'm losing time having to do a lot of photo processing on the secondary laptop.Maybe the manufacturer will replace this dead card .
The way the product is described, you'd imagine it would be on par with the Otterbox Commuter or the Trident case.  It's very thin and light, and as such, does not offer the same amount of protection as the competition.  The inner sleeve is extremely thin and there's very little mass to offer any energy absorption.  The outer shell is a very thin plastic that is thinner and more flexible than the average credit card.  Is it better than nothing at all?  Yes.  Is it as protective as the Commuter or Trident?  Definitely not... far from it.If you were thinking of buying a case for your peace of mind, this is not the case to purchase.  There is just not enough mass / material to the case and sleeve to offer any impact protection .
I loved Tintin the movie . I did not think it could get any better,But I was wrong . I loved the book even more then the movie.It went in to way more detail .
It was sad for the people who died on titanic but not for Jack and Annie not to day no .
I have ordered this cable because my cable is not working properly. it's not charging my phone at all. This cable is not any different. Please do not buy .
Refreshingly honest and real.  I believed every bit of it.I intentionally made myself read in small doses so it wouldn't end to soon.  Now that's the sign of a good book .
well first thing first these real some very good screen protectors. i can't believe how much they charge for just one of these in a phone store, and you can get four of them for such a low price online, thanks for the internet!! lol .
I bought this i pad case for my daughters i pad for christmas, i was really happy when i received it. this  is a very good deal for this case, can't beat this deal, thanks alot .
I couldn't put the book down, till I finished it. Told many people about it.  It's a must read book. It made me think about many things, especially with the things that I've encountered through out my life. Wished I could buy "Heaven is for Real" and put the book in each and everyone of my friends hands to read. You just have to read the book to see what I mean.  Cindy .
When I get to the end of her books I'm not ready to say goodbye to the characters...and look for the next one .
The whole series kept me happy.  I didn't want to tell the characters goodbye and was so happy see there were more .
I guess I was looking with a closed mind because the name just didn't make me want to read the first book by her... but I'm hooked now.  I love here writing style that keeps me reading late into the night .
Love the series... love the way they are so supportive of each other.  Too bad living people can't grasp that concept .
I enjoyed this novella for what it was...a small glimpse in the day in the life..the earlier reviews prepared me for this , so I wasn't disappointed .
The title of this book hooked me. While reading the first chapter , I swore I was reading a Michael Crichton novel. This is high praise. The no holds barred science and the fast pace. Where A.G Riddle split of from a Crichton was for me the commitment to the idea that this was Atlantis. He has me convinced. Which is the mark of a good storyteller .
Better than I expected , comes with good features, delivery was slower then normal. It could be warm if your a hot person , not much airflow .
bought 2 units , internal fan on 1 unit didn't work on 120v when i switched to 2 phase it worked for about 2 mins then never worked again , they are still working 2 months later but i had to put an external fan on it as it about melted the aluminum without a fan , over all in a pinch these are ok , but plan on watching them close and haveing a backup ready .
Superb service, original manufacturer merchandise, excellent S&H. Shopping experience could not have been better. Thx. for the enjoyable purchasing milieu .
Rather you're going into full-time ministry or not this book is for you!  Steve Shadrach has the unique ability to zoom out and bring perspective into any reader.  This book allowed me to gain a proper perspective on giving and asking.  I have a deeper desire to increase my giving.  Also, having recently committed to full-time ministry, I am no longer scared or intimidated to raise my support.  Instead I am excited to devote myself to implementing the God Ask .
The Accessories were nice, however the actual case did not fit. some parts wouldn't fit right with the tablet. I know it was the right case for that tablet, so it was disappointing. I really liked the color, but the fit made it difficult to work the tablet .
The custom is good and the price is fair, but it is not comfortable. Your shoulders will hurt after a couple of hours and it is not stable it gets loose. To be fair everyone liked it .
the assembly took around 20 minutes and it was really easy, at first, I liked it a lot. However, when I tried to move it to the other room two legs broke at the same time. I did not know that I was that strong lol.It is a good product but be careful when you pull or push it .
I have tried Samsung, Apple, and BlackBerry cables and all of them do not go inside the charger. 1 star cuz it doesn't do the job .
The string was cut on the first week. The bag doesn't fit a laptop and books, it barely takes laptop with papers. Not good for students because it is too small .
it was a good movie that shows real bloody scenes. the problem is thar there is no actual story involved .
I am a makeup artist , first time ever putting a bald cap on someone. This was semi easy, very good step by step guide , photos included were a big help. I would highly recommend this item. This is a hint if u haven't worked with liquid latex before it dries very quickly and i found it was easier to paint it on with the brush rather than to sponge it on , when they say sharp scissors they mean it .
This bag is cute, lots of room inside.  I like that it gives you three ways to carry it.  I have not used the bag yet but for the price you cannot go wrong, would recommend .
Its a cute bag, lots of room.  I have not used it yet so I couldn't tell you if it will last you a long time but for the price I would be happy to get a season out of it .
Really cute, fun hat, I ordered for my vacation when I went to the beach, shopping and it fit perfectly, not bad for the price, would recommend .
These fit me but I would go smaller if I ordered more.  They fit good with jeans or shorts but didn't feel comfortable with a dress, maybe a smaller size would work.  I would still recommend .
Product arrived about a week late. When it came it was in a cover with a label saying it was bought used on GameStop, the disc itself had some sort of white marks on, and could not be read even after numerous attempts .
The app won't log in using Facebook. It works fine if you use a Yahoo account, but not Facebook. The app is nice otherwise. Too bad my flickr is only associated with my Facebook account. Please fix .
The painting on these is not the greatest, but they worked well for cupcake toppers.  I used these and banana runts and they turned out perfect .
I love the product, it works great!  However, I ordered a medium for my 18 pound son and it just fits.  I don't think he will get to wear it much...wish the sizing was accurate and I would have ordered the large .
These are the perfect little boy socks!  Will definitely buy more of these.  Many socks are too tight for my son's ankles (and he's not even chubby), but these fit perfectly .
Bought these for my nephew and one didn't work when he got it and the other lasted less than a month .
Only 1 port works. Pointless to have an adapter that doesn't completely work. Would have given it a 0 but it wasn't an option .
Cord works for about 3 weeks, then miraculously decides to not work any longer. I ordered 2 of them and they both did the same thing .
I bought this card because it was a tad cheaper than the Nvidia card I had recently checked out. Now I haven't bought a Radeon card in 10 years because they have always had problems when it comes to gaming. I thought by now they would be better, but once again I was wrong. After several days of tweaking settings, messing with drivers, and doing numerous benchtests I came to the conclusion that this card was outperformed by my Nvidia GeForce GT 430 which was released in 2010. If you are a gamer I highly suggest that you put Radeon out of your mind and go for an Nvidia card. Thats what I intend to do as soon as I return this piece and get my money back .
The cane was great. Went with the costume really well. Only wish it was a stronger plastic, couldn't put much weight on it without it bending/ But other than that, it was great .
I just purchased this product last week starting using it  right away. it works great. I am an installer and i had used a more expensive test Monitor but i didn't like the fact that it works on double AA batteries. this AGP product uses a rechargeble battery pack . its really easy to use. i would give a Five Star if it would come with a BNC to BNC patch cord cable. It would be nice to have a larger display like a 3.5 or a 4.5 .
I could not put this book down.  It was written with clarity, simplicity, knowledge and a relatively current  time frame.  Hurry and make a movie of it...people in the USA  need to read it .
This book was rather good..I like happy endings and it didn't disappoint.  I shall read more of Stewart's books.. The romances seemed rather contrived, but warmed the heart .
It explained some things to me that I needed to know about people.  Sometimes people you know and like for YEARS do such weird things!! This taught me about them.  Sometimes they twist things around so it almost seems like their actions are someone else's fault.  Not so.... good informative book .
I enjoyed this book..no knives, machetes, cross-bows, bombs , etc. , Ad nauseam.  Sweet story.  Basic love story under the absolute worst of situations..more please..add natural  country phenomenon in conjunction with the main story line..cross story events or other settings to further complicate the book..good .
Very nearly pornographic..please don't write any more of this for youngsters to brag about.....directions how to ruin one's life.  Not a good read .
Good suggestions for baking in the skillet. Liked apple cake..not so many cornbread ingredients ,please..mixes are too handy-- not bedtime reading I guess .
The book did a good job bringing out things to be thankful for, but the rhyming meter was not smooth for me to read and we spend a lot of time reading aloud each day.My three year old liked the dinosaur as the main character since he loves dinosaurs. My six year old found it a bit simplistic and the pictures were not very impressively illustrated.As a whole package the book is ok and helps if you are trying to illustrate things to be thankful for .
This filter was not available locally. Found it on the makers website for almost 3x the price. This one fit perfectly in air ionizer and is doing the job .
I have tech support workshop and I have seen 3 of this laptops with motherboard problems, all of them less than 2 years old, don't waste your money .
WARNING THIS ALBUM ROCKS.IF YOU DON'T LIKE GOOD MUSIC DO NOT BUY!!!! I love all the songs this has got to be the best Blackfoot album ever if not the best rock album ever IT ROCK. If you like rock n roll you have to BUY THIS .

Crap not even close to 1 star ... Ok so I got this case for my ipad 2 !! It was the best thing ever !! 8 months down the road it sucks .. It's broke .. It's weird it's not that pretty ... And so on . But it was a nice stand for movies .. But 50$ what !! I can't believe I would spend money like that . Lucky I didn't buy it . Well on to pros and consConsUglyBrakes easyKinda hard to turn into a standFeels cheapAnd can't it at least be like ....

Good ipod for some one on a budget !! But the voice over controls kinda suck .. I was told that it would go to my playlists, but instead of my playlist names it says "playlist one,playlist 2" and so on ... It's so hard to remember whats what &#128546; . I think for the money you should be buy something better .. Like for 50$ you can buy a mp3 with 4gb - that's 2+gb's more then this ipod. A radio and a nice REALL SCREEN !!!! But if your a die hard apple fan this will work .. It won't brake but it will suck on some stuff ...Pros and consConsNo screenVoice control sucksStatic when running50$ for 2gb- about 200-300 songsSong skip when running ..APPLE .. No apple rocks just not for cheap stuff ..ProsAlmost Unbreakable !!!Nice look !!Small !!So it's your choice .. If the cons don't matter to you and/or if you just want something with a apple on it ... Go get one !! But if I was you I would save up your next paycheck and get the itouch 5 !! But it's good just needs a upgrade .
I had been chomping at the bit to do something for some friends of ours because I hate worry without action. So I decided I would cook a few meals for them that I could freeze.Unfortunately, I am a bit scatter-brained when it comes to multi-tasking. So making two lasagnas (one for them, one for us) is a lot for my brain to handle. I had an assembly line going for each pan, and was listening to the Bose using the remote I had on the counter above my workstation.While assembling, I knocked a bunch of stuff off the top counter (including the Bose remote) and onto the floor. Picked it all up, or so I thought, and then covered both lasagnas with tin foil and put them in to bake.While they were baking, I realized that I couldn't find the Bose remote. I looked everywhere; even searched the trashcan three times.When the oven timer went off, I stopped my frantic search to remove the tin foil from both pans..and VOILA!There was the remote, lying on top of one of the lasagnas. Face down, cooked for 30 minutes at 350 degrees.And what do you know - the remote still works! THANK YOU BOSE FOR MAKING A FOOL-PROOF PRODUCT .
i got this for my kids and they loved it....they said it has pllenty of space and have no complaints .
my boyfriend has been wearing these shoes for years and very dissapointed they are not makingthem anymore, looked everywhere and found them on amazon, thank God! Cause he won't wear anythingelse, don't know what we will do when they are all gone .
There are many cases that don't protect as well and cost much more. I would recommend this case for any iPhone user .
I wish I would have waited until it hit bookshelves because I would not have had to add shipping and handling charges and I would also have received 10% off the price due to my rewards card from the bookstore ..oh well ..other wise it is a fun read .
I love George R.R. Martin I have read a few of his books mostly the Ice and Fire related ones so I thought I would try his non Ice and Fire books.. I loved Twilight Zone and Beauty and the Beast I watched them faithfully so I just figured this had to be as good... I was also surprised it was a trade paperback as I thought I was ordering a mass paperback which is probably my fault for not reading closely enough... but to tell the truth it really does not matter what form it comes in it is George .
I liked this product it was delivered quickly an is a sturdy product it is made of a tin or steel or aluminum something strong ..to be honest I haven't taken it out of it's plastic yet .
I already own this exact design on a t-shirt however I was, again, surprised that this one did not fit the same.  So I checked the tag and low and behold they are different and this one fits a bit larger than the one it was to replace .
It is not what I thought it was. I was expecting a more detailed account but this only has a few lines to maybe a paragraph per page .
Loved it, so worth the read, couldn't out it down. I was up until 2 one night, just couldn't put it down .
I loved this book and was very disappointed when it ended. I just couldn't put it down it was spine chilling, enthralling and so hard to leave. I hated it when it ended I wanted it to go on .
Another grate read from David Johnson, read it in 2 days and I work full time. I just hope there will be another in the Tucker series soon. This series just reels you in and you can't wait for more .
i purchased these 2 camera's based on amazon saying they were compatible with any motorola MBP36 unit, they are not and now i have 2 cameras that don't work, thanks very much .
I can't see exceeding the 22 pound weight limit, but that is the one drawback if there is one.  Other than that, the screw-clamp does its job enthusiastically, holding the table firmly. there is absolutely no wiggle in the screen when I bump the table.  Impressive .
One of those games u don't get bored of that easy. When u do it doesn't last long..really love the game .
Not really all that much to say about this movie or the series as a whole. Terrible acting coupled with terrible CGI made for a terrible movie. Basically there were a bunch of new characters, added to an already awkward and unappealing cast, to serve essentially no end. I don't think I know of any worse vampire movies and as a vampire fan its a let down. Thanks Stephanie Meyer for taking a fun, under-appreciated concept and turning it into a train wreck.Also, what the hell was with that battle scene? Heads just popped off like they were lego pieces! Why bother getting a bunch of super powerful vampires just to have it turn into a fist fight and only use powers once half the people were dead?Just absolutely awful .
I love this cell phone cover.It`s a very good quality product and gets lots of compliments. No problems so far .
Works the first time out of the box on off brand android 4.04 tablets.  I have not review all parts of this app only the QR reader.Great software .

My three year old son has memorized many of the rhymes in this book. I even enjoy reading these. There are so many in this book that I have never even heard of.  I will be giving this as gifts at many baby showers .
did not expect such great sound from a pretty cheaply priced radio, stations are easy to navigate,bright red  on/off lever is in the front which is great, eliminates fumbling around looking for the switch in the dark .
the rip in the fabric  that appeared after having it for approximately 3 weeks is the reason for the low rating--if I did this review a week ago I would have probably rated it 3 1/2 stars--didn't care for the fake pocket snaps on the top pockets, I carry my wallet/iphone in front pockets and would have wanted something which closed more securely .
If you love Fifty shades of grey. you will love this book.  I actually like Eva over Ana anyway! I couldn't put it down .
It will require you to update it, if not used often. (This may be a security feature). Otherwise, it's super .
Its ok just not what i expected i was thought it was better thN this but its ok im not thT big of a fane .
I could not put this book down. I think she is so amazing! After reading this book I feel like I've known her for a long time. I would meet her If I could but I do live in yamhill and I've seen her old house. Because I live really close. If she still lived in the house I would ask her why she writes so good. I really think she is a good writer. If you haven't had a chance to read this book you should,because when you finish this you could tell people that Beverly clearly did this and that .
If you don't have this game you need to get it. I love how it looks real. I just love the horses .
Out of all the games I have this one is my most favorite and my dad loves it too and so does my mom.If I could say one thing about this game there would be no negatives thanks for a good game .
This emblem gave my car a unique look compared to most I've seen. The red inlay is definitely a conversation starter, and I've had nothing but compliments .
I bought this without high expectations, but I was still let down. If you have scraps - and by scraps I mean less than 12" pieces - you will use this. The plastic organizer is really small. The actual spooler is teeny tiny, but wraps scraps ok. I read that it was small,  but I guess I thought it wouldn't be child size .

A value for money product, this case will serve for a long time, even after you do not own your iPhone.The only problem with this case is that it is definitely not as sleek and modern looking as most other iPhone cases on the market today. So you will have to sacrifice protection for style but the choice is yours .
I have been managing my online job fairly well, but then I realized that I may need something to monitor the kids while the house help was away. I browsed the internet and found the wireless video cam from Dropcam. This was pretty convenient too as you could stream video images from it not only through the computer, it can be compatible with other devices such as smartphones too; you just have to have Wi-Fi connection. It also sends prompt alerts and it is user-friendly as well. I think the most wonderful feature of this product is its night vision feature. I have spent money on several products which I have used before, but they weren't able to compare with this one. It has been very useful for me, I bet it would be for everyone who decide to use it too. Go get it .
Wow! I have found that out of all of the ketones products that the teraputics brand works the best for me and the fact that I can get 2 bottles of the product for less than what I would pay for the others is a great aspect as well.One of the biggest reasons that I went with this brand was because I found that if you have high blood pressure the other products cause issues and the teraputics brand does not which is a plus for me. You can be sure that I will be telling everyone I know about this product and how much it has helped me in a short time .
I used a Panasonic EV series massager before. Compared to Panasonic, it is shorter in length, and so, difficult to reach lower back. Its wider than Panasonic and the base is very thick. I will rate it a little higher than Panasonic on the massage front. Works pretty well. Due to the rounded massage heads, it slips smoothly onto crevices, giving more pleasure. However as the length is short you feel the vibration on your hands and it becomes difficult to hold on after a few minutes. Panasonic did not have this problem. Overall a very good sturdy product, but may not be he best in the market .
WOW! This was such a powerful, emotional, heart wrenching book. I laughed and I cried, mostly just cried!It was not the love story I was expecting it to be, but I absolutely loved it!I didn't read the synopsis before starting this book. I simply was in search for a good romance that would make me cry.. so on a recommendation, I bought it. $14.99 at the time, which to me was outrageous for an ebook. I was SO not disappointed. Not anticipating what was to come, I was floored with the raw power of this book.I literally cried non stop while reading, then I cried for days after, just thinking about it!A must read .
I loved this story SO much!! I was laughing from the beginning. I laughed, I swooned, I cringed, I cried! It can't get any better than that! Ok well the editing and grammar we'll talk about in a minute..Elli and Shea meet when Elli was hired to photograph Shea's hockey team, The Assassins. But Elli knows exactly who Shea is. He's her favorite player. She wears his number, his jersey and has his pictures on her wall!Elli is beautiful, shy, funny, successful, caring and a size 10! She thinks she is average, over weight, and nothing special.She is gorgeous, famous and a ladies man. He is also goofy, wears glasses, loves kids and his family.Elli is nothing like the women he usually "dates" but he falls for her and he falls hard!This story was awesome. I loved what a great bond Shea had with his sister and his family. They were sweet and funny. Shea was amazing! So sweet, thoughtful and loving. Very swoon worthy!!Elli's family (not all) was terrible and their antics were just heart breaking.Elli was so insecure and unsure of herself. I felt awful for her. At the same time she was unique, original and a very refreshing character! I loved her!I loved the secondary characters as well. There were many, but they all made the story worth while.Now, onto the grammar and editing. OMG terrible!! The misuse of your and you're as well as then and than just killed me! I'm not an English major by any means but by God do I know the difference! Also the editing was atrocious! I sure hope Toni Aleo's other books were edited by a different person because I LOVE her writing and I WILL read more!!That is the only reason I am not giving Taking Shots 5 stars, even though I really want to .
I knew what I was in for before I started. A.L. Jackson always writes beautiful stories of love, strength and loss. Therefore I was not shocked when she had me crying! As a matter of fact I was expecting it!!How did I get so lucky to receive an advanced copy?? Bless you A.L. Jackson!Come to Me Quietly is a beautifully written story of friends turned lovers.This story is filled with tenderness, heartbreak and love.Told in dual pov (which is the best), mostly told in the present tense with flashbacks to when they were kids.With the flashbacks, you get a glimpse at the sweet and innocent boy Jared once was. He was always taking care of Aly, watching over her and loving her. I LOVED the way he would hold onto a piece of her hair!! So sweet!Jared now is a broken and damaged man. He isn&#8217;t worthy of love, friendship, trust or even a happy life. At least that&#8217;s how he sees himself. He is in purgatory and must pay for his sins!Aly is beautiful, sweet and pure. She embodies everything he cannot have. She also reminds him every day of his past life. How it felt to be loved, happy and carefree.He struggles with his feelings, wanting her and knowing there's no way in hell he can have her.Despite the shocking tragedies and tortured character, I found the story sweet and easy going. The shock and tears came much later in the story, almost at the end. That's when she hits you with it all at once!Not a cliffhanger per say... but you are sort of left hangin'!Can't wait to find out where the journey leads in Come to Me Softly.*I received an advanced copy provided by A.L. Jackson and NetGalley in exchange for an honest review .
3-3.5 StarsI was SO waiting for this and had to psych myself up to read today. I was so scared! I didn't want my heart to be torn to pieces!! River or Ben? Who would she choose??? What would happen?Well, I was fine. No tears, no freak-outs. I was a tad disappointed actually.Don't get me wrong, I did enjoy the story and the way things ended.. but although there was a hell of a lot of drama, revelations and surprises.. I still overall was left feeling let down.There was also a lot going on! It seemed like every supporting character had their own mini story line.Lots of arguing and lots of sex. I admit that I skimmed over several sex scenes just to get to the end. I know, shame on me.As far as Ben, River and Dahlia go...I didn't care for Dahlia too much this time around or her actions. I also wasn't happy knowing Ben's pov. That's terrible I know, I should have felt bad for his situation, but I didn't. I guess I'm team River all the way!Regardless of not absolutely loving Torn, I will definitely continue reading the series. Bring on Xander .
Ella Frank, I think I love you!I laughed, I cried, I got all hot and bothered!Lena is a very successful and beautiful doctor.. but she isn't happy, in any sense of the word. She's uptight, cranky, alone and harbors terrible guilt.Mason is a hot, Casanova, restaurant owner who just so happens to have his sights set on the sexy doctor.I really enjoyed the sexual tension between the two. The little innuendos, phone conversations and the PEACH!!! HOLY HOTNESS! I never wanted to eat a peach so bad in my life!On the other hand, I don't know how I stopped crying long enough to enjoy the hotness of this book. The tragic past Lena reveals as well as Mason's loss had me bawling!Exquisite has everything a great book should have! A must read!Ahem.... the bathroom scene after their run.... UGH! Wet! Very wet .
2.5-3 starsNot quite sure about this one. I read it, all of it.. even though at times I was shaking my head wondering why I was still reading.I did enjoy the fact that this story was different. I like superheros! I'm just not sure about the rest of it. Too strange, twisted and all over the place. Frankly I didn't care for Cataline at all. Love her name though .
3 starsSo I'm on the fence about this one. Most of the time I enjoyed it, but I was left feeling stumped. Did I like it, or not?This started out your typical student/teacher romance but it didn't quite have that forbidden feel to it as others I've read. Both Ryan and Kate have old issues that hinder their feelings and actions.I really liked Ryan's Raven which was told before the story started, in Ryan's pov. It was funny and sad.Ryan in the beginning seems like a bit of an arrogant ass, but because of his past seems a bit justified. Throughout the story he shows his kinder caring side and I liked him a lot.Kate is a bit of a contradiction and seems wishy washy. On one hand she's strong and independent, a real "don't take no shit from anyone" kind of girl but then on the other she's nave and too trusting of others.I enjoyed the flirtation between Kate and Ryan in the beginning. Also, I especially liked Carter and Dean's antics. They brought some good humor to the story.Once Kate and Ryan got together, it seemed they jumped right into a relationship and the author skipped over their getting to know each other phase. It also sometimes felt rushed, especially the ending.A couple of shocking moments took place that I so was not expecting. One in particular was a complete betrayal, but then it seemed as though the characters just brushed it off as nothing happened and then it zoomed right to the end to a HEA!? Really? I mean, I wanted a happy ending, but I needed a little more. That's where the wishy washy came back into play.It was a good story with parts that I liked, but also parts that didn't make sense. Now I feel like my review is one big contradiction!You also get a sneak peak into the next book. WTH? I really liked Ryan in Preservation but am not sure if I like what I read in Reservation. It made my stomach flop!*I received an arc from NetGalley in exchange for an honest review .
WTF?? First of all, let me say that I had no clue there were two versions of this book. I didn't read the note "From the Author" in the Amazon description.SO... I started reading the Sexy version... yummy! Loved the story, yada yada yada.. will get to that part in a minute.. got all into it, says I'm at 50% and I'm STOKED, cause it just got good.. and BAM! it's over. I turned the page and it's the secend version.. Sexy-Lite!! WHAT?? Crap! Was a little disappointed, but that just means I need book 2! There is a book 2 right??SO... I LOVED Tall, Tatted and Tempting! Logan is beautiful, sexy, tender, loving, tatted, and deaf!! I have not read a romance story where the hero had an imparement and I SO love him. He was strong and confident, but sensitive and vulnerable.He would always touch her, he could feel the vibration in her throat when she'd make noises or speak, look at her face to face to read her lips and see her emotions!! UGH it was so intimate!The writing was beautiful!Kit (Emily) was hiding something, and I was thinking up the craziest scenarios. Probably because she said she "wasn't free" and after having reads several slave related books I thought "oh my gosh", did I miss that in the synopsis?? But she wasn't a slave, at least, not like that.Kit was a very well rounded character. She was strong, talented, not a slut or a virgin, she clearly needed help but wasn't the usual damsel in distress. And I loved that she also had somewhat of a disability. The interactions between her and Haley were adorable and sweet.Matt!! UGH! It brought tears to my eyes!!!!There's SO much emotion in this book that I don't know if I can get it all out.It was funny, sexy, sweet, sad, loving, etc etc etc!!The brothers!!! Each one of them embodied all those things and each one should have a book of their own! I hope so and I can't wait!!This really was a great little book. It made me laugh, it had me tearing up, Logan had me swooning... but I wanted more .
Here we go again! UGH Another 2.5 stars for me. Why?? I was SO excited to read Stripped!I'm not sure what I was expecting, but it just didn't do it for me.I'm not really revealing Spoilers, but maybe just slightly, so read on at your own risk...Ok, so it started out sweet and innocent, with Grey as a shy, naive teenage Pastor's daughter inlove with dance....goes into her being a struggling college student on her own, desperately needing a job and becoming a stripper!She meets this hot actor one night at the club and has an instant connection... next thing you know, like 2 DAYS later, BAM they're together and professing their undying love to each other! WHAT?? It wasn't even a week!! Needless to say, she goes from being a naive virgin to not!! I know she was exploring and all, but maybe a little too much information about what his junk looks like? Maybe it was just me.There's really not much about the stripping.. not much about her in school either..Then it LEAPS to the future, without warning, and turns into a porno! Well, not really, but kind of gets a little boring and is just about sex, then more sex and sex again. Not too much story really. Then it was over. :(I was a little disappointed, but then again, everyone has their own opinion and you might love it .
Kitt is a yummy rough and tough cowboy, taking care of his father's ranch and family after his death and...buried in the closet!Austin is an A-list actor at the top of his prime and engaged to be married to a beautiful actress. Unfortunately, Austin is burnt out of the Hollywood life, glitz and glamor and especially of hiding who he really is. He's ready to live a peaceful, quiet life back in Texas where he grew up.Austin ends up buying land from Kitt essentially becoming his next-door neighbor. Unbeknownst to them, they each harbor some deep rooted feelings dating back to their high school days. Neither man knows the fantasies each other have nor do they know the other is gay!I liked Kitt and Austin's story, but there was just something missing to make me completely love it.There was drama, love, sex, surprises and revelations...but I needed more. More what? I'm not sure. It was all there and lots of it.. I just needed more! Less storyline and more passion and feelings maybe? I also found quite a few editing errors.All is all, I enjoyed it and will definitely read more from Kindle Alexander .
LOVE LOVE LOVED it!!The synopsis is but a peek into the story. There is so much more to it than that.Jace, an openly gay cheerleader has admired the "straight" , star quarterback Colt from afar for years now. What he didn't know was that Colt has also been admiring Jace. He's pretty much been stalking lusting after him since the first day he saw him. He knows everything there is to know about Jace, yet they've never spoken. Colt decides that time is running out, the end of school is near and he might never have a chance with Jace again.. so he goes for it. And holy hell does he go for it!!!The story starts out with a bang! Literally!! I was hooked right away and loved every word! Speaking of banging... DAYUM It was hot!!But that was just the beginning. There is SO much that happens!!What a beautiful journey of love and lust, heartbreak and agony.Hatred rips their lives apart, but true love always finds a way.I laughed and I cried!! Great read!! Can't wait for more .
*I received an arc in exchange for an honest reviewThis was definitely not your typical kind of love story. I am a little torn on how to rate it though. The book flowed nicely and was written well, it was just different.Awkward, nerdy freshman Samantha gets somewhat obsessed with hot, popular junior Delaney. I wasn't happy about a lot of Samantha and Delaney's interactions especially the way he treated her at school. Their relationship was just odd.It's also about Samantha's parents and their past love triangle. They end up introducing Samantha's biological father/third party of their triangle into her life.I found Samantha's family dynamic to be very refreshing. They are very open with their daughters, never shying away from discussing embarrassing or awkward topics. I enjoyed that very much.In the end, HEA, as much as Delaney could give...which surprisingly was more than I expected. I liked how it ended .
I received an arc in exchange for an honest review.This was a sweet story of love and forgiveness. From the very beginning I thought, what are they both hiding? What's going to happen? But there were no tears or huge reveals.Although filled with secrets, drama, loss, abuse.. it was somewhat subdued for me.Still, I thought it was a good easy going read.Great quotes from the book.."love is something you don't throw away, because you'll never know when you'll see it again.""saving them won't save you." "the only person you can save is yourself .
I received a copy of What Once Was Perfect in exchange for an honest review...What happens when you find yourself face to face with "the one that broke your heart"?Honestly, this book made me feel like I was watching a Lifetime movie, but with better sex!What I mean is, there wasn't terrible angst, drama or tears, no in depth history or action, just an easygoing sweet and sexy love story about reconnecting.I enjoyed the small town vibe, the nosey neighbors and the love in Laney's family. Kyle and Laney had great chemistry and I liked what a great "man" Kyle was. (he's a teacher, he's renovating an old house, he likes to cook, loves his friends and family, wants to be there to rub her feet when she gets home from work, and he's hot! What more could you ask for?)Overall I enjoying reading it .
This is actually only my second biker book and it met all my stereotypical biker expectations. Jail, trailer parks, guns, booze, skanks, short skirts, raunchiness, hot as hell sex and hot alpha men on bikes!What surprised me was the abundance of love and tenderness, close family bond and the incorporation of a military tradition. Being a military wife, that unexpected moment hit home and was very emotional for me.I found Horse to be very likable! Yes he&#8217;s a big, bad biker who sometimes scares the s*** out of you but he&#8217;s also a good, kindhearted and sensitive man who loves his family. What&#8217;s wrong with that?The Reaper&#8217;s world is unlike any I know and like Marie, I cringed at the word &#8220;property&#8221; as I did with &#8220;sweet butt&#8221; and &#8220;old lady&#8221;. Still gives me the shivers just thinking about it! But, Horse&#8217;s explanation made sense and damned if I wouldn't mind being considered his property .
WOW! Just WOW!!Forbidden is a beautifully written story of sadness, family and love.I don't want to give anything away to future readers.. just know that all I knew before I started was brother and sister who fall in love and be ready to cry! That's enough right? It was for me and it will be for you!-&#34;I refuse to let labels from the outside world spoil the happiest day of my life.The day we finally broke free of our restraints and gave way to the feelings we had so long denied just because we happened to be brother and sister.&#34;-I found myself rooting so hard for Lochan and Maya despite being siblings. This story messed with my brain!Yes this is ultimately about the love between a brother and sister, but there is so much more than that.I felt so deeply for this family of five children, especially Lochan. He was carrying the weight of the world on his shoulders and it was breaking him. It was breaking me reading it.Even with all the sadness and heartbreaking moments I wasn't crying tears! :(I made it all the way to 85% and then the dam broke!!I was flabbergasted at what was happening and was kicking myself for wondering where my tears had previously been. They caught up to me and didn't stop until the very last sentence. More than once I gasped in shock while continuing to cry.I woke up the next morning immediately thinking of what happened and why???!!!Why did it have to happen this way? Why couldn't things have been different?This beautiful story will have you turning the events over in your mind for days after.A must read in my opinion .
I loved Cara McKenna's After Hours and was beyond excited to read Unbound. She's done it again for me, but I have to tell you, this was a different kind of romance.And holy crap, I was so not expecting Rob's &#34;hidden desires&#34; to be what they were!! Talk about unpredictable!Merry is quite the character. I enjoyed her internal dialogue very much. She had me laughing a lot!Rob, I just felt bad for. He was lonely, afraid, unsure and unhappy with himself. Fortunately for him, Merry came along turning his views and his world upside down. For Merry, Rob was a strong, intriguing, gorgeous gentleman who she couldn't get enough of.Although I was happy with the ending, I was looking forward to more. A glimpse into the future with an Epilogue would have been nice, but there wasn't one .
hmph Let's just say, it wasn't my favorite.I really enjoyed both Beautiful Bastard and Beautiful Stranger. I liked how the four previous characters were present in Beautiful Player, giving you a little added bonus.I also LOVE his and her pov style!That being said, Hanna "Ziggy" and Will's story just didn't do it for me like the others.I mean, at times... oh it "did it" for me for sure. There were some pretty H A W T moments throughout the story, but overall I wasn't that impressed with the rest.It was funny, steamy, a little angsty, but also irritating and I found Ziggy to be a little annoying and dumb for being so damn smart.Ziggy is a 24 year old lab rat, convinced by her brother that she needs to get out more and experience life. She ends up contacting her brother's best friend Will (bad boy/player/pussy expert)and deciding he'd be the perfect person to teach her how to date a.k.a. get laid!Ok, this is where she goes from being an outspoken intelligent woman to being a nave imbecile. She had sex with 5 people, 8 times, yet she still has absolutely no idea what or how to do it? She had way too many questions about the actual act.And for being SO outspoken and honest, neither one of them knew how to communicate worth a damn .
I had such high expectations for LD, but wasn't completely blown away. :(Don't get me wrong, I liked it.. but can't say I LOVED it like I did Flat Out Love.True there was a lot of loss, anger, sadness, love, friendship, some steamy moments, some funny and that much anticipated Holy SH@# moment at 70% that I heard SO much about...but although I wasn't expecting it, I thought it would be a bigger moment. I got teary eyed, that's for sure.. but it didn't last long.Still, I enjoyed it and will forever LOVE Jessica Park .
I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review...After reading the synopsis, I thought this was going to be a story of how this girl's life is now, in the present, with this unbelievably hot famous actor, that she once knew from high school. A kind of "The Mighty Storm" type of book.Well, it's not!It's actually the back story from when they met and how their lives were, back in high school, back in 1990. There is nothing about present day in this book... but lucky for me, and all of you, there is in the sequel! :)This was a cute story that made me laugh, had me reminiscing about my teenage/high school years with the references to Aqua Net and scrunchies, and also had me tearing up on a few seperate occasions. There was just enough angst without it being too much and also a couple steamy scenes!Not only was it focused on Layla and Trip's relationship, but also on the friendships and bonds that were made throughout Layla's life and the inevitablility of moving forward and moving on!I really enjoyed this book and will definitely read the next one .
I went into this knowing full well that this was a short novella in a series of many. That is not why it was just &#34;ok&#34; for me.I was pretty excited to read a book named &#34;Beg&#34;. Urgh... yeah, I'll beg!!But although there were a couple of steamy moments, I've already forgotten them!Also &#34;If you loved FSOG or Crossfire series, you'll love Beg&#34; says Amazon...Why, because he told her to put her hands behind her back? nah I didn't see it.There is nothing wrong with this novella nor is it a terrible read by any means. I was just not kept fully interested in the characters, main or secondary. We got a little bit of insight into each character but not enough of the main characters as I need, to be emotionally invested in them.*Arc provided by NetGalley in exchange for an honest review .
3 StarsTragic past, hot, sexy, Milan!! Sounds good right?? Well, most of it was good.. but with a little less info and a bit more emotion and follow thru, it could have been awesome.Tragedy strikes at the very beginning. The story starts with a teenage Erin being dealt a harsh hand. We resume the story five years later when Erin and Alek meet for the first time.Alek Dostov is a Russian/American child prodigy and Maestro at just 23. Erin Angelo is now a 21 year old American, up and coming clothing designer living and working in Milan.They both come with a lot of baggage and secrets.The story was filled with sexual tension, intrigue, danger, humor, and love. There was also an array of talent. (musicians, dancers, singers, artists, designers.... and Erin, could do it all)Unfortunately, it was all a bit muted for me.Cities and places around Italy were mentioned.. Florence, Milan, Capri, Lake Como, La Scala, the Galleria, the Duomo. I have been to all these places several times and was excited to read about them.. but there wasn't that much info about them. (felt like it was just name droppin)As far as story lines and characters, I felt like there were just too many with way too much unnecessary information. There was also an excessive amount of twists and turns trying to make it more interesting... but sometimes less is more.When everyone's secrets were finally revealed, they didn't exactly pack the punch I was waiting for.No tears and no big gasps from me.Maybe if the characters had reacted with more emotion after learning certain, pretty big secrets.. it would have drawn out more emotion from me. It was kind of like, "oh really? you killed my best friend, ok, no biggy, I can get passed it!" WHAT?? That is NOT a quote by any means.. just giving an example!I did enjoy the his and hers pov.The ending was supposed to be a HEA but felt like a HFN. Alek's words at the end of the Epilogue had me feeling like he was more unsure at the end than he was at the beginning. I guess it was just a little anticipation for the next book in the series.*I received a copy from NetGalley in exchange for an honest review .
I have a headache from crying so much! I pretty much cried thru this entire book!Present Perfect is a best friends turned lovers type story, told in Amanda's pov. It's the journey of their lives and friendship from childhood to adulthood. They struggle most of the way trying to stay best friends, even though loving one another so much more than just friends.The story begins so sweet, innocent and beautiful. It certainly has it's funny moments as well.Along the way Amanda sticks with the "just friends" rule which got so frustrating! The angst was driving me so crazy that I seriously thought about not continuing to read!I loved Noah though and wanted them to desperately get together, so I continued!I cried here and there throughout the first half, but come 70% in and the damn broke!I don't think I stopped crying from that point on until the end of the epilogue!I was a mess when it said THE END! Thank you Jesus for the epilogue!Amanda and Noah's story was cute, sweet, funny, frustrating, infuriating, sad, terribly sad, and loaded with angst .
3.5 stars *I received an arc in exchange for an honest review*This is the story of Kayla and her struggle with anorexia and bulemia. Kayla struggles with her feelings over her father's recent death and the pressures from her conceited mother who is constantly putting her down.The author takes you on an emotional journey with Kayla's self destructive behavior. Along the way she has family, friends and her boyfriend Cameron who love and try to help her.. but it's of no use.The story and characters were very realistic and I was moved by the overall message of the book.I was very happy with Cameron. I adored how he stood up to Kayla's mother and how he didn't shy away from Kayla's problems.I felt empathy for Kayla, having struggled with my weight for many years. I have tried some of the same tricks. I know about the chewing gum, green tea and laxatives. Fortunately for me, I had never gone to the extremes that Kayla did. When Kayla turned to Pro-Ana for help, it just made my stomach churn.There were a few funny moments, some different struggles, love, and an awesome message.. but in my opinion it was more of an "after school special" type book, rather than a romance novel .
This was a lighthearted romance about loss, love and second chances.  If you're into the fairytale, never ending sweetness and happy endings then you'll enjoy this easy read. If you're looking for a gritty tear jerker with substance then this isn't it.Don't get me wrong, I did enjoy the story. I do believe in fate and that's what this story is about.After losing her husband Carson, Korrine meets up with her old college flame Galen and they pick right back up where they left off.Unfortunately I was left with unanswered questions, mixed feelings and a need for more of an emotional connection. It was all too sweet and perfect and also slightly predictable.I did like Galen's character. He was sweet, protective, nurturing and damn romantic. I also enjoyed their steamy scenes... although the "car moment" just didn't make sense knowing Korrine's aversion to car accidents and safety! I also think there should have been more on Galen and Korrine's initial break up. They were so in love and so perfect for each other yet they broke up because of a couple hours drive? Um ok.*I received an Arc provided by NetGalley  in exchange for an honest review .
*I was given an arc in exchange for an honest review*Unexpected could have been a great story, I just know it. Unfortunately for me, it was not.The story is based around the tragic day 9/11, and how the lives of the characters, Michelle and Connor, were forever changed.I remember where I was on 9/11. Everyone does. I was immediately captivated from the beginning of the story. Reading Faith's words about that tragic day and seeing it thru Michelle's eyes stirred up some deep feelings. She was traumatized and afraid and you could feel it.I was very excited to continue reading.. but that's when things kind of went south.Shortly after is when you meet Connor and the story evolves. He meets Michelle, wants to offer her a job, show her NY isn't that bad and wants to help her get over her fears.This is where it got strange for me and it continued to feel that way til the end.It seemed as though several details had been skipped over throughout the story.One moment they just met and the next she is talking about how he is giving mixed signals, first he's hot, then he's cold. ?? When? Did I miss something?I felt like I was missing parts of the story. It needed a little more detail, especially about Connor and Michelle's feelings. If they had an instant chemistry, I didn't feel it, or read about it!The book was a quick read but it just felt flat. Some of it didn't really make sense.I honestly believe it had the potential to be great, but most of it just felt a little blah.I feel the writing in the beginning was beautifully done, but it wasn't powerful enough to bring me to tears .
I don't like giving books a negative review, but there was just something about it and I couldn't quite get into it.I was intrigued, an Italian girl falls in love with her childhood American friend... I love Rome and Italy in general! (I'm from Naples) Arancini and mozzarella di bufala! yumBut there was just something off in the story for me. It didn't flow well, how it went back and forth thru past and present. I didn't quite care for Brina either. :(She was very fragile and emotional.. and I didn't get the not eating. Was it because of her emotional state?Also, I'm not opposed to lots of sex and steamy scenes in books.. I love it.. but there was just too much I thought. I myself can't believe I said that!The premise of the story, not being able to live/breathe without the one you love by your side is beautiful... but this book just wasn't for me.*I received an arc in exchange for an honest review .
Mmm whisker burn from Dagger.... I'll take it!!Fall For Me wasn't your typical hardcore bad boy rock star romance.You don't get drugs, alcohol, naked groupie sex parties, etc.Yes, Dagger Drummond is a mega rock star with adoring groupies and infamous one night stands.. but you don't really get all of that. That's not what this story is about.Fall For Me is a sweet love story about finding yourself, being who you were meant to be and who you were meant to be with!That doesn't mean there wasn't some hot and steamy sexy goodness going on, because there was!! Phone sex, limo sex, kitchen sex...whisker burn!! Haha It was all hot!!I really enjoyed the way Dagger pursued Ryan in a not so aggressive way. He was flirting with him but at the same time respected Ryan's needs and concerns.I also appreciate how Ryan wanted to explore his feelings, yet at the same time didn't jump right into bed like I find happens in some other GFY books.Both men were caring and sensitive.. but sometimes too sensitive? I only have a couple of negatives and that one I&#8217;m on the fence about. Even fellow rocker Zander seemed quite nice and sweet.Maybe I&#8217;m just used to rockers being jerks!?Another negative was the editing. I noticed a few mistakes here and there, but they didn&#8217;t take away from the story any.And lastly, honestly I think the last chapter was unnecessary. The story could have ended with chapter 18 and I would have been perfectly content.Recap- hot and steamy, sweet and loving. This was my first Ann Lister book and I look forward to reading more from her .
What a beautiful companion to Collide. Gail McHugh has done it again!This was both unbelievably beautiful and unbelievably heart breaking! I didn't think I could fall for Gavin any more than I already had in Collide, but I was wrong!You'll cry tears of joy and tears of sorrow! Amazing .
*I received an arc in exchange for an honest reviewSara is obsessed, almost stalkerish, with a rock star named Tyler Vincent... in walks Dale Diamond who is a carbon copy of said rock star!In the beginning, Dale was adorable with the skittles! Later on he showed his protective and possessive nature. Ugh I love that! I could feel their chemistry. The sex scenes were steamy!Am not sure how I feel about Sara's obsession with Tyler though and Dale being ok with it. :(Parts were, dare I say, predictable? I had Dale figured out in the beginning. Sara's secrets, on the other hand were a bit of a shocker.Lots of dramatic moments, shockers and secrets revealed towards the end. It seemed a little much all at once.Regardless, I enjoyed this quick read. It had love, steam, sadness and a happy ending .
Mikayla has everything an 18 year old girl could ever want, until one horrible night takes it all away from her.This was a sweet, funny, emotional and loving story.There were unexpected twists throughout, even up to the end! There was angst and steaminess! Jake is swoon worthy and my new book boyfriend! I also loved Jake's group of friends.Can't wait to read about Logan in book number two .
There were quite a few things about this book that I liked, and others that I didn't so much.Georgia leaves her longtime boyfriend Kyle back home in DC to fix up a beach house on the North Carolina coast she recently purchased. She enlists the help of her two best friends Drew and Silas.Cue Tristan!! Hot, sexy, man whore and down right delicious!!(Tristan is friends with Gavin, Drew's boyfriend)There wasn't too much about Georgia's dreaded past, at least for the first 75% of the book, besides a nightmare or two. Other than that, I don't see how it affected her life. To me she just seemed indecisive, and scared.She was caught between falling for Tristan and her feeling of debt/familiarity with Kyle. Some angst there because she kept going back and forth! Poor Tristan! I felt for him, not her.Also Georgia needed to "find herself", the synospis said? Did she do that? I missed that part."Poison and Wine" by the Civil Wars is Awesome! It was the song playing in the car when Tristan and Georgia were out together.. and also he hummed it to her one night! Loved it!I also loved the reading scenes on the beach!!! Very sweet and romantic.All in all, I liked it, but not sure if I need to read the sequel. Although it ended a tad abruptly for me.. I liked how things worked out in the end .
OK, the very beginning had me captivated and intrigued.First of all Brandon!! UGH, I wanted to beat Brandon's ass myself!Then, the thought of young love...he leaves for the Marines..she stays behind!!!! ooohhh its getting better and better!But then I got a little bored and actually annoyed.Izzy was all over the place!The use of Fu#% was too excessive. I like to use it, read it, say it...but it felt at times like it was thrown in there just to be in there...like there was a Fu#%ing quota to reach!"Merry Fu#%ing Christmas"? ? :( that was a little too much*slight spoilerAll of these big, tough, protective as hell bodyguards are all in her house and they let her, the damsel in distress who needs protecting, be the one to open the front door?? Then, nobody goes to check on her for what?? 10 minutes??About 60% into it, it got a little better for me, like when they got together and actually talked about the past! But I don't get how you can see someone you thought was dead, whom you never stopped loving, and you ignore them and are completely pissed at them!I liked the ending... after the journey they had, they deserved it.I think Axel is hot, yes, but it wasn't the great book I was expecting it to be .
Let me start by saying that I LOVE a forbidden teacher/student romance!!Cadence was good. She's a loving daughter, sister and friend. She's innocent and naive. She attends church, youth group and believes in God. (this book does not preach to you, but religion/God is heavily referenced throughout the book)Then one day, one bad decision was all it took to turn her into a very bad girl.After returning from Juvie, she is ostracized. Her parents have taken every liberty from her, as well as their trust, respect and in some ways, their love. Her friends are no longer speaking to her. Her fellow classmates tease and taunt her.The only shining light is her teacher, Mark Connelly.The age difference!!When they met, she was a couple months shy of 18. Meaning, still 17 and he was 28. Is that wrong? I'm not sure how I feel. My husband and I are 6 years apart and I was 17 when we started dating. I'm on the fence about the age difference.This book elicited many emotions from me. From the beginning, I felt so sorry for Cadence. She was so sad and alone. I can't imagine having to go thru all the terrible pranks and harsh words from her fellow classmates.At the same time, it was pretty darn funny. Most of the time it was Cadence's thinking that was pretty sarcastic, not to mention her friend Avery that had me laughing out loud.Avery was just plain hilarious!Then comes Mark Connelly.At times he seemed so young and cool. I forgot how old he was and everything was sweet and romantic. Then something would happen or in something he would say, made me cringe and think OMG he is an almost 30 year old man!!My emotions were changing from page to page. Their relationship is fine, sweet, innocent. Then the next page it felt wrong and dirty.There are also moments that make you angry. At one point I was pissed and completely shocked! I couldn't believe the things that I was reading.The ending left me wanting more. It seemed to abruptly just end! What happens now?? I need to know more.Also, Mark was quite a mystery. There really wasn't much information or details about him and his life before Cadence. I know he's hiding secrets and I want to find out what they are .
Where to start?? UGH, SO many times was my heart broken throughout this series.This was not only the end, but also a wonderful recap of Olivia and Caleb's journey, told thru Caleb's pov.I was shattered each and every time one of them chose to walk away from each other. So many mistakes and so much lost time.The moments in the present with Estella were just gut-wrenching to read.Olivia drove me crazy with how she kept letting Caleb go!But, I couldn't stop crying for Olivia towards the end. (don't want to give away any spoilers, you need to read it yourself)) I could say that it was Karma.. but that would make me not a nice person.Leah is awful and I hate her!Caleb's love for Olivia never faultered. I loved seeing things thru his eyes and reading about the little moments they shared. The llama name calling was hilarious and him replacing her dying plants were just so sweet and beautiful!I LOVE Caleb and this was a beautiful ending to their story!!great guote- "We are all so broken. Pick up a person, shake them around and you'll hear the rattling of their broken pieces .
WOW!!Blind Obsession is a beautifully written book. Have your tissues ready as well as a clean pair of panties!What an incredible, tortured and tragic love story... but it was more than that. Intense, erotic and voyeuristic... as well as devastating and utterly heartbreaking.I know I can not do it justice with words.This book is also a total mind fu%@! One minute you're intrigued and awed, the next you're completely shocked!At times I cried so hard and even got chills!It was so erotic and sexy as well as passionate, tender and loving.Blind Obsession is one hell of a rollercoaster ride!!! I didn't want it to end!Sadly it had to end and not the way I wanted it to. Of course, I cried again!Definite must read. Bravo Ella Frank .
It starts off with Mason at 18, (his pov) being "propositioned" by his landlady in order to avoid eviction. Awesome! Sounds great so far!Two years later, the story goes into Reese, (her pov from now on) who moved across the country to escape her psycho ex-boyfriend.Reese happens to spot hottie Mason from across her new college campus....commence drooling now....sparks begin to fly.. then she finds out he's a gigolo!The story is really cute and funny. The entire story from start to finish is pretty funny. It's mostly Reese and her sense of humor that had me laughing.It's a little sad as well. Mason does what he does for his family, not because he enjoys it. His younger sister Sarah has Cerebral Palsy and is confined to a wheelchair. He needs the money to not only pay for his college, but his sister's and mother's bills.There's also a hint of the unknown/of danger lurking... with Reese's ex on the loose and possibly after her.Throughout there's sweet and sexy banter between Reese and Mason, as they attempt a friendship while trying to avoid their attraction and the fact that he is in fact a gigolo.You also see a sweet and loving Mason with his sister Sarah.The reason for the 3 stars only is because towards the end, it got a little cheesy maybe? The story throughout seemed to flow just fine, drama, romance, build up... then it seemed like everything happened all at once. Like, race to the finish, go out with a bang!The cousin, the ex, the landlady... rolled up with a HEA and what you hoped would happen of course, but it just kind of seemed a little far fetched and like I said, cheesy. Still, it was a cute and enjoyable story .
SO not what I was expecting!I laughed and I cried, and then cried again and again and again!!This was such a sweet, sad and inspirational story. It was also pretty darn funny!I loved all the witty banter between everyone. I laughed out loud quite a few times.I want to read more about Gabe too! YummySpeaking of yummy... Wes!! Hot, smart, funny, charming, did I say hot? Wes was so grounded and wise for someone in his predicament. Also, there were some very enlightening words of wisdom.I thought there would be more about Kiersten. Maybe a little darker of a story/past, but there wasn't anything too dramatic about her.I found the story to be very.... clean/pure I guess I would say. Not much cursing if any at all and no sex. Also some "divine" moments... and luckily NO cliffhanger!Great story and I loved it .
Ok, I'm finally finished crying and can formulate a sentence!!!A Dark Road was recommended to me by a friend. The synopsis sounded intriguing.. but led me to believe this would be a bit of a darker read. James McKay is a drug dealer! Mystery, secrets, overdose, meth making... but it wasn't.The story was rather sweet, easy going, and funny.At times though, I found it a little slow. Other times, there was a lot of rambling.. very descriptive.. about meth making!! How to make it, what meds to buy, what the chemicals do to your body, how to counteract the reactions and side effects.Throughout I was enjoying the light read, very YA, even with the meth. I kept thinking, Ok.. this is cute and it's sweet, but nothing WOW, how was I going to rate it? Then I got to the end and BOOM!!! The ending. WTF??? Are you serious?? I cried and cried! I was shocked!I enjoyed the closeness of the twins Hadley and Simon.Hadley was funny and sarcastic. The interactions with "Dog" were very sweet and loving.I felt bad for James. He'd been making meth since he was 14 and figured staying away from people and friends was the best way to not let on about his meth making. In doing so, he's alienated himself from everybody. He was lonely.I'm not happy with how it ended, so I can't say that I loved the book. Like I said, it was a light easy going read until the end and then I was way too distraught by the shock .
3.5 starsSo this book started out real cute and funny. Enter hot bad boy on a motorcycle and things get pretty steamy and raunchy. (both of which I like)Unfortunately, I got a little bored wanting something exciting to happen and actually put the book down for a day or so.What did I know, right?Well, I picked it back up and when I got to 45% in ....HOLY CRAP, I was so not expecting all that crazy drama to happen! Boy did things take a turn for the worse making me cringe more than once!Brace yourself because the punches keep on coming until about 70% of the way thru!This story is like eating one of Ana's pies!Your first bite is sweet and delicious... mm mm you can't wait to dig in! The next couple of bites are just as tasty. Halfway through you feel sick to your stomach, slightly disgusted and don't think you can handle anymore.. yet you press on. Once you've devoured the very last bite you push back from the table with just enough energy to rub your satisfied belly and smile!Fortunately if you like happy endings.. this one ends the way it starts.. funny, steamy and raunchy .
2.5 starsLogan is a car thief. A very hot car thief! He meets Maddie under rather odd circumstances and they have an instant connection. They have a hot chemistry as well.... meaning the sex is HAWT!! Thank goodness.. because that's pretty much what kept me reading.The storyline was different and intriguing. I really enjoyed the beginning, but then later it was just alright.Bad boy meets good girl, they share a troubled past thanks to their parents, he doesn't want to fall for her but he does, she's head over heels for him, yada yada yada happy ever after.It wasn't a bad story, it was just cheesy at times. Some of the dialogue was childish. Maddie was wishy washy, but could get over anything with just a smile from Logan! blahLike I said, I was happy about the steamy scenes cause those were the best parts .
Loved it! Lili and Chase's story was beautiful.This story had me laughing, swooning, laughing again and crying! Not necessarily tissue after tissue, but definitely tear worthy."raw and explosive one minute, to tender and loving the next"That is a very fitting description taken right from the story itself!Lili is a sweet, beautiful girl living a ho hum life. She is "sleep running" as she calls it. She suffered a great tragedy and is now simply existing, rather than living... that is until the day she meets Dr. Chase Colton.And Dr. Chase Colton aka Dr. Sexy, Dr. Possessive, Dr. Intensity, Dr. Compassionate, Dr. Orgasm... is one hot ass alpha male surgeon! mm mm mmChase is also holding back from really living. He harbors great guilt for his past mistakes and there was absolutely nothing anybody could do to change him ..... until Lili came along.Another reviewer mentioned Grey's Anatomy. It's true! You do get a Grey's Anatomy/ER feel, especially in the beginning.Loved...Chase is very possessive and protective.. and SO HOT!There are several supporting characters, friends and family whom all added great humor and drama.Sierra's pregnancy woes had me rolling on the floor laughing!!Chase's family secrets and pain caused me just that, pain. How utterly heart-breaking! And the Epilogue!!! HOLY CRAP, this is where I did most of the crying!!!Not so much love...Some of it was a little repetitive. Asspuck! Ok, that was funny.. but it was the only word they used, over and over!Also the use of "truth". The first couple of times it was sweet, then after the 50th "truth" all I could see was The Kardashians saying Bible!Speaking of all things Kardashian.. Guy sure liked using the term "Doll"!! (but that I liked)And finally.... Blue! I can't get over the nickname. I get it, it's her eyes.. yes, yes, sweet.. but really? All I kept thinking was BLUE 32, BLUE 32, HUT HUT!!SO... repetitive words aside.... and really, what's a couple of words?? .... I did really love this!!Great job ladies! I am looking forward to reading Beautifully Done in 2014 .
Amazing job Leah Raeder!!I received an arc in exchange for an honest review...Honestly, I loved it! :)It was funny, sarcastic, witty, forbidden, naughty, steamy, sad, and sweet!! Also had a couple Holy CRAP moments I wasn't expecting.The synopsis says it all.. teacher-student romance.. no need for me to say more, except READ THIS BOOK .
2.5 starsI was so excited to read Carter Reed!! 5 stars all over the place!! Raving recommendations!! Ooooohhhh aaaaaahhhhhh What?? Where?? Did I read the same book??Wasn't sure if I could put into words how I felt about this book. I actually was going to stop reading a couple of times, but I actually managed to finish it.It's not that I hated it, but it was just ho hum for me.The sex wasn't that steamy. The action was dull. Emma was a touch annoying. Teresa was quite annoying and the whole Teresa and Noah thing?? We just getting buttered up for their book?? That's what it felt like.From the very beginning I wasn't happy. The synopsis already tells you that she walks in on her roommate being raped by her boyfriend. No spoiler there. BUT, she pretty much watches him rape her. She's cool and calm and SLOW! She takes her sweet ass time!! She let him finish!!!!! I was already turned off by that.I'm giving 2.5 stars because it's got suspense, intrigue, a hot guy with piercing eyes, the damsel in distress but who can actually take care of herself, alpha male, bad boy, blah blah blah...but overall it just didn't blow me away like I was desperately wanting it to .
5 incredible starsWOW! That was quite possibly one of the most emotional and inspirational books that I have ever read! Such powerful words! Beautifully written! Well done Amy Harmon!I found myself highlighting so many passages that really struck me, but I can't possibly share them all or I'd be quoting the entire book!Making Faces is so much more than the story of the ugly duckling Fern who falls in love with the Herculean Ambrose! Making Faces tells many stories about friendship, family, love, loss, tragedy and triumph. It's about BAILEY! Bailey, Fern's cousin is the other piece to this story. Bailey and Fern's relationship and bond had me laughing out loud one moment and crying my eyes out the very next.Who am I kidding? I cried for most of the book!!I can't explain the emotions this book brought out in me or the lessons I have learned. What I can tell you is this is a MUST READ!!"If God made all our faces, did he laugh when he made me?""was he a pet?""no, we just met .
This story is not only sweet and sexy but also at times a little sad.Both Noah and Cooper have painful memories they'd rather forget.They were best friends as young boys, confiding in each other things they never told another soul.Now 17 years later they've reconnected again, picking right back up where they left off. Only this time there's a little more than just friendship going on.I love the possessiveness and jealousy they both felt."You touch me again, and you won't have a choice. You'll me mine."There's also some purty hot moments!!-Coop watched as Noah's chest and stomach heaved in and out with laughter. Eyed the bar piercing through his nipples. And Jesus... wondered how they would feel against his tongue. What it would be like to run his hand over Noah's firm muscles.-But for some reason the use of the word "man" just felt weird to me. I know men use it all the time, like the words "buddy" or "dude", and that's all fine and dandy most of the time, but during sex or foreplay? It just felt out of place.I really enjoyed this GFY/friends turned lovers story and can't wait for Riley Hart's next book .
4.5 hot sexy stars&#34;Tate's cock pointed proudly toward its owner. There was no need for it to worry. Logan knew exactly who it belonged to&#34;I LOVE Ella Frank and was so damn excited when she announced her first M/M book!!!Logan is arrogant, confident, gorgeous and pretty much sex on legs!&#34;I like to try a little bit of everything and everyone..... I'd like to try you.&#34;Tate is beautiful, sexy and straight!Tate uses his charm to flirt with both women and men in order to garner larger tips at his bartending job. Flirting with men has never been a problem until he met Logan Mitchell.Try is an extremely steamy book filled with forbidden desire, lust, explosive chemistry and hot hot hot sex!I really liked how both Logan and Tate are confident, strong, manly men who also display moments of tenderness, vulnerability and need.I enjoyed the possessiveness they both felt towards each other but was missing a little more intimacy and love. It was getting there towards the end, but I wanted more.Don't get me wrong.. I'm glad this wasn't an insta-love story, but I felt like there needed to be deeper emotions.After the hurt that was caused, the forgiveness happened too easily. If it had been a woman, she'd have been pissed for days! Maybe weeks!! They kissed and made up too quickly. And holy hotness did they kiss and make up!!!Maybe I was just expecting a little more heart-breaking angst and possibly a tear or two like Ella's other books??Regardless, I very much enjoyed reading Try. Great M/M read, hot men and lots of steamy goodness!I can't wait to see how their relationship progresses in Take! Summer 2014? Ugh, I don't want to wait that long .
2.5 but not quite 3 starsMMA hottie?? Tattoos?? Say no more, I'm there!!Unfortunately, I didn't get what I was looking for.SO.... although I heard this was very similar to Beautiful Disaster, I kept an open mind and tried not to think about it too much.Honestly, the similarities weren't many.MMA fighter/ total player attracted to quiet girl, he agrees to be &#34;just friends&#34;, eventually they hook up! Oh and instead of him getting her a puppy, he finds kittens! Ok, so there's a few things.. but it ends there, trust me! It might sound like BD, but it sure as hell wasn't!I am a little bummed though, because there was potential for an awesome read, but it didn't quite grip me like I wanted it to. Some parts were actually good, but the rest was just ok for me.It was there... two troubled main characters, one a hot tatted fighter, hidden secrets and pasts on both parts, mysterious exes, sexy time.... but it didn't really come together.Lorrie wasn't intriguing enough for me. I could take or leave her. There was also too much dialogue with Lorrie's aunt which just didn't do anything for the story, and way too much emphasis on the damn kittens...Yes yes, cute little kitties... but Hunter was a big bad womanizing fighter for all of two seconds, then suddenly turns to mush over kittens??Ok, lets talk about something else... sex! So about 65ish% in, the sex comes into play and that's when I had to laugh! OMG, first of all, they go from not even flirting a little bit to downright marathon f***ing! Dirty talk and everything!!Then comes the breakfast!!bahahaha They had breakfast while doing the nasty!!! Seriously, she was eating toast and eggs while he was taking her from behind!??? I don't think it was supposed to be funny, but damn was I laughing!Oh, and did I mention it's a CLIFFHANGER??Yep, the end leaves you hanging and what's funny is although I wasn't 100% into the book, I want to know what happens with Hunter!! Lorrie not so much. She just didn't really do anything for me.*I received an ARC from NetGalley in exchange for an honest review .
3.5 starsVinny is definitely all grown up now!! No longer the boy we met in Worth the Fight, he's now a strong, sexy, alpha male with dimples and tats!Vinny and Olivia met in high school. This story has moments from the past told in both his and her pov, which I rather enjoyed.As far as the present goes, there's quite a lot going on. At first I really liked Liv, but as the story progressed, her actions bothered me a bit.Now, Vinny... he is hot and sexy! He also knows how to &#34;take care&#34; of his woman. I'm cringing saying this and also saying it very quickly hoping you're not paying attention.. but maybe a little too much sex and I sort of skimmed thru some of the sex to get to what happens next!I liked it, but didn't love it as much as Worth the Fight. Where Nico and Elle's story was funny, sexy and sweet... Vinny and Liv's story is more drama with lots of sex of course.I'm a little torn on how I feel. My expectations may have just been too high and it just didn't completely blow me away.Still enjoyed the read, was happy to have more Nico and Elle and will definitely read Jax's story next .
Ok, Belle Aurora, you got me again!!I was very excited to read Raw, hearing how different, gritty, emotional, disturbing and just how amazing it was.Unfortunately about 19% into it I gave up!! I just couldn't handle Lexi. What was she thinking?? To quote directly from the story...&#34;This whole situation...it's f***ing ridiculous!&#34;BUT.. I was persuaded by friends to continue.. so I did.Let me start from the beginning...It immediately got my attention and interest. It started of sweet and incredibly sad, then it turned into a mix of crazy stalking and crazy erotic moments between a brooding, twisted a-hole and a naive innocent goofball!I still didn&#8217;t understand all the hype, nor did I like Lexi. I have to say though, I was intrigued enough by Twitch to read on.UGH but the name Twitch just drove me crazy. I mean, Twitch?The story greatly improved once their relationship evolved. I found myself laughing at Lexi's internal dialogue and at the silly things she did. I also enjoyed the addition of Lexi's friends Nikki and Dave to include Happy.The story continued to be a little shady, disturbing, sexy, funny and then we got a mixture of sweetness and a shock of sadness I wasn't expecting.Yes, I cried! Not once, but twice!!In the end, it wasn't the happily ever after fairy tale a lot of us saps want... but things happened the way I pretty much expect them to end.Overall I can say that I'm glad I continued on and finished the book. Although it was a rough start, it got much better and I rather enjoyed it .
-&#34;the loudest words are the ones we live.&#34;What a beautiful story!!! I absolutely LOVED Archer!!!!Beautiful, compassionate, tender, inspiring, funny, sexy... that not only describes Archer's Voice, but Archer Hale himself!My words can't do it justice, it's a MUST READ! Definitely my favorite from Mia Sheridan!-&#34;I lost my heart to you. And, Bree, in case you're wondering, I don't ever want it back.&#34 .
LOVED LOVED LOVED!!!Heartwarming, hilarious and simply amazing!I laughed so loud and so often, but also cried and cried!!This story is told in the pov of Ehd, a caveman. A CAVEMAN!Think about what life was like back then, what their sole purpose in life was. He is man, protector, hunter, he finds a mate, makes babies, then protects and hunts for them. Done!Ehd made my laugh and cry. His antics are hilarious!He can't speak, nor does he understand what speaking is. To him it's just noise... which gives him a head ache!He's brave and strong, yet sensitive, sweet and unassuming.&#34;She may be strange; she may not know how to make baskets, and she may be very noisy, but she is my mate, and I am thrilled she is here.&#34;Transcendence is unlike anything I have ever read and I loved it. I couldn't put it down and am unlikely to forget about Ehd and Beh anytime soon. This is one of those books that will stay with me for a very long time .
-&#34;Maybe most things, the important things, don't really have to make sense. Maybe they just are.&#34;Truly amazing read! I went thru an array of emotions while reading this that it was overwhelming. I cried and I hurt, over and over.There was such sweetness, passion, love, pain and beauty!Fantastic job Riley Hart!-&#34;Emotions don't play by rules. That's what makes them so incredible.&#34;Let me say that I sometimes find it hard to read menage books. When it's happening for fun, it's fine, I get it... but when it comes to matters of the heart, it makes me feel weird. I don't know, like it's cheating. This book made me feel that at one point as well as confused. I didn't understand what was happening, I was sad and angry....but then I got it. I figured it out. It all made sense.-&#34;Nothing in this world was completely black and white. Right or wrong.&#34;-&#34;We might be broken in so many ways, but together, we're whole.&#34;Broken Pieces really surprised me. It wasn't what I was expecting and it was awesome .
Heed the warning!! Must have full box of tissues before reading this book!Beth Rinyu never lets me down. I heard she had a new book coming out, synopsis be damned, I added it to my tbr list!I don't care what it's about. Beth could write about Honey Boo Boo buying a new dress and I would buy it, read it, love it and cry my eyes out!!!Imagine my luck, winning a copy!!! I was over the moon!-"I had everything that I ever wanted... a beautiful child, a great husband, and a perfect home. Now I had nothing. My heart, my soul, and the reason that I breathed, my Charlie, was gone."Oh My Gawd did I cry!! This is a beautifully written emotional journey of overcoming tragedy, finding solace in unexpected places and learning to celebrate life. Yes it is emotional and heart-wrenching, but there is also love, friendship and laughter. Oh and lets not forget the steam!I loved each and every character and what they brought to the story as well as the different relationships throughout. The love between a parent and child, husband and wife, and between best friends. The writing is so believable and relateable that you can't help but become attached and emotionally invested in the characters.-"Happiness is the most important thing in the world. Life is too short to live without it."I want you to go in blindly like I did, so I won't say more than I need to. Read this book .
Two girls. One Leo. This sounded like it was going to be a rip your heart out with a spoon angst filled throw down!! Thankfully for me it was not!Instead it was a lighthearted, funny, sweet, and sexy romance. Two actually.(twins, remember?)Speaking of sexy...I loved Leo!!!!&#34;Hello, Mr Hottie-Boom-Body.&#34;Clara and Maggie's story is told in alternating povs. I really liked it that way and like I said earlier, it sort of feels like two stories weaving each other into one!I absolutely fell for Clara! She is the &#34;bad&#34; sister, if you will... but looks can be deceiving!&#34;Her side will be the irrational, moronic side and secretly you'll agree with me, but I'll be the bigger person and forgive you in  advance for siding with her.&#34;There are a handful of characters in this story, but neither taking away from the other. Not to give any spoilers away, but I feel like we needed a little more info on the &#34;bartender&#34;. We got his story, yes, but I was left feeling like I needed a little more. That part of the story, to me felt like second place to the other relationship going on.There were some great moments, funny, tender and yes, some a little steamy! I even laughed out loud quite a few times!&#34;Did she murder a Care Bear and make it into a hat?&#34;Awesome debut novel Sarah! I look forward to reading more books from you in the future!*I received an ARC in exchange for an honest review .
I can't even put into words how much this book moved me, so I won't muck it up trying. What I can say is, Reclaiming the Sand will take you for a ride. A back and forth, up and down gut wrenching emotional roller coaster of a ride!As per the blurb, yes, at times I hated Ellie with a passion as I did her friends. I just wanted to throttle them! But then there were moments when I understood her and felt for her.Flynn on the other hand... I LOVED!I cried for Flynn for days. Each and every pov from Flynn broke my heart to pieces. It's taken me days to write this review, just because of Flynn's words.&#34;I was alone.I was always alone.I don't have friends.I don't talk to anyone.&#34;This is an absolutely beautiful story of two misunderstood souls that will break your heart. I loved it!! MUST READ .
I LOVED it!This was such a sweet and heartfelt story about love, loss and second chances. A very well rounded story, from emotional and melancholy to light and funny.&#34;...there comes a time when you need to be yourself again. A time when what was or what could have been has to be put away for what can be...&#34;It has to be devastating losing the one you love and somehow still finding the will to move on... but Brett was doing the exact opposite. He couldn't move on, couldn't let go. My heart broke for him.&#34;Hello Darlin'....&#34;K-lee Klein did an amazing job. I felt Brett's pain as if it were my own. I had tears in my eyes so many times!I also laughed a lot. I absolutely loved each of the characters and their good ole' Southern ways! Lots of Southern-isms that had me laughing throughout.&#34;happier than a pig in sh**&#34;I also appreciated how although we got a nice dose of steam, it was very realistic. The main characters didn't just jump right in to bed, broken heart be damned! This was a very real and believable love story. They took their time with their feelings and it was beautiful .
So I'm on the fence. I didn't love it, but I did like it.Some parts I rather enjoyed, others were merely ok and some I actually skimmed thru! :(Ty and Zane are forced to go on leave, which they take together visiting Ty's family in West Virginia.There's action, suspense, tenderness and a couple.. meaning two.. sexy scenes. (I wanted more)Getting to know a bit of where Ty comes from and why he is the way he is was great. I love the way his family interacts with each other, their playfulness and their tough as nails attitude.I found myself doing some skimming here and there and was getting a little perturbed with the fact these guys wouldn't open up to each other.I mean, I love that they are both rough and tough hard asses not wearing their emotions on their sleeves, but I was waiting for more from them!!Then finally at the end, I finally got what I wanted!! :) Thank you for that.I LOVE Ty and Zane. Their banter, the jokes and their protectiveness of each other.I also got my &#34;baby&#34; fix.. but just once, like in Cut & Run. There's just something about a big tough guy calling his lover &#34;baby&#34;. mmm mmm yumHeading right to my Kindle to read Fish & Chips .
3 starsThe sex was really steamy and hot!! I mean H O T! Love me some man on man action and firemen to boot! YUM! The kissing at the firehouse had me melting.. as did Griff watching Dante on his laptop! droolBut, I am SO not into redheads!! haha I tried to not picture him too pale and red, but that was the big appeal to him in the story. Over and over I read pale, cinnamon, pale, rusty, pale, ginger, pale!!! aaahhh But of course, that's my personal opinion.That's not why I didn't love it though. The beginning was a little slow for me. Also, once they became lovers it seemed like they both completely changed over night. There was no romance or dating period it seemed.. they just went right to a solid couple with one turning into a jealous as hell possesive partner. I know they had been friends forever and didn't need the "getting to know you" stage, but if the author hadn't waited until the very end to get them to share their feelings, then maybe we'd have had a little more romance and sweetness. That's what I feel was missing .
WOW!! I can't stop the tears.Flawed is a gripping tale of fear, love and tragedy. It's truly a heartbreaking read and at times quite disturbing.From the very beginning I had a terrible feeling of how things would end, but I pushed it out of my mind. I was SO expecting and hoping for a different outcome.Flawed is dark and twisted. You'll never listen to &#34;You are my Sunshine&#34; the same way again! It will have you cringing and crying.It's definitely a must read .
3.5 starsCollege Boys was a short, sweet story about finding love and finding yourself.Chris and Peter previously met on a camping trip where they had shared a tent. Ever since that night.. neither had been able to stop thinking of the other. Unfortunately for both, Chris is straight and Peter is gay. After the death of his mother, Chris decided to move out of his shared room with fellow soccer mates and opts for a single across campus. As luck would have it, Peter turns out to be his dorm room neighbor. And wouldn't you know it, but the rooms used to once be a double and are now essentially only being separated by a flimsy wall. A wall you can hear everything thru!Their relationship evolves into a sweet friendship, but all their interactions happen thru the wall! They listen to music, talk and evetually one night things go to the next level.. . And it gets H O T!!The story touches briefly on homophobia and bullying. But I didn't find it to be an overwhelming message in the story.What was most dominant was Chris and his struggle to find out who he was and how to make sense of his new feelings.Peter was very sweet and patient even though he was confident in himself and that what he wanted was for him and Chris to be together.The ending was nice and all, but the marriage talk was a little shocking. I mean, Chris just "came out" and Peter is his first!But, there is such a thing as love at first sight. I guess when you know, you know!Sweet, loving, enjoyable quick read.. with some yummy steaminess invloved!*copy provided by Netgalley for review .
Everyone deserves a second chance, whether it be at love, forgiveness, happiness, friendship, family, or just a happy life. This book has it all and I loved it!A quick read that's funny, sweet and terribly sad! I couldn't put it down.I was not prepared for the emotions brought out in me. Several moments had me crying like a baby!Well written characters, loved the family bond and good ole southern charm!My only complaint would be towards the end. Although the chapters skipped ahead months/years at a time (which was just fine and I liked it), I feel like the ending was rushed a bit. An eighteen month period was skipped  right over which I believe needed more explaining.Regardless, I was left with a HEA and a smile on my face.This was my first T.A. Webb read and can't wait to read more from him .
3.5 starsI LOVE the Cut & Run series, so it was a no-brainer that I&#8217;d be reading this as well.If you take it for what it is, a 100 page novella then you won&#8217;t be disappointed.Several other reviews either haven&#8217;t read the previous Cut and Run books, or were simply expecting something else!Shock & Awe is a spin-off of Cut & Run. This is Nick and Kelly&#8217;s story with a touch of Zane and Ty thrown in for good measure! (thank you Abigail for that!)This is not a full length novel nor is it an in depth look into Nick and Kelly&#8217;s relationship. It is what it is.A handful of days spent between the two where Kelly explores his newfound feelings for his best friend.... and acts on it. And oh how they act on it. Some of it is a little silly and odd, I will admit, but if you&#8217;re a die hard fan, then you&#8217;re happy to have been a part of the moment these two guys come together... pun intended!&#34;No, you don&#8217;t say his name when I f*** you. You say mine.&#34;H O T!!Although Ty and Zane are my favorite, I am not opposed to having a second favorite couple. Am looking forward to more of Nick and Kelly in hopefully a longer book if not several longer books to come .
3.5 starsI am so torn!!! I can't possibly give my beloved Ty and Zane 3 stars, especially since I have been waiting for Ball & Chain for so long.. but then again I feel like 4 stars aren't warranted!!I finally got exactly what I wanted and had been waiting for.. but I felt like I had to go thru a bunch of nonsense to get it. EEK did I just say that? yes.I LOVE Nick and Kelly, but get your own book!!! Ty and Zane are the main course and Nick and Kelly are a side.. didn't feel like it here though. Emotional homecoming which was awesome, but wanted more. Also lots of jokes and funny that I wasn't really feeling.I got some hot sex, still wanted more, and got my happy ending that I desperately needed.. but overall I feel a bit let down .
3.5 starsIt covers an array of "teen struggles", both gay and straight.Fitting in, new kid in school, first crush, pressure to make good grades, bullying, as well as some harsher topics such as obsession, homophobia, gay bashing and abuse.Although this wasn't quite what I was expecting, I did find it to be a very sweet YA story.There were a couple of pretty sad moments and some that shocked the hell out of me.HEA, but think it ended too quickly. I wanted a little more at the end .
I had heard a lot about this series and couldn't wait to read it!I read romance novels that include some mystery or suspense moments.. this was actually a mystery that included some romance in it.Even though it was very different from my norm, I enjoyed it very much!I expected more of a romantic falling in love type story, but got gritty suspense, murder, car chases, explosions and then a side of intrigue, sweetness and lust! Ok... worked for me!!Ty and Zane are both (hot) FBI angents assigned as partners on a serial murder case. They couldn't be more opposite from each other. One's clean cut, polite and by the book while the other is rugged, unpredictable and unrestrained.They had amazing chemistry from bickering partners to forbidden lovers.There were a few HOT moments and also some very sweet and emotional ones as well.- he leaned back against the counter and reached out to slide the ends of his fingers into the front of the waistband of Ty's jeans and tug him forward.mmmm that's when it started!Some readers say the use of &#34;baby&#34; is overused in many books, but I still LOVE it!- &#34;Please....baby,&#34; Zane's voice cracked with agony as he pleaded between uneven gasping breaths. &#34;Get out of the car&#34;UGH you could feel his agony and love!!Can't wait to read the next book .
3.5 starsCorabelle and Gavin were inseparable. They were as close as two people could get. They were each others first kiss, first love, first everything.... until the death of their baby tore them apart.The day Finn died, he took the better of Corabelle and Gavin with him. They were left forever scarred and broken. They tried to move on, fighting to forget, but they never could. They lived separate lives until fate inevitably brought them back together again.I anticipated lots of tears and waited anxiously throughout most of the book for them... but had to wait a while!This was a quick and easy read that I found both sweet and sad. A couple of parts I think were a little long-winded and I kind of sped read thru them.Although an emotional story about love, loss, grief, guilt, etc.. I wasn't getting as emotional as I had wanted.. until about 75% when the flashbacks of what happened with Finn occurred. What an awful experience to have not only as a parent, but a teen parent. Being a mother myself, I can not imagine.It was beautifully written and had me crying my eyes out.The cut out butterflies from Gavin and also the symbolism of the butterfly at the end was beautiful. I definitely believe in that as I do in fate!I enjoyed this story and look forward to the next in this series, Forever Loved!*I received an ARC in exchange for an honest review .
I didn't expect this to be as funny as it was. I mean laugh out loud throughout funny!Besides that there were aspects of the book that were SO sweet and loving along with sexy and steamy as hell!!I'm not usually a fan of "love at first sight" stories.. meaning they meet day one, sleep together and are instantly in love on day two! Well, in Shine Not Burn it works! I loved it!!Besides, you can't beat a hot, strong, hard working family man in a cowboy hat .
3.5 StarsEthan and Beau's story was very sweet and sexy. Ok, most of it was down right HOT.I really loved the camaraderie and family bond between the Walkers. They had a lot to overcome with the homophobia and hate, and they did it with the support of each other.SO, I am one of those that didn't read the others in the Alluring Indulgence series and went and read this one first! In my defense, it states in the synopsis that this could be read as a stand alone!That being said.. I was slightly confused with all the names being thrown at me in the first chapter.. Ethan, Beau, Blake, Zane, Zoey, Travis, Gage, Kylie, V, Sawyer, Kaleb, Brendon, Braydon, Jared, Curtis. Who? What?Of course, as things progressed I got bits and pieces of what was in the other books and who everyone was. It turned out fine.. but if I had to do it over again, I'd probably have read the others first so I had a better understanding of everyone's back story.The same can be said for both Ethan and Beau. Even though we got their stories, and Ethan's is a sad one, I still felt like I was missing something.All is all, I enjoyed reading Ethan. Did I mention it was hot?? It was HOT .
What an emotional read! Not only was Kane and Avery's story sweet, funny and oh so hot.. but it was truly heart-wrenching!! I was completely moved by their love for each other.&#34;he had to touch him, like he had to breathe&#34;Thank you Kindle Alexander, for writing this truly beautiful story about soul mates whose love is never-ending. I cried! I cried big, fat, ugly tears!!!&#34;you stole my heart. Today, I give you my soul. And from this day forward, I vow to never be without you again.&#34 .
2.5 starsThis is by no means a romance novel. It's a silly/funny, dirty sex and insta-love, 50 something page quickie!Freshman Orientation is about a 22 year old college senior who finds he prefers younger men. Not underage mind you, but 18 year old freshman! In fact, he scours the list of incoming freshman the first week of school looking to score! Do people really troll for sex like that?Pretty much Ryan is looking for some random hook ups, nothing more.. until he meets Sean. There's just something about him that makes Ryan want more than his usual one night stand and has him professing his love. Eh, that was a little too sudden.As far as substance, there really isn't any... but for a quick, hot read.. look no further.*Arc provided by NetGalley in exchange for an honest review .
*I received a copy of this book in exchange for a reviewMara's character is very deep. She struggles with her past, her choices, religious beliefs, her lack of love and self worth and major abandonment issues. I felt sorry for her, but was also frustrated by her actions.I didn't know what was going to happen next or how it was going to end/who she would end up with. I really wish James showed a bit more emotion and things would have gone differently, but then it would have been a different story.I was a little worried when it started with the bible/Jesus talk, thought maybe I stumbled upon a Christian book, but it wasn't like that at all. One minute there's talk of Jacob and Jesus and the next she's riding home in a cab with puke in her hair!No bawling or laughing out loud for me, but I do think it was a moving story and I really enjoyed it .
I received an arc in exchange for an honest review....At first I was totally confused! I didn't realise the ENTIRE book was going to be written thru text, letters and emails. Future letters, present day letters, past letters, etc. I really had to pay attention!I have never read a book in this format before and am still not sure if I liked it. The format that is.. the story I loved, just not sure about how it was told.Instead of being told after the fact, "he kissed me last night", I wanted to experience it in the moment, read it as it happened... so I could feel it and imagine it.That being said, I did very much enjoy the story. The future letters the girls wrote in high school were pretty typical with how teens think their lives will turn out, but as the story progresses, their lives and circumstances take them on a completely different journey. I especially loved Dylan's letters. They were so sweet and loving.At one point I cried!! It was totally unexpected!Although I had a suspicion somewhere in the beginning of how certain things were going to happen with a certain someone.... not going to say who or what....but I was SO not expecting the shocker I got, nor did I think THAT was going to happen!!!So... sweet, funny, cute, sad and different. I recommend giving it a try .
What an intriguing add:&#34; will meet you on Wednesdayskissing onlywon't touch you below the shouldersno dating, no hookupsno picture necessary&#34;Why the odd meeting? Why the odd requests? What is he hiding? What is his story??READ IT and find out!!This was a quick read that kept me interested the entire time!Carrie is a librarian, leading a normal life with friends and family that love her.. but she isn't content. She wants love, she wants a companion.She reads the want adds to pass the time and make her laugh.. until she stumbles across his.Brian is a lawyer, also looking for something.. but all he has to spare in his chaotic life is one hour of his time, one day a week. He makes the time because he desperately needs it. He needs to be touched, cared for, to get lost in a kiss if only for a moment.It was funny, sexy and quite touching. I enjoyed the quirkiness of the characters, the passion between Carrie and Brian and the vulnerability, sensitivity and compassion displayed by Brian.It was truly a beautiful story.*I received an arc provided by NetGalley in exchange for an honest review .
I received a copy of A Moment in exchange for an honest review... and I want to say thank you!!I really enjoyed this book.Suicide, abuse, teen pregnancy, illness, abandonment, etc... yet it wasn't over the top and in your face. It was an easy going, sweet love story.I loved what a strong woman Lili was, the connection between her and Ryan, the integration of the Spanish... and the moments with Lili and Javi were beautiful and brought tears to my eyes .
Ok, so I am not quite sure how to rate this. I guess overall I can say I liked it?!There was a lot I enjoyed about the book, but I just don't think I can get over all the goofy/cheesy lines! haha This story could have really been great!I honestly wanted to stop reading from early on, but I kept seeing sparks of something good, only to be rolling my eyes a couple pages later!Overall it was a good story, funny, sweet, sad at times, a hint of danger- albeit lame danger, sexy... but who says these things?Crudsickles? Fiddle Sticks? Jiminy Cricket? Come on! Who says that?? And in the middle of sex?? hahaI just couldn't get over it.Even Nik one minute was a bad-ass, tatted alpha male and the next he says "yeesh you knucklehead"!!I understand Tina is supposed to be good and wholesome, and that's great and sweet, but seriously, she turned into Gomer Pyle from "The Andy Griffith Show"! All that was missing was a "Well Gooollly .
3.5 starsThis is the story of Jack, a former fire fighter injured in the line of duty. He now owns a cleaning company that specializes in crime scenes.I had never thought of that before. What happens after a crime has taken place? Who comes in to clean the blood and what not that was left behind? In this story, The Brothers Grime do. It was interesting actually.A couple parts of the story were a little gruesome, with all the talk of "blood splatter" and "brain and bone matter". yuck But that was only part of the story.The rest is about Jack. He has a secret he keeps from everyone, except his closest handful of friends some of which also happen to be his co-workers.This secret, regarding his first love Nick, is brought to the surface when he gets a phone call informing him of Nick's suicide.Attempting to bid for the suicide clean up job, Jack meets Ryan.. Nick's cousin.Jack and Ryan begin to immediately form a bond. Their relationship picks up pretty quickly and some steaminess emerges!I loved Jack's character. He craves love and companionship, but he also fears it.He overcame such  tragedy not just once, with what happened in high school, but twice, with his accident. Going from a rough and tough fireman to living with a knee replacement, constant pain and scars.This story is about loss and love, but also about the problems the characters face with their homosexuality (whether it's being ostracized from family, being bullied and beated or afraid of coming out to others).It isn't all sadness and gloom though. Jack and his friends have a great brotherhood/bond that is present throughout. I enjoyed the other characters as well and can see future books! Dave's story should be told next!There's also plenty of joking and laughter. And lets not forget about the "Token Chick"!!I liked Grime and Punishment but felt like a few things could have been different. I would have liked the ending to not have come so quickly! I wanted a little more of Jack and Ryan's romance.. it seemed to happen so quickly. Also, I wanted more about Nick. Did his suicide have anything to do with Jack? Will we ever find out?*copy provided by NetGalley in exchange for an honest review .
I received and arc from the author via Netgalley in exchange for an honest review.If you're looking for a fun, erotic read without getting attached, then read Unscrupulous! I like it, but in my honest opinion, this is not a re-read, can't get the characters out of your head, stay with you forever, to die for novel.Instead, it was a sassy, crude, funny, sexy, fun read! Definitely a "Sex in the City" type story.Taddy praying to "sweet baby Jesus" in the club when she spots Warner, hilarious!This is ultimately the story of Taddy, a self-made millionaire with intimacy issues and Warner, a hot and confident billionaire. Unfortunately, there was too much plot/climax.. no pun intended, as far as all the characters go. And there were just too many characters.Taddy with her parents abandonment, Birdie and Lex, Blake and his husband, Warner's wife's death, Kiki the assistant, Vive and her drinking, Rielle and her crazy mess, Countess Irma's request... etc. Maybe a little too much going on??I would have liked to have read more of just Taddy and Warner. More of a romance. I understand there is such a thing as an immediate connection, but falling into "I love you" after 2 days? Not so realistic.Needles to say, lots of money, jet setting, dirty talk, hot sex, champagne, love and a HEA .
I received an arc in exchange for an honest review.So, when I was offered a chance to read and review Ice Games, I hadn't realized this was a Games Novel! I didn't even notice the author's name! (silly me) It sounded good, so I agreed. Well, imagine my surprise when I started reading this funny, cute, steamy book that shared many similarities to Wicked Games.. another cute, funny, steamy book that I LOVE! DUH!! I must have had some good juju going to get an arc of a series that I love and not even know it!! :-)Ice Games is about Zara, a has-been figure skater being paired up with Ty, a bad-boy MMA fighter for a "Skating with the Stars" type tv show.Zara is sarcastic, funny, uber talented and a virgin.Ty is hot, dangerous and not happy about having to be figure skating!He turns out to be a pretty good skater, a really nice guy and pretty darn steamy! Zara and Ty on the couch...HOT!!!I would have liked to have had more about Ty's bad boy persona and frankly a little bit longer book... but loved it anyway!Quick read, super fun and sexy .
2.5-3 starsSo I'm on the fence a bit about this one. I was looking forward to reading Shredded and was quite happy to have actually received an ARC!Unfortunately it fell a little flat for my taste.I liked the premise of the story... talented yet troubled pro-snowboarder falls for new girl in town who's secretly troubled herself... unfortunately it was just ok for me.It was an easy, quick read with more of a mature YA feel to it.He's a reckless bad boy who turns out to be not so bad after all, and she's... well, I'm not sure what she is. Maybe my lack of connection with Ophelia is one of the reasons this book was just ok for me.I did enjoy the supporting characters. Z's friends Cam, Ash and Luc seemed real and I can see potential for other story lines and books down the line with them. I thought Z's story was sad and liked how he looked out for Ophelia because of his past.*I received an ARC via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review .
3.5 starsI am stuck somewhere between liked and loved it!Aubree, as much as she tries to be perfect, knows that that is simply on the outside. Inside she is damaged and bruised. What she eventually learns is that everyone in some way or another is flawed.. but that's what makes them who they are.A Perfect Mess is the story of Aubree and Booker. They grew up together thru middle and high school, admiring each other from afar. One tragic night brought them together and also drove them apart.  Now she's back and forced to face the people and secrets she ran from, and that includes Booker Outlaw!Booker is one of the Outlaw triplets. He is YUMMY!Yes, I said triplets! They are gorgeous, talented and passionate, they sing and play instruments. ..... and there's three of them!!! Can you say more books?? Yes please!The story is told in both his and her pov, which I LOVED! Her version has you thinking he's a total bad ass, while his divulges his tenderness and raw emotions. Still being a bad ass of course.There was SO much going on in this story: lots of characters, many story lines, several twists, humor, sadness, mystery.  Most of it I really liked and some of it was just a little unlikely. Not very believable and that's what had me not falling over in love with it.There's mystery and suspense. She's hiding secrets that keep getting hinted at.  One of them was easy to figure out. There's also sweetness and caring. Booker has been in love with Aubree since he first saw her. He's protective of her and that makes him SO hot! There's chemistry and passion, but it's not over the top explicit.  You also learn about her friends and his brothers. Everyone has their own story and their own secrets to hide.You also get a little taste of Louisiana... not to mention small town life. There's frog giggin, Cajun cookin, fiddle playin, and lots of everyone in your business and gossiping!The few things that turned me off a bit or that just didn't seem right were the Outlaw triplet's age.  Booker was a huge success, cars, money, houses and only 19. Roughly 9 months out of high school. Also, the Aunt/momma story towards the end was a little out of left field. I also found a few editing errors here and there, but it didn't necessary take away from the story.I enjoyed reading A Perfect Mess and will definitely read more from Zoe Dawson in the future.*copy provided by NetGalley in exchange for an honest review .
WOW! From the beginning to the end, Arsen is one big emotional roller coaster!I cried, I cringed, I cried again. It was incredibly sexy and somewhat erotic at times. Then you get a bout of sweetness.. SO much love and tenderness. There's betrayal and loss. Again, roller coaster ride you won't want to get off!The story is told mostly thru Cathy's pov with past and present chapters. Along the way you get both Ben and Arsen's pov a couple of times. I really enjoyed it like that.You are immediately introduced to Cathy and given a punch in the gut with what has broken her. Gut wrenching sadness. Have your tissues handy.Along the way you get Ben and Cathy's beautiful story of love and adoration. I SO am in love with Ben and felt so horribly bad for him. Ben is the perfect man and husband who was so intensely in love with his wife. Nobody and nothing existed outside of his wife Cathy.In walks Arsen!! He is young, rich and hot. Not an emotional guy into attachments and responsibility, right? Wrong. I LOVED Arsen also. I felt for him too. I was SO angry and upset about 80% in with Arsen, I couldn't believe what was happening. Thank god for the Epilogue.. but it crushed me to pieces!!! CRUSHED me!!I originally gave Arsen 4 stars because of a couple of reasons... I do not like cheaters. Cathy was broken, in many ways... but all could have been avoided if she'd only been honest and opened up to Ben. Then again, everything happens for a reason and the story couldn't have ended the way it had, had she not cheated.Also, there was a point towards the end where it just jumped ahead years and I was unhappy! I wanted to know what happened during that time!BUT, I honestly can't get this book out of my head! That alone makes it 5 stars!!Arsen is a MUST READ! Crazy emotional .
The Other C-Word captivated me from the beginning! It was cute, clever and comical! Ok.. no more c words for me!Marley is closed off. She doesn't do relationships and with good reason. Rick is sexy, flirtatious and determined! There's obvious chemistry between the two but Marley tries desperately to keep her distance. Even after the two of them become involved, there are certain secrets she just can't share with Rick.The beginning was hysterical! I could not stop laughing out loud! R U Randy???As the story progressed things between Marley and Rick got pretty steamy. Not only was he a possessive alpha, but he was also an old fashion gentleman. I loved his character! And the fact he resembles Chris Pine didn't hurt either!I very much enjoyed Marley's family dynamics. Her sisters and mother brought lots of tenderness and laughter to the story. I also felt for Dillon, her best friend. I'd like a book on him! That would be an interesting story!!!It was very sweet, cute, funny, sad at times and very enjoyable. I felt the ending was a tad rushed though. I was happy with how things ended, but would have liked a more drawn out happy ending .
I received an arc in exchange for an honest review.Let me say that student-teacher romances are right up my alley. I LOVE them.Unfortunately this book didn't quite cut it for me.After reading other reviews of amazing chemistry, laugh out loud funny, tears, etc etc.. I was foaming at the mouth excited... but then was sorely disappointed. I didn't get any of that.I found this story to be pretty boring. It took me several days to read it because I kept putting it down. It didn't keep my interest.What did I like about it?? Um... I thought a couple moments with Brandon were a little funny. The Nick Cage cutout and all.. but far cry from laughing out loud.What I didn't like?? A lot.To narrow it down, I didn't feel the forbiddenness from a usual student-techer romance. There wasn't much angst or passion. It was very lackadaisical and just boring.The "tease"?? WTF was that about? I don't get it. Who does that? It was just weird.Also, the way Ben spoke made him seem much too old. He acted a bit too pompous, too philosophical and intellectual. Turns out he was 26? It didn't make any sense.There were also some grammatical errors, but that I can get over. :)I'm surprised I actually finished it .
Where do I start??Well, there's definite hotness that's for sure.So Lily has been cheated on and dumped. She decides to turn over a new leaf and explore her sexuality.. having just lost an 8 year relationship with her first and only partner.In doing so she meets Seb. He's rich, hot, owns a kink club (so to speak) and is married!The story that unravels is full of surprises. There's twists and turns, you're not sure what exactly is going on at times and then it just ends! Book two in the works??Lets back up... Lily is pretty damn hilarious! I laughed out loud a few times that's for sure. The sex is hot! There's plenty of kink, some girl on girl, a threesome, light BDSM, etc etc.There's the beginnings of a romance/relationship between Lily and Seb.. but then things get weird and eventually certain circumstances prevent them from being together.I liked a lot of the book, the puns and wittiness, the hot factor, the fact that they were British and used words like "knickers and cuppa" .. but there were things I didn't care for.Maybe I just don't care for the open relationship/sharing thing. That always weirds me out. And there's lots of that in here.There were some grammatical/editing errors also, nothing terrible but noticeable. And then the fact that it just ended sort of on a cliffhanger.Am not sure if I'll read the next one. I enjoyed the eroticism of the book, but not sure if I really felt for the characters enough to find out what happens next.*I received an arc in exchange for an honest review***Update to Sept 12th review.... I recently read "Untaming Lily Wilde" again. I forgot to mention previously how much this book reminds me of "Bridget Jones's Diary". (that's a good thing, I LOVE BJD!)I also caught a few things the second time around that I found interesting... knowing looks and little reactions by the characters. Certain things make more sense now. Also, I have a new outlook on Christoph. (one of Lily's "partners") I think the first time I read it, I was a bit upset with how things had ended.. but in reading again, I am intrigued to find out just what path Lily will take next. I think I will read the next one .
Play by Play is about an outspoken, good looking, ex football player turned sports blogger named Jake that meets a new tenant in his building's elevator.No woman has been able to turn Jake's head lately until "elevator girl" comes along. Only problem is, his charm isn't exactly making her panties melt. What's a guy to do? He blogs about her!! They eventually become friends, date, fall in love and live happily ever after! Great story right?? WRONG!! Sometimes something sounds like a good plan... but then it doesn't exactly turn out to work as well as you had envisioned!Well, it sounded like it could have been a good story. I'd love to read that book! Could have been really cute too, but sadly it wasn't. It was pretty much a cheesy, early 90s after school sitcom.Jake- "Man, you're perfect. You know that?"Sophie- "We're perfect. Together. Oh Jake!" ... that was their first date!?It was very PG, aside from the couple of curse words... God forbid! It mentioned flirting and making out... when? I missed it. Pretty anticlimactic and predictable struggle(his with the lying, hers with the "I don't want a jock.. I do want a jock!") followed by an unbelievable and unrealistic ending.  He gets the girl, his dream job and everything he's ever wanted! And they lived happily ever after!I didn't care for Sophie's character at all and overall, the book was entirely too silly for me.*I received an arc provided by NetGalley in exchange for an honest review .
I enjoyed this quick, kinky, forbidden student/teacher tale. It was both funny and naughty!Having a bit of a troubled past, James is now struggling to improve himself and his grades. Not above offering himself sexually, he approaches his rumored pervert history professor with a plan to better his grade.Unbeknownst to James, Professor Carson has a bit of a dominant nature and offers a slightly unconventional tutoring session instead. James agrees, but has no idea what he's gotten himself into!Professor Carson is a silver fox, a hottie with a Scottish accent!  yummyJames? Hmph, it didn't really say what he looked like, but I can use my imagination.I loved James's sense of humor as well as his vulnerability.  At first he was scared, angry and embarrassed. Professor Carson actually spanked him! But then he realized how much he enjoyed it, craved it. It wasn't just the hot spanking sessions he wanted, but Professor Carson's approval, companionship and maybe his love?*arc provided by NetGalley in exchange for an honest review .
2.5 starsGrace is sent by her boss to retrieve his grandson Jack, a man she has secretly been in love with.The story starts off funny and cute when she arrives at the island Jack has been living on. They share some "intimate" moments and sparks fly. Grace ends up falling deeper in love and also broken hearted.I was expecting a little more drama after reading the synopsis, but there really wasn't any.This was a quick, cute read that kept me entertained for the time being, but overall needed a little something extra to make it more memorable. It flowed well and I enjoyed Grace and Jack's chemistry, but it needed a little kick!The ending and Jack's epiphany happened rather quickly for my taste, but like most, I do enjoy a HEA which is what you got.*arc provided by NetGalley in exchange for an honest review .
Broken Beauty is a short novella and the first in a series of six. I loved this emotional story and couldn't put it down.This is the story of a young girl named Mia who is brutally raped at a party by two men, one of which she knows.I was drawn in from the very beginning when she awakened after the rape. It was just heartbreaking. The events that followed had me going thru a range of emotions. I felt sadness one moment and anger the next. The love and support from Mia's family was nonexistent.  Her politician father seemed to care more about his campaign and reputation than he did for his own daughter.  He didn't even come to the hospital after having learned of his daughter's rape.Luckily Mia did have her best friend Ari by her side and the support of Dom, one of the police officers that found her. Dom is handsome, kind and makes her feel safe.I liked how even thru all the pain and anguish, Mia was still thinking sarcastic and funny thoughts. The added humor was just enough to not have me bawling my eyes out.This is an eye opening account of the hardships a victim goes thru. You're with her for the aftermath, thru the nightmares she remembers from that night to the new nightmares she lives during the day. She's afraid they'll find her again. She's afraid of crowds, noises, and even open spaces.  The guilt she feels. Was it her fault? Did she bring it on herself?  It truly is an emotional story.This first installment in the series is not a romance. This solely is about Mia, the rape and aftermath. Although the author does an excellent job at giving details about that night, there is not a graphic/vulgar description of the actual rape. Don't be afraid to read it.Also, the hope of a future with Dom lingers in the air. I can feel it! I'm a sucker for romance and happy endings. I look forward to the next novella in the series and pray that happier moments are in store for Mia. She's a fighter and an inspiration... even if she doesn't believe it.On a side note- has anyone else felt that there's something up with Chris, her uncle?? I think he's hiding something.*arc provided by NetGalley in exchange for an honest review .
3.5 starsSo before I start on how much I liked this book, and I really did, I have to ask Belle Aurora why?? In between all the funny and sexy dirty talk there's a completely ridiculous word thrown in that frankly is just idiotic!Pee-pee!! Pee-pee?? Really? How old are you Lily??And she clearly knew other words, as displayed in her little word fumble...Lily- &#34;What do you want to dick?&#34;Stupid. Stupid. Stupid.&#34;What do you want to drink?&#34;Nox- &#34;A coke will do.&#34;Lily- &#34;Sure babe. One cock. I mean cock. I mean coke!&#34;That part, among a few others, was a little heavy on the cheese!And Boo?? BOO?I really liked her character.... her name, not so much!Ok, now that that is out of the way... I really did like this story!! hahaLily meets Nox in an unconventional way.... when he kidnaps her! Or does he?? This instantly ignites a love/hate relationship.Lily is a virgin. In every way you can be!!She's also sassy, spunky, curious and unknowingly beautiful.Nox is rugged, unemotional, handsome and somewhat detached. Until Lily of course!Kidnapping, blackmail, explosions, death... this story has all of that, but it's not gritty and suspenseful. Instead it's light and funny.Some parts are a tad silly and others pretty damn funny. There also comes a moment of sadness and pain to which I actually got teary eyed!There's love and sweetness and sex! Not crazy hot monkey sex, but some sex nonetheless!I enjoyed all the characters, including Rock and Boo. They were funny, sweet and had a great relationship.At times Lily annoyed me, but I got over it.SO.... I really did enjoy this book and regardless of the placement of silly and totally ridiculous words, I shall read more from Belle Aurora .
I was intrigued and very excited to read a story where the heroine is a bad-ass female assassin!&#34;Bullet&#34; is just that, cold, calculated, hard as nails, emotionless, fearless.. and a killer.She was bred to be. She and her sisters (fellow assassins) were stripped of their childhood and ergo a normal life and instead trained/tortured into becoming the women they are today.Bullet's story is packed with action, intrigue and suspense. Bullet is definitely a kick-ass, strong-willed heroine. I loved her!Add a leading man, Rand Beckett and you have scorching hot chemistry mixed with hatred and lust! Some very hot moments I tell you!Put those together with a gut-wrenching tale of torture and pain and there you have Bullet to the Heart.Hot and steamy, yes.. action packed, yes... sad and tortured tale, yes.. but throughout it all I was left wanting more.Her story although incredibly emotional and sad did not bring me to tears. :( I wanted tears! The addition of Russian and French phrases was awesome... but I don't speak either and had no clue what they were saying! (the translations are in the back of the book, which I found out after I read the story) :(It also ended a little abruptly for me. I was happy and not so much with the end. Seeing as how my Kindle said I was only at 82% I was anticipating more! I had quite a big WTF? moment. Not a cliffhanger mind you... just an open ended story leaving room for the next assassin to tell hers .
I really enjoyed Play. It was funny and sexy with a touch of sad.Mal's antics were hilarious and borderline Energizer bunny with ADHD!!I can honestly say that I did not care too much for Anne in the beginning, but she grew on me as did Mal's crazy ways.His texting had me bursting out loud laughing!!Mal: High levels of unhealthy codependency traits exhibited by both parties relationship possibly bordering on toxic.Anne: WTF?Mal: Did magazine quiz. We need help. Especially youPlay was a quick, easy going read with loads of funny banter.I can't wait for Lead and Jimmy .
This story was just what I was looking for!It was a quick, funny, sarcastic, sexy read.Don't let the synopsis fool you though. There is sadness in this story... there's also love and sweetness.Emerald is all those things, funny, sarcastic, sexy...she is also pretty f***ed up!But it's not her fault, it's her mother's.The &#34;lessons&#34; passed down by her mother made me cringe!&#34;You need to be beautiful on the outside....&#34;&#34;Beauty wins over brains every time...&#34;&#34;Don't make friends...&#34;&#34;If you can't get anything out of someone or use them for a specific purpose, kick that person out of your life ASAP.&#34;From her less than stellar customer service skills...&#34;Starbucks Bistro. What's your name and what do you want?&#34;To her church loving grandparents...&#34;praise Jesus&#34;I laughed throughout.And then there's Carter Black. YUMMYHe lets Emerald be herself without judgement. He's through and through a true gentleman. A sexy and charming true gentleman!Can't wait for the next book .
This was a rather naughty, raunchy, funny and just all around entertaining quick read!The story is about Jace and Adrienne... but also includes Jace's buddies and fellow sexy as hell escorts Troy, Nico, Marc and Kade, as well as Adrienne's bff Emilie.Lots of laugh out loud moments with this group!!"She likes to have food and stuff smeared on her, then eaten off.""Too bad she wanted f***in' baked beans and ketchup rubbed all over her! That s*** is nasty."If you're in the mood for some dirty sex with a side of sweet romance and happily ever after, then this is a great book for you!I enjoyed all the characters and can't wait to read the next one!!"Here's to the people we f***, here's to the people who f*** us, if the people we f*** are f***ing with us, f*** them and here's to us .
Honestly I didn&#8217;t really even read the synopsis. It didn't matter what it was about. Christine Zolendz writes a new book, I buy it!I loved it!! I also loved the dual povs!! Getting into the mind of both characters, especially one like Kade is just fantastic!This story starts you off with Samantha running from her life bloodied and bruised. You immediately fall in love with her for her strength and bravery. She is also kind, gentle and caring.Cue Kade. Talk about tall dark and handsome!! He is also unbelievably arrogant, disturbing and quite frankly an a**hole!Kade has a vivid and gruesome imagination, which makes him an excellent horror writer. Unfortunately his thoughts all stem from a horrid event from his childhood which has changed him forever.The two have a sort of love/hate relationship. What is it about him that she can&#8217;t stop thinking about him? His eyes, the way he watches her, his intensity.And there's just something about her that has him bewitched. He can&#8217;t think, he can&#8217;t write, he&#8217;s mesmerized by her.This isn't all about being dark, creepy and suspenseful.... it's actually quite funny, sexy as hell and a touch emotional.Can't wait to read more .
Loved it!!!As with all Susan Mac Nicol books I have read, Waiting For Rain is laugh out loud funny, witty, and sexy as hell! And although not a sad story, there was a moment of sadness that had me almost in tears!Toby and Rain have an instant and electrifying chemistry. They also both harbor sordid pasts and secrets that if kept hidden could possibly ruin their future together.Love how Susan always writes about strong men having overcome adversity. This story is no different.Toby and Rain are yummy! Did I mention Rain is a sexy carpenter that likes to pole dance? If only novels came with streaming video, I'd be golden!&#34;You are so bloody sexy. I want to wear you.&#34;There's also a supporting cast of friends that brought lots of humor and tenderness to the mix.&#34;What is it with you straight women and your fascination with gay-man sex?&#34;I thoroughly enjoyed this book, especially all the British lingo I as an American don't hear everyday! Words like bloody, git, and bollocks!Thank you Susan Mac Nicol for another great read .
I received an arc in exchange for an honest review.3.5 starsFirst off, let me say WOW! The beginning started off with a bang of a revelation. One hell of a start to a story.Unfortunately it got a little slow for me after that. I wasn't THAT into it. Not sure what, but there was something missing.THEN, things got a little steamy, a little heated, feelings were shared, secrets were revealed, and a huge bomb was dropped!!!! UGH, poor Ava!!I'm SO glad I continued on because I was not disappointed in the end. Except for the cliffhanger ending!! :(But, I am definitely anxiously awaiting the sequel Divinely Living .
WOW, this book was SEXY!!!Not only did I love how sweet this book is, but IMO this one is the sexiest and hottest of the series!!Phillip has given Shea (my favorite) a run for his money!All the characters from the previous books make an appearance, so if you're a lover of the Assassins series, you'll be very happy .
Can I possibly love Ella Frank any more than I already do?? Yes.. Yes I can, and I do!!Take is AMAZING! I expect funny, sad, sweet and HOT from Ella Frank and she delivered tenfold!!The story picks up right where Try leaves off. Tate and Logan's relationship is new and scary for both of them and they each have hurdles to overcome.Fans of the Exquisite and Temptation series will be extremely happy. You get what you're waiting for when it comes to the boys and you will not be disappointed with the addition of all the previous characters who make an appearance!There are so many emotions going on in this book. I laughed out loud, I got teary eyed, I was aroused!! I was aroused!! Did I mention being aroused?You see a vulnerability in Logan that you didn't know was there. There are struggles that actually brought tears to my eyes! I'm not talking ugly cry, entire box of tissues, but wow, incredible, emotional moments for sure!**If heartache had a face, it was Tate's right then,**There is also bookoo steam! Much more than the first book and let me tell you....OMG! Wow!! Wow!!**Logan sucked Tate's taut skin betwen his lips until he heard him curse at the sting of pain.**I could quote SO MANY steamy and favorite parts.. but I want you to experience it for yourself!!You must definitely read Try before Take, and trust me.. you will not be disappointed! Bring on book 3, although I don't want Logan and Tate's story to ever end. Book 4? 5? We should be so lucky!Lady-boner for Ella still going strong!!!*I was fortunate enough to receive an advanced copy from the author .
Body Games is the next installment in the Games series.This time we are taken back to Endurance Island.. but with a cheeky twist thrown in! ;)Just like reality tv shows, it doesn't matter how many seasons or in this case books, there's always new characters, new drama, a villain and a showmance!!! And this book delivers!!- &#34;I was pretty sure my girly bits were sunburned and I had sand in inappropriate areas.&#34;Annabelle is strong, funny and looking to make up for how the show portrayed her the last time she was on... the &#34;stupid bimbo&#34;.Jendan is strong, gorgeous and sweet.. and trying to get out of the &#34;nice guys always finish last&#34; category.This story is a quick, easy going read that will have you laughing. There's also a few sweet and tender moments mixed in with some sexy steam!I love both reality tv and books.. so receiving an advanced copy of Body Games in exchange for an honest review was like winning a ticket to the Survivor Finale! Awesome .
I was expecting a PURPLE Ipad case. I didn't get that, I got a plain black one. I order whats in the picture, and didn't get that .
I have yet to read a Feehan book that I want to put down! This one was no differant I only wish she could write faster ;D .
I have never failed to have trouble putting down one of Fern Michaels books. This one is no differant in that aspect. The four stories in this book allow you to read through one and put the book down to get to needed things in life, only to pick it up again for the next story. All are well written and keep you wanting more .
I love the writing, the story line is great. I did not realize that serial meant that the one book came is small weekly installments. I thought there were multiple books in a series. I read to much and to fast for this book to keep me going for more than 20 minutes. The writing is great I just wish I could read the whole book .
I grew up with my mother using the diamond deb. I remember searching for a replacement when hers got to smooth after more than two decades, it was a long time to find one before the internet. I have had many nail files but wanted a diamond deb so I went to Amazon and there it was. If no one borrows this one I know I will have it for a long time. Every woman should have this file in her purse .
Haven't played it much yet but seems fun. Not a big challenge but great for kids. Graphics are neat but game goes by fast. Would probably help if I read the instructions first ;D .
Having brothers I can relate to this story. I could not wait to find out what came next. Really hated having to stop reading and will now get the rest in the series .
Book 3 and I still can't put them down. Good thing I have to work so I can get more books or I would have them all read by now. I will definitely not like when I get to the last one .
I enjoyed the riveting accounts of boats sinking in the icy waters around Alaska and the ensuing rescues. Spike Walkwr makes you feel like you are in the icy waters with the men who have to abandon their boat suddenly. I have tried to imagine floating in seas where there is 100 feet from wave top to bottom of the trough.thestories were thrilling and I didn't want to put the book down. Keep it up, Mr. Walker .
Great description of climbing Mt Everest without going into the minute details of everything they took and the hike in to get to the mountain. I enjoyed the descriptions of getting dressed and efforts to climb. Thanks for giving the Sherpas credit. I liked her explanations of her feelings and outlook on life. I hope I can keep that positive feeling I feel after reading her book. It is not a sappy book, but one written by a confident, successful woman .
When two tankers broke apart in a horrific storm off the Atlantic coast of the United States in 1952, the Coast Guard went to the rescue in a small boat in towering seven-story seas and 60 knot winds. Every moment of the rescue from the Coasties' perspective and the survivors' on the two tankers are chronicled in exciting detail .
The most remarkable rescue in the mountains I have ever read. The unusual event of a lightning strike effecting 13 climbers on a mountain up high in the Tetons was intense. The rescue by the highly trained park climbing rangers and helicopter pilots in extreme circumstances was riveting. The descriptions of the characters' backgrounds became a little tedious, but helped the reader understand why they performed as they did. I liked the explanation of lightning and its effects on people and the surroundings. I could not put it down .
I enjoyed this book because it covered the massacre and expeditions that had so much tragedy. I liked it because it was very recent coverage of the events that I had read a few tidbits about on the internet. Very easy read and couldn't put it down .
The product appears to be what I was looking for. The first time I purchased one it arrived nonoperational. I wasn't able to exchange it for a new one, so I sent it back to get a refund. When I ordered it the second time, it arrived nonoperational as well .
WARNING! DO NOT BUY! I have had multiple jars of passions touch body scrub before. when I got this in the mail it wasn't even the rite product I ordered! It was a jar of green tea body scrub! And if I'm not mistaken, it had been opened before! There was absolutely no kind of sealence and the outside of the jar was all scratched! I decided to try the product, and when I did it sucked! Very unhappy! A waste of my money and time .
This was filled with everything that you could possibly think of for learning the guitar. If you're a beginner or if you have been playing for awhile this book is amazing. I love the fact that it is interactive with, my tablet. That was the best part about this book besides the many other wonderful things. Everything is very simple to understand when it says &#34;step by steps lessons&#34; it isn't lying.After my purchase I came back on  to look at the other books available, and saw that they have a childrens book for learning the guitar. I will be purchasing that also soon for my son. Since this book was so easy to read and so amazing with it being interactive with tablets, my son will have so much fun learning to play. I loved how it can go with your tablet, laptop, pc, and even smartphones. Great product all around. I am thrilled with the ease of this book, and the quality of the lessons .
The phone was I received was in awesome condition. The screen is gorgeous and the battery life is great too! Way better than my old Galaxy Nexus. I sold my old Nexus because the battery life was horrendous, my newly obtained Gs3 quickly put my fears to rest after having spend a whole day with it. The camera is decent enough for a smartphone, keep in mind it's nothing you'll get on a DSLR, but it is one of the best Cameras on any smartphone currently. As far as speed goes, it's pretty zippy and I've experienced no lag. So far, this phone has been awesome.However, the phone I recieved was blocked from Network access by att. Meaning it was reported stolen/lost and now it's basically useless unless you're in a wifi hotspot. I inserted my H20 sim and tried making a phone call, but it said "This device is restricted from Network service". I talked to a person from att and they confirmed that the phone was reported. I suggest contacting the seller and inquire about the phone thoroughly before purchasing .
It is a good saw blade just it does not last long enough for the professional standard.  Dewalt should properly heat treat this saw blade with the professional quality standard to make it last longer and state sharp all the time .
Took me three hours to replace all 12 plugs on my ML 320.  Once I quick started the ML320, I already felt the engine was running smoother than the old plugs (NGK Mercedes Plugs). I took the vehicle out for a high speed ride on the highway, I could feel the quick and smooth acceleration.  I watched the fuel gauge and I could see the plugs gave me a better mileage.  Even though the old plugs are NGK Mercedes plugs, I can feel the NGK old technology is not as good as the NGK new technology plugs.  I should replaced the old plugs (45K miles) sooner.  It is well worth the money for these 12 new plugs .
This chain is sharp and stay sharp until you finished your job.  Off couse don't let it touch the ground.  Stay away from Oregon .
I bought few Oregan bar and chain combos for my Husky 460 chainsaw.  They all terrible and the oil was not feeding right and it created a lot of grease dirt on the saw.  Finally decided to buy this original bar and the original 20 inches chain for my saw.  My saw performed like new again .
After I searched on the Amazon site, I decided to purchase one of this because it has 8 db gain.  I made a big mistake. I connected this amplifier with my antenna and the TV with a cable more than 20 ft away.  Signal lost a lot down.  I got most local channels 4, 5, 7, 9. I got some channels farther away but those channels either came with frozen video or broke up digital pixels.  This TV amplifier is only good if you connect it directly from the antenna to a TV.  It is not stronge enough to power with any splitter with a long cable. It is not better than a RadioShack amplifier cost less. Anyway, it is better than nothing. It comes with 90 days warranty.  Should get the 8 splitter of the same model for 2 dollars more.  At less it comes with 5 years warranty for a piece of crab .
I have an old 50 miles antenna, it is so large that I couldn't mount inside my house.  I bought another old 50 miles antenna but still it is kind of wide to install inside my house.  This antenna is small, very small that I can mount it any place inside or outside of the house.  It is powerful enough to pick up over 39 HD channels.  Just the mounting post already worth $19.99.  I wonder why they don't make this antenna long time ago .
I have tried two HoneyWell WiFi 7 days programming thermostats.  Both non-stopped at set temperture and made the heat pump running dry like crazy.  Saw this LuxPro thermostat and downloaded owner's manual, it has temperature swing adjustments, cycle rate adjustments, humidity adjustments, 7 days programming, kilowatt meter, and many features only on the expansive thermostats.  Ordered one and installed in less than 30 minutes.  Super easy to install.  Turned the heating system on, the thermostat lighted up and controlled the heating pump and fan running at the set temperature.  In few minutes the heating system stopped at the set temperature.  Used the advanced adjustments to fine tune the thermostat for my Trane heat pump system.  The thermostat controlled the heat pump so nicely at the set temperature.  The auxiliary heater turned on after the heat pump was running in few minutes.  In less than 20 minutes the heat pump and the auxiliary heater stopped at the set temperature.  The heat pump cycles at the set cycle rate.  This thermostat controls the heat pump (1h/1c or 2h/1c or 3h/2c) so nicely and accurately to save energy, save money, and stop at the set temperature.The only CON is Lux company discontinued this model, but I don't care as long as mine is working fine eventhough this could be the last one for my HVAC system .
I bought this saw for cutting water pipes.  Instead, I used this saw to cut down a dead 8 inches diameter 60 ft tall tree.  Used two blades to finished the whole job including cut down the tree and cut the trunk into small sections.  The gear housing was a little bit warm, not too bad for such a job.  It is less powerful than a chainsaw but the cost of two blades is less than 1/3 price of a chain.  The 8.5 amp motor is so powerful for regular and orbital motions.  The easy blade lock feature is very nice.  It takes few seconds to replace a blade. It takes more than 10 minutes to replace a chainsaw chain.  For a small job like cutting a tree less than 12 inches diameter, I would like to use this saw instead of my Husky 460 Rancher chainsaw.  Vibration is so low when cutting woods.  I should get one more last time when the price dropped to $45 plus $11 shipping. I ordered a second one for $60 just after I finished my review. The saw is so nice.  It comes with a plastic box and a 6 inches bi-metal blade .
The saw is smaller than my Tiger saw.  However, this saw has vibration more than my Tiger saw.  It bend a saw blade after few minutes used of the saw.  The saw shaft is not perfectly made to the straight and heat treatment standard.  You can feel the &#34;play&#34; of the shaft mounted inside the housing.  If Dewalt can reduce the vibration and properly heat treated the shaft and the clamp mount of the saw, it should meet the professional standard .
Took pictures with this Canon T4i.  The pictures looked nice on the LCD screen.  However, when I displayed the pictures on my laptop, the pictures are terrible.  The grains are large and the pictures are not sharp.  It performs worst than my Canon T1i.  Stay away from Canon and get a Nikon next time .
Put up a new pressure regulator and a new On/Off valve for my 22 years old house.  This pressure regulator is so easy to install.  No welding just some cutting jobs.  Planned the water pipe system and took less than 30 minutes to put everythings together.  Nice and beautiful.  You can see my video at youtube.com .
This is a good replacement for the original equipment for the old model GPS devices.  There is no traffic antenna built in to receive traffic signals .
Upgraded Windows 8 Pro to Windows 8.1 Pro for free.  Everything works fine except the front camera resolution is very poor quality below any acceptable so called Pro quality.  The pictures took indoor are grainy, poor white balance, and large pixels.  No adjustment for the camera.  Only can change limited quality of the picture. The battery power is about 4 hrs below 5 hrs for 50% of brightness. The device is very warm all over because of the processor is 3rd generation i5.  The new Pro 2 uses a 4th generation i5 Haswell processor is much better, but it is not worth to spend $400 extra dollars for the processor.  Should consider Samsung tablet with the same Windows 8 base operating system with better camera.  The Surface Pro is fast and the 128 gb SSD drive is nice.  Just the graphic is not very impressive compared with Google, Samsung, and Apple tablets.After a week of using the Surface Pro, I figured out the battery drain was coming from the blue tooth and the wireless functions of the devices.  After I turned off the blue tooth and the wireless functions of the devices, the battery power icon shows the battery power 8 hours left, 3 hours more than the specification rated 5 hours power rating.  So, turn down the brightness and turn off the blue tooth would prolong the battery service time .
The battery shipped out fast in a nice packed box.  It fits right into the battery slot of the FiOS box and no more beep sound.  Just don't know how long will it last....2 years, 3 years, or more.  Just the life of the lead and acid battery under $20 with free shipping. It does its function .
love MGK!!!!his lyrics are very relatable. a lot of cussing, but that doesn't bother me. i wouldn't suggest letting little kids listening to it .
The quality is great. I expect it to last a long time and it will not go out of style .
Sucks it looks like scrap metal they got and added decorations and no direction on how to assemble plaque. Don't buy only handle on one side kind of sharp .
Good read if not slightly predictable. The author drew a great picture of a small town anyone would want to live in .
I order this underwear in medium, not only did I have to call several times because they took over a month to arrive, but they all were different sizes!! the tags said "medium" but the underwear are all different sizes. I mean actual different lengths and all .
I am from singapore and had it shipped from the US (coz they don't sell it here). I like it because it is very stylish and useful.The bad side is that it easily condenses when i shower with it. Apparently it is not waterproof, even if they say it is.Then one day it just stopped working. When it is plugged in the usb, it says fully charged, but when i unplug it, the screen just dies. i bought my dad the same watch, and the same thing happend! had this watch for only 5 months.There is no service centre here in singapore to return this to. I have emailed nike support twice and never had a reply from them. 300 dollars wasted .
If I could I would give this jacket 10+ stars!First of all, I looked at many jackets on-line and knew this was for me.Love the color, the fit, the WARMTH and all of the technical features!Went skiing on an extremely windy day, was sitting on a ski lift and the person I was with was saying how he could feel the cold air through his jacket...I did not feel the wind through this jacket and stayed warm the whole time.Love the ski pass pocket at the wrist, the thumb hole to keep my wrists warm, the removable hood, etc....Light weight and thin, not bulky.I've gotten compliments the few times I've warn it.I highly recommend this jacket, can't say enough good things about it .
grandson big fan of anything ninja. wanted to give him a ninja movie appropriate for kids that wasn't a cartoon. this fit the biil .
the variety of games makes it appealing and unique. could not be found in local stores so it is a great find and at a good price .
grand-daughter is a huge fan and loves anything by her. this was no exception. great find and at a good price .
grandson loves Elmo so this was a big hit with him.  educational but so much fun.  not found in local stores so a great find .
this game has many levels and will be challenging at points but the boosts in the game really help you out. every 100 coins you colect you get mega points for free so you can unlock other characters to play with. as you collect coins you bounce up but beware after you pass coins up even if you didn't hit them they will disapear same with the powerups. this is practicallly the best free game you can download,it wont charge you, its fun,and its a great game  for children and adults. thank you .
They're a bit flimsy but for $5 I didn't expect them to be professional quality. They also have almost no shape to them but of course that can be done with the acrylic. Also they were a lot longer than I thought they would be. Overall they did what they were supposed to but I wouldn't recommend them to a beginner. It'll be more hassle than you'd hope for .
This book is simply wonderful. As far as the stories it contains are concerned, I have absolutely no complaints. Lovecraft's vocabulary is something to behold, providing even the most learned readers with at least a few unfamiliar words. Lovecraft has a skill not just for storytelling, but also for setting up a dark and frightening atmosphere for his stories. Anyone who is unfamiliar with Lovecraft's work ought to pick this item up; it serves as a nice sample of the kinds of works that Lovecraft is known for, and it will take quite some time to get through the entire 800 pages so one gets his/her money's worth for sure. The only reason that this item does not get a full five stars from me is that while the contents of the book are phenomenal (though appear to have been edited by a Brit due to spelling variations), the book itself physically leaves much to be desired. The ink of the text tends to smear if one has sweaty hands; further, the ink on the outside cover fades away too if one's hands sweat profusely. The book is also gigantic. To purchase this item is to purchase not only a source of entertainment but also a source of security; this book is big enough to be brandished as a weapon. Lastly, as one reaches the end of the book, the spine begins to bow in and the sound of the cheap glue holding the whole thing together can be heard crepitating with each turn of the page. Who said that we bookish types neglected our work-outs? This book's unwieldy size will more than make up for any missed weights training. So, purchase this book; I highly recommend it. But do take care to prepare both your brain and your biceps for this daunting and thoroughly satisfying tome .
Of course, one would expect it to work perfectly since it was never opened. After having played this, I now understand why this was such a popular Halo .
Despite what the other reviewers have said, this product is durable. Now, I would not try to stop a car with them, but they seem durable enough for plastic. The lenses are a little bit of a pain to clean. If you get a smudge on them, be prepared to wipe the lens for five minutes. Other than that, these are great .
I have been doing research on cassette-auxiliary cord adapters for quite a while, and the number of good reviews are often matched or surpassed by the number of bad reviews. Given this fact, I purchased this device without high expectations; however, upon first using this product, I was significantly shocked by its quality. It took my cassette deck a view tries to learn to not spit the faux tape out before being told to, but once my player grew accustomed to having the cassette door slightly ajar, that was no longer an issue (and upon reading the instructions provided with the device, this is apparently a normal symptom of first use). As far as the sound quality complaints that the reviews of some of these types of devices seem rife with, this device is obviously not going to have as high of sound quality as, say, a set of classy (and pricey) headphones; but in my opinion, the sound quality of this device is high enough to get the job done. I would highly recommend this product to anyone who has only a cassette deck to work with in his car and is in need of some modern tunes .
This item worked just fine for my friend; I have nothing to complain about. This did what it was supposed to do .
The game works perfectly, and I have no complaints at all. This game is awesome by the way for those of you who are not sure if you want to play it .
I'm amazed that this knowledge is not put out far the public to compare to other books such as the Bible.  Not quite as good as the first book "The Twelfth Planet " but very interesting .
I thought it was good book. Anything with Tesla in it is a plus even if it is fiction. The book shows that we should not mess with the past .
The story held my interest very well. It is a story that you could hear on CNN, without all the details. Things that we know existed, just don't vanish into thin air somebody knows something about it .
It is good to have a book that connect all of the dots. The book shows that they all had reasons for killing Kennedy and they would kill again to keep there secret. It sad to think that our nation has not changed that much .
I really love Logan Lerman as an actor, and I hope to someday get to meet him. This book seemed very stalker-ish, and if you want to meet someone, you shouldn't already know everything about them. Therefore I did not get, or read it.I did enjoy seeing his picture on the front of it though .
My friend had this case and I fell in love with it so, I ordered one too. I have only one complaint, the shipping speed. It takes a very long time for these to come in at standard shipping speed and there was no other speed to select. I haven't received my case yet, but I know I will love it .
It works great I take it when I'm on the go everywhere no problem with this item at all happy .
my bf had been buggin me to get him these cartridges and by the time they got yo him the exploded in his hand near his brothers eyes!!! i seriously do not reccommend this brand i couldn't even get my money back .
It workes perfectlly and I don't regret buying it, you should buy it if you need one  bexause it works .
This book was amazing, the love the drama just couldn't put it down. A must read for sure! Amazingly amazing .
I love this ring my fianc&eacute; and I have infinity signs tattooed so this was a great idea for an ingagemrbt ring. I'm not into the big rings like other women I love this ring and what it stands for !  Not too flashy just perfect .
Cute but not durable at all can't plug my speaker USB into it with the case on plus it broke while I was trying to take it off .
The Bad Seed is a classic suspense horror film in many ways.  It is packed with good theatrical acting. The suspense leads you toa surprising conclusion. It also ponders whether bad evil traits are inherited and not a learned environment. Overall rate this film six stars .
It doesn't even keep my phone charged,waste of my money . I'm so annoyed by the fact I thought I was investing in a good quality product .
It's just incredible how exciting it is to read this book, with every page it takes you into the story and you feel like you cannot stop reading, I would reed this book millions of times without getting tired .
You can't imagine how funny that book is, Ellen makes her life experiences a hilarious adventure!! Ellen is a great humorist .
I purchased this item because a friend of mine had one and he never run out of battery, so I decided to get one for my self and now I see how useful it is. This portable charger lets me charge my phone fully around five times before I have to charge it again. GREAT .
It doesn't look like an original Real Madrid shirt, it doesn't t even look like a sport shirt. 5 out 10 from me .
It's a piece of crap case it's not even a case really and  poor quality threw it out as soon as I received it in the mail .
I had the same issues as Indian Joe. We bought two for an Army Sniper Program and had the 1st set go down in a few months (eats batteries) The 2nd pair went bad about a yr later. We sent them back for repair and leupold sent two new sets. Again 1 set went bad within a yr. They have good glass and work well in low light, but are not reliable and will eat the batteries the same day you put them in...We tried several types of batteries with the same results .
Not her usual spellbinding novel.  So many characters, so little character definition.  Needed insightful editing.  Lyndley's grief is a bit overdone - no I.D .
Poorly conceived and totally unlike the Facebook app.  No directions on how to play.  Totally different format.  This is a waste of money or coins .
Pros: Sturdy, gorgeous, relatively well builtCons: Short cord on the USB hubThe cord doesn't quite reach my PC from where the stand sits on my desk, but I used it to lift my 24&#34; monitor and it leaves plenty of room for me to slide my keyboard underneath when I need to do some work with pencil and paper .
Kept me reading at a fast pace!well worth the time and money,you won't be dissappointed.I'll be looking for more of her books .
It's really work. My eyelash is getting longer everyday.Also good price, I don't want to buy expensive eyelash serum .
Good size, not too short, not too long.Easy to wash, I like it very much.I will get more .
It's been a long time since I have been engrossed in a series of books to the point of I can now officially say I am hooked on Mike Gage Thrillers. I can't wait to see what is next for the detective.  I stopped reading books for a long while due to the explosion of the internet but William Davis has written something that has me excited again about reading books .
So Wayne Dyer calls himself &#34;Doctor&#34;I am Deaf so I can not understand the movie: The Shift.Because the DVD has no Subtitles!So the movie is useless!Dyer did not consider the needs of Deaf people!1 Star for this!I hope that Wayne Dyer reads this review .
It wasn't really that great of quality. Was just a sticker stuck onto a case. Was hoping for more.  The case its self is made nice, but didn't realize the jack daniels was just a sticker .
We have a 7 month old male Cane Corso that weighs 80+lbs and has never ending energy! He is such a powerful puller that his nickname is "sled dog" because he's like an entire dog team by himself. He took right to running on this leash and I found out that I hardly had to pedal. He pulled me at speeds in excess of 20 mph and enjoyed every minute of it! This is the best product ever for exercising an energetic dog .
I recently purchased the H&K entourage mini fully automatic. What a true surprize. The knife is extremely solid, well balanced, light, and sharp as a scalpel out of the box. Overall length is only 3.75 and the blade is 2.75. What a knife in a small package! Sits low in your pocket so it's hardly at all visible. By far the best little pocket knife I've ever bought and made in the USA. Unfortunately shortly after I purchased mine I looked again for a gift and I cannot find one. I can only find the reguler " entourage " which is almost 2 inches larger.Hopefully it was my mistakes that couldn't find it because I would reccommend this knife to anyone. Military grade all the way .
This book is very simple and by no means earth shattering. There are a few gems but mainly a reflective collection of thoughts .
I enjoyed the book, Godess: The Secret Lives of Marilyn, but it didn't answer some of my questions about Marilyn. I assume that there are a lot of questions about her that will never be answered.  I did think the things revealed in this book were interesting, and helped me to understand Marilyn a little better. She will always reign as &#34;The Goddess of mystery&#34 .
I'v never been to another planet but UFO's on the moon made the experience real. The pictures were a little fuzzy but you get a simple but profound idea of how it is living on another planet.It leaves you with a better understanding of your own world. Fantastic Book .
I want to take an Oregon vacation like Helen's. I want to meet the people Helen met. I want to experience what Helen did. (Well most of it, not the bad stuff.) I was on page 26 when I realized I was hooked on this novel. Helen's reaction to the "inappropriate" situation at the resort was perfect, a perfect balance of fear and excitement, a famous minister's wife struggling with doubts and temptations. And Greta, strutting and fretting her hour upon the stage, resonated with my own life. And Sam, so vulnerable with his imperfections and his obsessions, was fascinating because, as much as he denied it, destiny did seem to be working in his life. The author kept going deeper into the character's lives, revealing more with each page, yet always building the tension toward the surprise ending. Nine Days was a complex story with a lot of layers, vivid descriptions and plot twists, yet it was so easy to read. It was just what this Illinois art teacher needed to read on a snow day! And I was touched, absolutely touched, by the ending .
Will not attach to camera needs an adapter and can not find it. Says it is for the Olympus 300 E-volt but does not work with it .
I bought two, and both of them don't work. One of them the LED light doesn't work. The other one the window punch doesn't work. I wanted to return the item, but I am not in the US, I found the shipment cost more than the money i spent on these two item. I feel so disappointed and angry about this. What kind of quality .
THE MATTRESS IS COMFORTABLE AND LIGHT. ITS SMELL IS NOT GOOD AT THE FIRST THREE DAYS BUT THAN THE SMELL IS ALMOST IMPERCEPTABLE. THE DELIVERY IS QUICK .
The book is just amazing, the story is realistic not only in the war aspect, but in th relation betel seen art and his father, the art is detailed yet cartoonish, easy to digest and a great way to tell the story .
I got the first generation Syncro shaver cleaning systems when they first came out. I am glad the refill cartridges are the same for the second generation systems. The second generation systems are intelligent enough to automatically decide how intense a cleanning session your shaver needs. I think this also helps conserve the amount of cleaning fluid is used. Another way to make it last longer is not to clean your shaver after every use, but rather just once or twice a week. In between cleanings, or before extended absences, I pull out the refill cartridge and seal it to keep the fluid from evaporating while it is just sitting there. So make sure to save the cap so that you can reseal the cartridge .
They say that they are bikini sized, but really, they are enormous. They are not bikini sized. I couldn't wear them at all. I got a size small, and I wear a size 5 in pants, and they were wayyyy too big. They should let you know that they are not the same underwear that is pictured on the model .
I ordered these to sculpt polymer clay and they arrived today. I was not expecting much from them, considering the price, and I was right to be skeptical. At least 7 of the tools in my set have small black pock marks or other visible signs of wear .
It's OK! It looks cool,and the price is right.It makes a good back up.It wouldn't be the first knife I grabe to defend my self with.It is sharp,and it has the chime to it.That means it was hardend right.The sheath is cheap .
Size Do not match. I spent a lot of money. And I did not receive. A good product.I'm not satisfied .
I recieved my windscreens all the way from the prc according to the tracking info.They showed up in abubble envelope and looked lliked 5 little wontons ready for the soup. Totally smashed.i wWould return them but Idont speak chinese..Illhave to get creative with this mess. W-hat a lousy vendor Unhappy in colorado.Who is Elife style.It should be Ejunkstyle .
I bought these from Target just to try and loved them. They are so comfortable and I went back to get more but they were out. I am so happy to have found them here! They give great coverage without riding up constantly. I am so tired of the underwear at Victoria's Secret not covering what they are meant to cover .
These screens fit perfectly and remove easily. Good conductivity through the screen using fingers or stylus. No glare in sun .
These are definateily worth having. The colors are cool for any seasona and the designs are pretty. The feel is comfortable - especially if you like walking around the home in undies. Its not an exaggeration to say they DO Run a bit small. These are opposite from the fruit of the looms which run big. The briefs are a bit low at the back too - which makes it ideal for low back outfits .
This battery is GREAT. My phone HD7 is mainly a gaming and music device, as I no longer have phone service to it (switched carriers and got a new phone earlier this year), so the size of the battery does not both me what-so-ever. I get tons of heavy usage time out of it, especially if I turn on battery saving mode (tested at 24+ hours of just playing music) and will provide DAYS of stand-by time. The only issue I had with the fitment of the new back cover is it sticks up a tiny bit (less than a millimeter) in the upper left hand corner, but I definitely can't feel it, and never notice it until I look really closely. Highly recommended .
Excellent hardware, expendable sd card slot, IR blaster, fast response, wonderful UI becuase of the best OS - Android, millions of usefull apps, majority of them are free, yes FREE!! This second generation tablet is better than the first generation, but the price is much lower than that! Do not look at crappy Ipad (whatever generation) stuff. Compare to this tablet, ipad tablet are inferior products but charge outragous price! save your some money for some useful apps, books, etc .
Don't buy this coffee maker! I had one for about 4 months and then I woke up to boiling coffee and smoke everywhere. The coffee pot had caught fire on the inside! I called Cuisinart and the customer service was great. I had a replacement in a day. Now, a year later, this one caught on fire! Avoid this model at all cost .
So many twist and turns that you don't really ever see what's coming next but it's always as it should be and the ending doesn't leave you hanging like the majority of them do I should definitely recommend this book although the slang in which so much of it is written is at times hard to follow it is well worth it .
Well written even if a bit hard to understand do to the yorkshire accent that parts of it are written in but very inspiring and uplifting to see Colin and Mary not only growing physically but spiritually and emotionally as well definently a book that should be not only read but studied as well as there are many things to be taken from it .
Fast paced bookVery erotic story lineHard warmingShows love has no boundsWanted more of the storyHope to read more .
very very exciting story line I found it very hard to put it down I can't wait to read more .
I would recommend this book to all my friends.A strong young woman making her life better.I was so obsessed I couldn't stop reading. The story was so detailed and heart wrenching I had hard time putting book away .
I love how I couldn't put book downVery exciting storyI laughed, cried, through whole bookLiked the story line very muchTwo people could love so much yet be afraid to show it to each other .
This book I could not put downI cried n laughed smiledI felt so connected reading this bookThe author really brought this story to lifeThe way this story end really brings home how people can really truely love someone can concore there past .
Awesome bookVery heart felt storyI couldn't put book down once I started it.Love happy endings. Great book .
Very interesting story couldn't put it down once i started it. can wait read more about these events. t y .
I bought this for my wife.  She had seen it before and liked it.  I had never seen it, but was very familiar with much of the music.  I loved the music, but was bored with every other aspect of the story .
These are great &#34;looking&#34; chairs.  We bought two for our children's (5 and 3yrs) playroom.  Honestly the backs are a little low for them and my son the 5 yr old doesn't think they are too comfortable but not much out there is .
Every time I go to IHOP I order the Swedish crepes with lingonberry butter.  Now I can stay home and have this whenever I want.  Yummy .
Nice thick soft leather, not orange liner like the pic but big deal! I wear a L / XL t-shirt so I got the XL vest fits good got it for 38.00 bucks open box buy. Can't beat that .
I didn't want to pay 70.00 for stock latch covers and also didn't see any aftermarket covers that caught my eye. The plastic chrome covers did the trick and saved me some $$ until I find the latch cover for me. They work just fine and you can't tell that they are not metal. Good buy .
It doesn't fit with my Xbox. I need to return it. It was not marked clearly exactly which system this fit .
Chevelle never fails to amaze me. The best band in rock!!! They keep moving forward and progressing with each album they put out .
Was on a huting trip this past weekend, it got pretty cold at night times. I had a thermal underneath and it felt like I was ove heating I got so hot. I gave it a 4 because what I reccieved wasn't what was shown in th pitcure, the cuffs weren't gray nor was he waist part. Also what really made me sad was there were no buttons in the front .
Along with everyone else these pants were alot bigger then I expected, not a big deal. My problem is that The treestand pattern is different then my long sleeve. These are overall a god set of pants .
I like the support and that it isn't made of cheap plastic, but it did not fit snugg on my Gamo bigcat 1250. I will adjust it to my gun, but not the fit is the only reason why I rated this a 3 .
Very sharp knife out of the box, not in favor in the shoulder sheath I will probably not use it, but overall a verygood product .
Easy to order, easy to operate. Even though it did not come directly from Amazon, the deal went smoothly, I got my product, rock-n-roll .
I randomly came across this book in the Amazon bookstore. I thought it looked interesting and gave it a shot.It was well worth the investment! ( which wasn't much btw )I have been wanting to find ways to free myself from stressing about the 9-5, and I want more time with my family. This book has inspired me and given me the ideas that I think can help me reach that goal.Let the journey begin .
I have tried 5 cases for my straight talk samsung galaxy sII and this one is definitely the best I've had. I already had a screen protector on my phone so if that is something you are concerned about I can't help you there, but the case is awesome. I say skip all those cases from $5 - $10 just spend a couple of extra bucks and get the right case the first time .
I love thease battery because I can record  longer time without using  ac/dc powerI did not open but when I use this battery in future I will sure review again .
It is smaller than what I expected, Not a full size dish rack that we were expecting, Good for a compact place .
The disintegration of Futh's marriage at first seems like just another very sad statistic in matrimony, until we see that it's perhaps Futh's slightly simple nature, social clumsiness and 'round peg in a square hole' temperament which may have contributed. As the character is built, his clumsiness becomes very plausible and when combined with the constant awareness which haunts him of his own mother's leaving his father, I couldn't help feeling as weighted down as he must have been by a cruel fate - if not cruel genes.On flashback to his ambles through Germany with his father, soon after the splitting of his parents, all he has to cling to of his mother through to his rather humdrum middle age is the model lighthouse she gave him as a child, a perfume container, which he hopes may one day give him a glimpse of better luck in his life.For me it was the way life still cheated him, the way early embitterments in life can cast a permanent cloud over any future, that made me sympathise so deeply with Futh. However, the tone of the book is often so interminably loaded with cloud that the cumulative effect is almost depressing. Perhaps this is the success of the book but, to an extent, that success eluded me .
The style took me a chapter or two to catch as almost every word seems to go toward painting a picture of scene or character to create a sense of menace around the corner - whether the corner be of the college corridor or one of the neon lit back streets in those deprivation-hardened places of which London isn't so proud.This said, the storyline lived up to its promise. I was drawn to the character of the the gentle teacher who is humiliated by those who mentally trample him under foot instead of listening to his teaching on the metaphysical poets. From the start, even though Matt Kreasey's paranoia seems at first a little unfounded because you don't know whether his demons or class tormentors really are intending to harm him, still the tenderness of Kreasey's feelings for his young student, Amy, were raw and effective.Amy becomes her teacher's only ally when he has to confront the pack of wolves who are his students. Yet the tenderness and the promise even of love is so often strained by the lingering air of menace which runs through this book.The writing rises at times to poetry and descends where it needs, to street slang. To begin with, something of a slow burner but the characters guarantee this to be engaging until the poignant ending .
Trying to get it prescribed to so I won't have to wear contacts with them but love it . Ordering again .
Beautiful colors . Can't wait to start using them!!!  Palette is small which I really like and the colors are pigmented .
Love it for my mini and it cute . The only think is that it not as secure as I wished it was .
I chose the number 5 stars because this product was worth every penny. It's very good in your pockets, fits easy, and it does what its name is. It's &#34;LifeProof&#34; I tested it in water (didn't break) same with shock. I would recommend this to anyone because it's totally worth it .
I chose 3 stars because it's good but the charging cover sometimes gets in the way. It sometimes doesn't fit in the slot. It also is pretty heavy but you would expect it from a case like that .
Im thinking Im going to ger this protector, slap it on and be done with it not. When I put it on I could get the air bubbles out of it for anything. Its on my galaxy tab 2 but not smooth at all. Its protects it but it looks a hot mess on my tab bc of all the air bubbles everywhere .
I really loved this book. I am so happy that she dropped that loser. He wasn't worth one of the tears she cried .
This storyline is off the chain. I always love to hear about dudes and how they handle their many women, all I can say is his must be platinum coated. I don't have the mind or heart to handle all his dirt .
I loved this book!! I'm not so sure these steamy scenes should be legal. Lol Will have to read again to be sure .
Oh I can't wait for the next book. I was really mad about the ending but it did it's job I will be getting the next one asap .
Awesome shoes, fit my boyfriend great after we followed the shoe size chart and measured his foot with a ruler. Wares them all the time shows no sign of ware or tear however they are becoming a little stinky after waring them in Lake Eerie .
I was excited by this costume as its value for money and resemblance to the real thing are great! Another reason i bought it is that rather than the usual skin tight morph suit type fit alot of these costumes have this one has a slightly looser fit as to not scare off those you meet with your genitalia! My only criticisms of the suit are firstly the oversized upper body. I am 5'11 in height and with this suit on i was almost as wide! My shoulders became around 4ft wide due to the poor fit of the chest piece and the overly padded upper arm muscles which actually looked like oddly placed breast implants somewhere around my shoulders! My only other complaint was the poor quality velcro attachments on the back to close the suit, it was coming undone with the slightest movements, although slight movements were all you could do anyway with the restricting foam muscles .
This is a modest affair but it was free so I will cut the story some slack. The science is pretty good but not too much. The plot is, well, basic but good enough to finish .
A golden age classic for free. Not sure how long this offer is on so grab it now. Good conversion job on the file and a fun story .
This is a very simple sci-fi story that has been told many times before. The big difference here is the attempt the author makes to keep the science reasonably real. The engines, guns and gravity all work as they should. The characters are a little cliche but that doesn't stop the fun .
There are no real surprises here. This is an indie space opera with a sound science underpinning and some great action. It isn't the greatest but it kept me occupied for a few nights and I'll defintiely get book no 2 .
This three book set contains three novels, each one ranging between 60-70k words. The stories are mainly about Spartan, the classic hard as nails hero that works his way up the ranks. Not particularly original yet the universe is detailed and filled with worlds, ships and people .
good quality with made in china. Come very quick. Unfortu there is no shaver bag included. Good stuff. worth that money .
I devoured this book in under thirty-six hours, and it probably wouldn't have taken that long, except I had to keep stopping to chase down friends and partners and read them excerpts.  I was really struck by how varied the writers were.  The narratives run the full range of love, hatred and indifference for the sex trades, but also in age, niche, gender and writing style.  I think, for a sex worker or former sex worker, there will be many moments of laughing and/or cringing in recognition, but the stories are still massively accessible for allies or folks who aren't familiar with sex work politics at all.  I'll definitely be recommending it to everyone I know (but not loaning it out, because I'm sure someone would just *keep* it, it's that good .
I initially bought these because they were so cheap and i needed some reassurance that i was ovulating. After a couple months of negative pregnancy tests, i figured these wouldn't hurt. I started using the OV tests 10 days after my period started and got a very obvious negative. I used one each day, and on day 15 i saw a slightly darker line than i had been seeing. And on day 16, it was a very obvious positive that i would be ovulating soon (the two lines were the same color). This shocked me because I've been using an app to track my period for almost a year (my average cycle was 34 days). it turns out I was actually ovulating 6 days before the app predicted (so we were COMPLETELY missing our window the previous months!) When i saw the positive OV test we got busy right away! And 12 DPO, i decided to use one of the HCG tests and there was the tiniest faint line (i knew this was pretty early to test but i couldn't help!). So i waited a couple more days and took another one and it was definitely darker but still pretty light, but even a faint line only means one thing: you're pregnant! I took a digital test just to confirm because i needed all the confirmation i could get... and the digital test in fact showed the same thing: PREGNANT.I've been using up the rest of my HCG tests everyday and the line has gotten darker everyday as the HCG levels have gone up. These tests proved to be so helpful!! They are seriously so easy to use and easy to read. I would highly recommend them and not try to conceive based off an app .
I think its cool (until it brakes) for me i used it for 2 days then the lock started failing and now  the lock won't shut and the slide to lock and unlock thing doesn't work to great and what do you expect for like $2.50? Only good thing about it is fast shipping. If i were any of you reading my review and deciding weather to get it or not i wouldn't if you do you get what you pay for .
WARNING: this is a 3 piece sticker (the head shape and 2 eyes or eye brows). Over all its ok just be careful when putting it together or it won't look right .
If you haven't seen this movie you're really missing out its really funny and different its really a must see .
I didn't really care for it the bad guy and his creepy horses really creeped me out i wouldn't recommend this  movie to anyone .
So i got this when i had a 3g and i loved it and it was awesome. Now i have a I-phone 4 and i bought this for my new 4 and it shipped and got here in like 2 days that was awesome. I put it on and the top right corner comes off a little and then the whole thing falls apart. So i give it 2 stars for super fast shipping and delivery. so over all i wouldn't recommend this for anyone unless you want a broken case .
Its kinda stupid didn't really care for it all that much. Its a movie for ages from 5-10 so yeah a ok movie .
Awesome novel. I was kind of unsure when i read the synopsis, but I'm glad i got it. Hey it while it's free. It's not a spot religious book like some others. It's very good and anyone can enjoy it .
All of G.P. Ching's books are awesome. Never a waste of money or time. She is a wonderful writer that is by far one of the most creative people. Just when you think you know what's going on, Woah! Plot twist! Lol i definitely recommend reading the first book in the soulkeepers series before engaging in the other novels .
This game was cute for a little girl. I personally liked how you had to pay attention to what was going on and stay on top of it, it wasn't easy, but it was possible to complete and made you think about if running a supermarket is really this hard .
I enjoy the game, but there are no levels or advancements. it's simple and its a nice waiting game but as far as creativity and scoring and fun is concerned it doesn't really fulfill my needs .
I didn't enjoy this app so much. I was hoping for a fun free app to complete puzzles with, but instead i got a slow app that doesn't even work .
I love phase ten. I just wish i could pay the whole game, but the free version is pretty nice. The phases don't go in order though and most of the time you will lose, however it's a fun way to spend spare time or if you're a new player, to learn  the game .
I love puzzles and trying to figure things out. I loved this game and i literally could not put down my kindle when i was playing it. I recommend it for anybody that likes brain teasers and fun puzzles .
I love escape games, but i admit this one has me stumped a couple times. This cheat guide helped me a lot through ones that i did not understand. It was very thorough, step by step, and successful .
This game was very different than any other game, i have nothing to compare it to. However, it was fun to play and made me think very hard about my next move. I recommend this for people that have free time and don't mind thinking a little when they play games .
Not completely a waste, they had a good idea, but they need to add more to it. So far you could only feed the baby and put it to sleep. Occasionally make it laugh. Nothing else. It would be nice to change diapers or give it a bath etc .
I was disappointed because on the beginning of my purchase i thought there would be a plot similar to that of the movie or maybe some extra puzzles or outside the box thinking to be necessary but this game is just like bejeweled and it was a waste. It did however go back and forth from the movie but the game has nothing to do with it .
Not all bad, but not very good either. You pay games to win bottles and feed the baby. You give it a shower and there are levels but it's the same thing for each level. There are 3 functions only. Feeding him, bathing him and putting him to sleep .
I got this game with my sister in mind and she loves it. There are so many different games to play in Dr. Panda's airport that your child will never get bored .
I ordered 25 for a party and  I was surprised at the quality. Very nice, just the right size to set on the table, tongs are not flimsy, grasps ice cubes perfectly. Everyone admired them and took them home as a &#34;party token&#34; I recommend them, very pleased .
You will enjoy Shawn Cleary sixth sense as she catches one of two twins.Can't wait to read the last of The Cleary Case Files .
I have a medium size cat and there needs to be a bit more space for her to move around inside the carrier. I leave the top mesh open and attach a harness so she can't jump out but she can climb on top and sit on my shoulder and the top of the carrier which she prefers .
I do not like how the words are so large that they take up a whole page.  What a waist of paper .
This cage is large and easy to use.  There are green latches at the bottom so you can simply detach and clean out the poop/pebbles.  Does NOT come with wheels or rollers.  My ferret loves her cage and cleaning is a snap .
I expected really poor light quality.  This is better than I expected for the price.  Still can't say how it will hold up over time .
Even though it was only $.99 it broke not even after having it open for 5 mins. Its cute but a waste of money .
Good easy game. I play it when im not busy to pass the time and make my daily poops fly by .
This would have been great if I had brows to apply this product to.  I have very little hair on my brow and it doesn't apply on bare skin properly.  Color was very very light.  I ordered blonde.  I'm going to have them tatooed on, once and for all, or I will just keep using my Maybelline pencil, which I have done for years.  I always try new products for my brows, but I guess the only true fix will be having a hair transplant (LOL) or a tatoo.  Sparce brows have haunted me since my teenage years, and to make matters worse, I am very blonde and fair .
This is a beautiful bag.  It is extremely well made.  Soft, soft classy leather and the inside is just as beautiful.  I could not be more happy.  I stole this bag at this price.  Had seen this maker in the stores, but never, never could have afforded this line. I did take the short strap off, because I don't like short handled purses, and had to have the shoulder strap shortened, all for $5.00 at the local shoe repair, small price to pay for such a beautiful, beautiful bag. Nice compartments inside with plenty of room for all your needs.The shipment arrived on time, packed nicely and I could not be more pleased with the service or the merchandise .
Best oral care on the market.  Never used a product like this before.  I love it.  A bit expensive, but well worth the price.  Great investment.  If this on wears out, I WILL replace with another.  Best thing I ever bought .
I waited in anticipation for this author's latest book, the continuing story of the Seabrook Family. I was not disappointed! The characters came to life and I felt their passion and love for one another. The story had it all, love, intrigue and a fascinating view of The Regency time period .
We have used to old style neck bone pillow for over 10 years. The old ones are sewed shut and the filling can not be adjusted with out cutting a seam.  The new one has a zipper so you can change the how firm or soft you wish the pillow to be.  This is an item that we would recommend .
I have had no problems with these sticking in the charger, as reported by another customer. There has been no problems with the batteries hold a charge or working correctly in my camera.  Sure beats the local Batteries Plus (39.95 for 1 battery .
I wzs wanting to replace my lost christmas tree bulbs with the same type, but I can not find them.  This selection allowed me to put some birds in the open holes. This item was also shared with my daughter who was missing some of her plastic light bulbs.I had spent time driving around and looking for replacement bulbs and should have bought on line and saved my gas .
I already owned a C740 and was able to buy a used C750 at an estate sale. The 750 did not have an adapter tube to protect the lense, so I needed to buy one.  The one I found on line was what I was looking for.  The shipping time from the company to my mail box was what I expected. The quality of the  adapter tube is above what I expected .
I used these on my Olmpus C750 with an extension tube. I was able to get great results even with the close-up lens not attached directly to my camera lens. I am a very happy customer. Shipping time was good (I had chosen the slow way). A good company to do business with, give them a try .
The list of products that this kit fit did not list my Olympus C750, so I decided to take a chance. The price was right compared to Walmart which charged $19.96 for two filters. Everything fit my 52mm extension tube with no problem. I would recommend this for anyone to try on their 52mm lens. The company shipped quickly and I had chosen the slow way. Good quality and excellent service, give them a try .
This is a GREAT book I started reading it on wattpadd LOVED it then it didn't finish the story I had to get the book .
A must for your tablet weather your a kid or an adult. You will have so much fun you will not want to put it down. Warning you will get hungry while playing this game .
This is a fantastic coming back to form CD. Out goes Tate and in comes Latorre like a bat out of hell to not only fill the roll of vocalist but to makes us forget very quickly who the vocalist was before him. All the song are great on this CD at 35 minutes you get kicked in the balls. Each song hits you in a different way. They have come back to there roots and do it spectacularly. This should be CD of the year .
Should I worry... I'm 44 years old and I really have fun with this app! Love cats but can't have one be cause both my kids are allergic to them. So I guess this is the next best thing .
I like it's convenience but the unit I got is not flat it has a serious bow in the center of the table.I think the cup holder has a weakening effect on it's edge or maybe it happened during shipping .
Just received the Leather Tokarev Holster in the mail and I am very satisfied with the quality and fit of this product.  Plus, even though this holster appears to have been designed to fit your typical Russian Tokarev pistol, a Yugoslavian or Serbian Tokarev will also fit in spite of the fact that these have a slightly longer grip than a Russian Tokarev pistol.  I would not hesitate to order products from this vendor in the future .
this book is pretty good, although, I must say, the cover has nothing to do with the story at all... It just makes it look foolish to me .
I LOVE THIS GAME!!!!!!! It can keep me occupied for hours at a time!!! Also when i walk away from it, I hear fighting. I reccmend this game no matter how old you are .
I would not recommend this to ANYONE...unless you appreciate floating frosting.  It is annoying to make cupcakes with frosting that is not actually attached to the cupcake and instead floats above it.  I only like the selection of toppings.  I will be removing this application and not waste the space.  You may want to save your space and not bother playing this .
The puck never stops and the EASY level is pretty HARD.  This game stops a lot...and gets very annoying.  It is hard to get into this game because you know that it is going to freeze up and stop again.  I would not recommend this game because it is more aggrivating than fun .
There are a total of 10 games and if you get the FREE version then you only get to choose 3.  I think that you should have access to more.  These games seem a bit to easy for 1st graders.  It seems geared more towards my 3 year old sister and she really likes to play it, but it is too easy for my 6 year old sister.  I would recommend this to Kindergarden and under.  Probably not so bad if you actually purchase the full version.  Then you will have some more complicated work and actually help teach your children .
You would expect it to be similiar to Mario Brothers...However, your person does not move.  They just stand still to collect the fruit.  This game is EXTREMELY boring and I would not recommend this if you do not have much patience.  Do not waste the time or space in your device for this EXTREMELY boring game .
I am not much on the holiday remakes.  Although I really like the original.  I do not have the patience to keep uploading, just to delete shortly after I upload it.  The original and the holidays are basically the same, so if you enjoy changing things up all the time you will probably really like this.  But if you are more like me, the original is the BEST .
I hate having to change things up on my device every season, but i love the original. i would recomend this to older children...who can wait on things. Overall its fun, so if you like changing it up go ahead but if you don't let me give you some advice and space on your device. Either choose your favorate holiday and stick with it, or just stay with the original since they are all the the same. I love this game .
Hotel Dash is a really good game to play when you have any spare time during the day. It is fun and challenging for me and I'm only 10 years old.I recommend this game for ages 7 and up. My sisters are 3 and 6 years old. My 6 year old sister plays this game and its too challenging for her. I also recommend all of the PlayFirst games like Wedding Dash, Cooking Dash,etc if you enjoy this game.However, I can only afford to buy the free versions of these games and cannot buy the full version and all of the fun of the costly games. Please make full versions free. That is the only problem with these games. Other than that I really enjoy these challenging fun filled games. Get these games .
We are very surprise not only keep cool but  cold . It is large I Recommend it. The price is good .
Bought this hookah for a get together arrived early was packed very well no broken pieces looks amazing smokes very well very very well very detailed tileing on base would definitely buy another one A .
It is the best helmet I have ever had so far. The quality is exceptional. The padding on the inside is very soft and does not irritate your skin unlike the other helmets. The only downfall I have noticed is that the helmet is very sensitive to scratches, especially if you accidentally drop it or hit it against the  wall while carrying it around. Other than that, I highly recommend this helmet to anybody who is looking for a full-face helmet. I wear it during riding down the trails as well as an everyday head protection. You might get warm if your are sitting inside (who knows, you might like it so much), but overall ventilation is exceptional .
I love my Hemp Sanuks!  Great fit and very comfortable.  Hemp is such a versatile plant,  too bad people aren't educated about the many uses and health benefits.  EDUCATE yourselves on the subject .
I ordered this along with 3 other cases and this one came first, about a week and a half or so. I love it! It's the color in the picture and my friends think its cool because it looks like it's just a bumper. No real protection on the front of your phone though. I like it .
I cried many times while reading this touching story. Never could I have imagined such cruelty by people we are to trust .
Device works perfect. Excellent price. I've been using it for 3 weeks now, I haven't had any issues. I highly recommend this product .
Very heavy duty. It is very solid, it doesn't feel as though it would break easily.Presses garlic good, leaves some unpressed around the edges, but no more than other presses I've usedCleans easy which is a huge +Would recommend itI used to take 10 mins mincing up garlic really fine, but now I press it in 30s with the same (if not better) results .
it was fine, not coarse. and i though more would come with itit did its job bot i was not impressed my anything. i now use &#34;grostone&#34; made from recycled glass and it is a much batter option.but, received as described. decent, not great price, worked well .
It would be 5 stars but i don't know how well the product works yet. but so far so good. not leaf burn. and my babies look healthy.also excellent shipping times .
installed very easy, no leaks, clean waterhave been using a month and now it constantly drains water to waste, wasting a lot of waterand the ppm of the filtered water is 240ppm, almost the 275 it was before the filter. i just hope the chlorine is removed .
Works well. Great priceNo quality loss, but I wouldn't expect any from an hdmi cableWe used it in a RV to replace an old cable with a broken connectorIt's small head made it much easier to run than the old oneUsed it to connect a 47inch LCD TV to a PS3, and a DirecTV receiver. No Problems!Would recommend .
missing an alkaline filterhasnt been used yet but didn't come as described (even tho im sure 9-% of the time it does)would buy again, just cuz i have an ispring system .
I was not impressed.  it was not what I expected.  this was not for me, so please remove it from my device.  thank you .
The cover was bent when it arrived. It will latch on to one side of the phone, but sit apart from the other. I've tried placing it under a heavy book overnight to correct the bend and it didn't work. Total disappoint .
First off - who includes a TEN year warranty on a milligram scale??...American Weigh foes. Which is great, since I'm a slob and have dropped this scale numerous times, left residue on/around the plate for ages, and generally haven't treated this thing as I do most electronic devices I own. And it still has yet to break, malfunction or otherwise function improperly.I am astounded by the strength and quality of the materials, the packaging, the case, the ease-of-calibration, the consistent measurement accuracy and the low, low price.I used to own a milligram scale - the kind where you must place a glass box over the whole device and try not to breathe within twenty yards of it. This scale IS affected by magnetism, gravity and electronic signals, but not anywhere near the extent that a scale hundreds of dollars more expensive is, and yet I find this to be just as accurate!If you need a scale and are on a budget, look no further than this one. It's been amazing, a real pleasure to use. And being that I purchased it only a couple months ago, there is a long way to go before that warranty expires .
Purportedly, oleamide exerts some of its psychoactive effects by either directly or (more likely) indirectly modulating the behavior of the brain's CB1 receptor. Subjectively, I can attest that this is the feeling that Oleamide provided me in doses between 100 and 200mg.Oleamide's &#34;endocannabinoid&#34; presence can truly be *felt*. And by that, I mean exactly what I write - an oral dose of ~125mg produces sensations uncannily similar to the physiological response produced by Cannabis, whilst lacking the psychoactive &#34;high&#34; that direct agonization of the CB2 receptor would likely provide. Therefore, in mimicking the bodily sensations of Cannabis, Oleamide has true potential across a generous landscape of applications.At more moderate doses - I would say not more than 65-70mg - Oleamide proved an effective (although somewhat sluggish feeling) anxiolytic. This is important to me, as I am attempting to decrease the developed physiological dependency I have on benzodiazepine anxiolytic medications used to combat Generalized Anxiety Disorder.At doses ranging from 100mg-150mg, Oleamide again shone brightly as an effective anxiolytic, but with an added twist - it produced moderate painkilling properties. This is not to label Oleamide a &#34;narcotic&#34; in the true sense of the word. For me, however, it did produce a &#34;fuzzy&#34; feeling lingering throughout my body that dulled the aches and pains of a day's worth of work away. In a sense, it physiologically faded my awareness of the negative sensations into the background of my conscousness, which may be a welcome benefit to many a friend of mine who use alcohol on a daily basis for just the same purpose, but with far more detrimental effect.Lastly, at higher doses between 150mg and 200mg, Oleamide performed OUTSTANDINGLY in combatting my impaired sleep-onset insomnia! Doses between 125-150mg definitely made me tired and yawn, but doses above 150mg generally lulled me into a deep slumber that was not only restorative, but was sound and lasted an ample amount of time; I would generally sleep soundly for eight or nine hours, whereas six hours per night of sleep was a milestone I could only hope to achieve beforehand.The four-star rating reflects an inherent flaw in the relationship between Oleamide's pharmacology and my body's physiology - that being an inconsistent manifestation of the aforementioned effects. While Oleamide provided the intended results at the dosages specified above consistently enough that I felt they warranted mention, there have been numerous occasions where I would ingest a known dose of Oleamide only to be either disappointed by *no* effect, or overwhelmed by an *augmentation* of the desired effect. I recall one instance where 150mg had me completely out-of-it, drifting between hazy consciousness and deep sleep, for a sixteen hour period. For practical insomnia treatment forming a proper marriage with the rigors of everyday life, this is clearly a short-coming.Overall, this compound piqued my interest enough in the potential for endocannabinoids to be used for a wide variety of practical, semi-daily applications and have since ordered Stearamide to test its properties - both individual, and in conjunction with Oleamide, as was suggested by another reviewer.I do recommend giving this product a try; its cheap price, high quality, fast delivery and the fact that its effects are immediate and not cumulative make it a winner in my book. Other nootropics, whose effects are purported to be cumultative in nature (Noopept being one I can name off the top of my head) may work, and indeed I have found them to, but a lot of me remains concerned that the benefit I get from those types of nootropics may in some part be placebo. With nootropics like Oleamide, there is no question that what I am feeling is a direct result of ingesting the material.Be safe, and please always use an accurate milligram scale when dealing with near-pure nootropic crystals like these.~ Vaya .
I've read a number of studies on the efficacy of Inositol in treating mental health disorders, such as GAD and OCD.The dosages used in those studies ranged from between 12 and 18 grams per day, and so I began to take 16 grams daily divided into two 8 gram administrations - one in the morning and one in the early afternoon.I used to take gabapentin (Neurontin) off-label for Mood Disorder NOS. Essentially, I used Neurontin as a 'mood stabilizer.' And this effect, in fact, was strikingly similar to that produced by my a Inositol regimen. I must say that I was both surprised and pleased!Treatment with Inositol takes patience to feel palpable results, and yet when they *are* felt, the weeks endured suddenly appear to be fleeting fancies.To qualify myself, I definitely am feeling less.... Let's say, 'antsy' inside. I do not feel the urge to move about constantly to engage in meaningless tasks that later leave me tired and unmotivated. I have also noticed that I don't get as wrapped up in social exchanges as I used to. I am far more relaxed when I speak to others, which I feel has improved my communication skills.Inositol's effects appear, in my experience, to synergize well with those of Taurine, and I recommend their co-administration whole-heartedly.I am always impressed with LiftMode products' utility, portion, presentation, purity, shipping and communication, and Inositol did not part from this paradigm.I highly recommend it .
Baicalin is a substance that I sampled from LiftMode for the express purpose of reviewing. I had no prior knowledge of the substance, and went into it without expectation.The first thing that I noticed was that the recommended dosage produced negligible effects; I was advised by Mark & the LiftMode team that, to produce anxiolytic effects, users typically require 500-1,000mg of Baicalin. I found these estimates to be wholly accurate, and advise prospective users of this compound to try the same!At ~500-750mg, the anxiolytic effects were quite pronounced. I noticed a natural decrease in my respiration rate (not to be confused with respiratory depression, such as that resulting from opiate/opioid ingestion!), and those things that we come across in daily life - traffic jams, less-than-ideal interactions with those whom we love, et al., appeared to be experientially less disturbing than they might without the addition of Baicalin to my regimen.Therefore, in this reviewer's opinion and experience, Baicalin is indeed as effective an anxiolytic as it is purported to be. And, for one one (such as myself) with diagnosed Generalized Anxiety Disorder - who has concurrently become dependent on benzodiazepines as a result - finding a *natural* remedy against the &#34;everyday anxieties&#34; life cannot help but impose is truly appealing!For the chronic insomniacs out here, Baicalin has something to offer you, too.At a dosage of about 1 gram (1,000mg), the sleep-inducing qualities of Baicalin are - to put it mildly - profound. I am, in addition to being prescribed Valium for GAD - prescribed prohibitively high quantities of Restoril to combat chronic sleep-onset insomnia. I find that I no longer require nearly as much of this costly hypnotic in order to fall asleep when Baicalin is added - perhaps half a capsule of Restoril (as opposed to 1-2!) - and this, alone, is worth the price in my opinion.The 4-star rating is merely due to the *ever-so-slight* inconsistencies I have experienced from Baicalin dose-for-dose; however, if Amazon were to grant me the courtesy, I would give Baicalin 4 1/2 stars hands-down!For those seeking the benefits I have above described, please do consider Baicalin to our regiment.It is WELL worth the slight price tag.~ Vaya .
Whilst direct comparisons between Synephrine and Ephedrine are impossible, given the large number of viable pharmacological differences that various substitutions at Synephrine's phenethylamine backbone can produce, there are similarities.Synephrine possesses comparatively weak affinity for adregnergic receptors; specifically, a1 over a2. Its principle pharmacological effects are blood pressure elevation, constriction of peripheral blood vessels and dilation of the pupils.Oral doses following LiftMode's recommend guideline of one 50mg scoop produces very light stimulation; this 'lighter' stimulation, however, I find preferable to the stimulation brought about by experimentation with dosages over 100mg. Having taken ephedrine before, I find the effects to be qualitatively quite similar - but Synephrine's weaker affinity for the adrenergic receptors means that one has more liberty with dosage experimentation without the worry of inadvertently creating a hypertensive crisis situation. This is a HUGE plus for me, as my body reacts very differently to different adrenergic agonists and I have had little success in finding one that I felt comfortable experimenting with until I found Synephrine.Synephrine also possesses several qualities that make it superior to Yohimbine HCl and Hordenine for stimulation. With respect to Yohimbine HCl, potency is the main factor. Yohimbine HCl is very active at dosages as little as 2.5-5.4mg; 2.5mg is the recommended dosage, whereas administration of 5.4mg TID has been used in most scholarly reserach articles s the test dosage for treating erecticle dysfunction. Obviously, however, a milligram scale is of the *utmost* importance when dealing with that compound. Synephrine bypasses the absolute need for a scale, however; I have taken a flattened spoonful (the spoon included with LiftMode's jar) and weighed it, and it is indeed nearly 50mg on the nose. This makes dosing less nerve-wracking and less potentially-disastrous.Synephrine is HIGHLY preferable to Hordenine, too, because Hordenine also possesses weak MAOI-B properties and can thus potentially be dangerous when combined with other widespread materials that are contraindicated with universal MAOI's, as well as those particular to MAO-B. Aside from this, though, Synephrine's stimulation is much more managable than Hordenine's. My heart races less, I sweat less, and I experience less symptoms of cardiovascular fatigue than I do with Hordenine. Synephrine's effects are much more predictable in this sense, too.Synephrine itself provides a pleasant stimulatory state, and I have personally found that - depending on the occasion and need for intensity - doses of 50, 75 and 100mg are appropriate without feeling toxic. There is an amphetamine-like quality of inspiration that I find with Synephrine that is absent from compounds like Yohimbine and Hordenine, too, which I particularly like. If I need to fill out applications, perform menial work/chores, work out, and other tasks that I am prone to putting off or neglecting altogether, I find 75mg of Synephrine seems to naturally stimulate my desire to get done what I need to do.One con of Synephrine that I have found, and one which prevents me from granting it 5/5 stars here, is the pervasive feeling of fatigue that follows the initial effects. I tend to notice an extreme absence of energy about four hours after I have taken Synephrine - one that makes it difficult to re-engage myself in everyday activities such as work or social interaction without re-dosing. In addition to making me *feel* subjectively exhausted, the after-effects of Synephrine also make me *look* exhausted; I usually have noticable dark rings under my eyes, and am yawning constantly.All said and done, though, Synephrine appears - to me- to be quite the viable alternative to Ephedrine and Pseudoephedrine, and is one with palpable and reliable effects that simultaneously does not seem to tax my cardiovascular health as much as other stimulatory nootropics. For me, it was well-worth checking out .
I related to so much of your journey, and the things you learned from it.  That's what made it so valuable, to me, was that it wasn't only a series of adventures (though amazing enough!); you completed the circles by telling what you learned from them, and feeding your intuition with the nourishment .
Things are not always as they seem.  Love and patience can cover a multitude of sins.  Duncan is the type of man every woman hopes to find .
Loved the leading lady and all the characters,even Merry the dog.  Everyone wasn't perfect, just your average person.  I will read entire series .
Great book but it got bogged down.  The details about nothing got to be really boring.  Loved the three sister's, crazy Asian lady was so cute .
Family isn't always by blood.  Family isn't always perfect.  Family is about love, respect and responsibilities.  That was what Finley's Lass family was all about .
I love the fairies and their sense of honor.  Can't wait to see how Ian Gardner's its his turn.  Great job .
I know I'm required to write 20 words.  I think writing WOW! Twenty times would not express how much I enjoyed reading Black Sword.  I will be reading more of Kathryn Veque's books .
Blood,guts and Gore may not be every ones cup of tea.  But it made a twelve hour car trip fly by. Great book .
I thought the start was a little over the top.  The woman was to perfect.  Never a doubt or cross word.  But the support characters made the story.  Love her Father.  The love of family was the best part of this book .
MacDougall might be old and losing his marble.  His late wife ensured her daughters wouldn't be mindless pawns.  Cameron`s love and knowledge of healing wins the heart of a powerful Laird.  Their love binds the former enemies for life .
Strong woman not just sitting around knitting.  But willing to work with the man she loves to make life better for and her family .
I'm not a big fan of time travel books.  This one keep me reading.  A lot of stuff going on so it didn't get stuck on the time travel part .
My favorite book in a long time.  WOW! The sex was hot. Loved Grant as a second.  Family isn't always what it seems .
A quick read, all the knights makes you believe in honor.  The battles, the evil little men.  Pregnant Lehman. Not more you can ask for in a book .
Hard to follow if you aren't a die hard harry potter fan, but it was good enough to make me want to watch the second part .
great acting, little slow at some points, but still never felt like it was dragging. Very entertaining flick. Would definitely recommend .
Was a little nervous to order this online, but when it came in the mail it was perfect. We purchased this as a gift for someone else and they loved it! Great value, very easy to set up and take down. Durable and easy to store and travel with. Could use this anywhere, in the backyard or on the beach. Also sturdy and a good quality, which was nice because when we play the game it doesn't fall apart or get ruined. Would definitely purchase this again as a gift for someone else .
These hand towels are perfect for the office. We do not have a dispenser so we have them placed in a wicker basket and they are extremely functional .
I love his books. simple and to the point. It doesn't take a genius to figure out what he was trying to say but it takes a genius to convey the message. brilliant stuff .
This is a movie that likely isn't popular with many nationally, but is if you are from or grew up in the Northern Kentucky/Cincinnati, OH area, which I did.  Lots of cool things in this movie between seeing scenes in Pompelios Restaurant, the old landing on the river in Covington, KY which is gone, Riverfront Stadium when it was still here, and more.  As far as growing up is concerned, it is cool to watch if you grew up in the 1990s.  Jack Black and Seth Green plays roles in it well before they became known too .
Very good DVD if you are a Stone Temple Pilots fan.  Watching it and listening to them perform was no different than many of the concerts that I have seen them at live.  Great DVD .
Wow.....I'm not a reader but I loved this book.  I fantastic to finish the rest of Season of the Moon .
Enjoyed..........ready for the next book. I enjoyed this one. I'm not a reader but man I love these books. Thanks .
I wanted a new laptop after my old refurbished one decided to die a few years ago, and this was my gift to me! It's the best thing I think I've ever bought computer wise and when I purchased it it was on sale by a hundred bucks!The only thing I didn't expect was the material the cover was made from, but I can easily live with that .
I bought this for running around campus. It works well for the purpose. It folds small enough to fit in my apartment and rides well. It's not clear from the description or the pictures but it does come with a kickstand.This is a nice bike for short commutes .
I bought this bike ride around campus. It arrived well packed in good condition. I had a cyclist friend of mine put it together. It didn't take him very long, he only had a small issue with one of the tires but was able to resolve it. The bike rides well and friends are surprised when I tell them what I paid for it. It's amazing the things you can get on Amazon .
Downloaded it for an activity and the next day and it didn't work, had to buy it. Didn't want to buy it .
I saw all my favorite characters. And I saw old cartoon characters that I hadn't seen for a while. This game is awesome .
This has been one of the best games I have played in a long time. With the time I had playing this game was a blast and i give it five stars. But it also seems like to me that their is some thing missing at the end of two. If there making a third I can't wait to play it .
DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!Is the case supposed to charge the phone or the phone to charge the case! In this case it is the latter.Returning it right away .
It was a great book! I love Abbi Glines, period. I love the fact that you read up on a certain couple & then she makes more book about their close friends & their relationships. I get so sad when I'm near the end of the story because I never want it to end! Great read .
I loved every thing about it. If you haven't read it, read it now. So many twists & turns, you won't expect what's going to happen next. I sure as hell didn't waste a penny on this one .
Loved every single bit of it. Couldn't put my phone down. One of the best romance books out there. Definitely worth my money .
Great book &#128079; It was a lil too short for my taste but it was good. I can't wait to read the sequel .
I now can enjoy a BLT without the bread falling apart before I have it half eaten. Anyone who is gluten intolerant should buy some Namaste flour and bake a loaf of bread.  You will never buy GF bread from a store again .
I saw the video, didn't work the all. I may return it if got time for it, highly NOT recommended .
I am a big fan of Sherlock Holmes books. Because of that I bought this book Sherlock Holmes in 2012: TIMELESS DUEL which has been written by Mohammad Bahareth. I read this book really fast I didn't felt time past because the book is really interesting to read from beginning to end. This is such an excellent book among the plethora of books I have read so far .
I see this as a New york Times best seller with ease by the end of the year. You read books, and they are all pretty good, but every once in awhile something really grabs you. It's hard to say why, or describe it, as I'm not the writer type, just a reader looking for stories like this one. The subject matter is pretty severe, so its also hard to have a happy face when writing about it, but this book is one that points out the troubles kids have today and the families who ruin them. Throw in the Mob and a car, and a river filled with hope, and you've got Cadillac River. This book makes a point about abuse that will last a lifetime for sure. And if you are the type that likes to get depressed every now and then only to feel happy afterwards, then for sure you'll be at peace with this one .
I have 4 controllers. The GOW3 limited edition, an old black controller that has a mod that I bought a long time ago, the plain black controller that came with my console, and this one.This blows every other controller out of the water. The controller has endured lots of heavy gaming, and the mod has helped give me the edge on so many occasions. That extra split second of shooting faster does wonders. Everyone seems to play with mods now so unless you have one you can't really keep up. And I'm pretty sure this mod is better than a lot of other ones out there since I'm definitely shooting faster.I am really happy with my purchase. The price was right as well. I really feel that it was a great value since the GOW3 controller I bought was only $15 cheaper and it didn't have a mod or the cool look like this. Highly recommended .
very nice has plenty of viewing room, but had to back down the brightness and contrast wanted a large monitor and this fit the billwould recommend to a friend and buying from Amazon. no dead pixels easy to set up 3 year warrantee.UPS shipping not good .
was easy to setup, printing photos were great, scanning options, my MacBook found it easy But I haven't used the fax. I would recommend this to friends a good printer for the money .
so far good i use it with canon photo paper every thing nice and crisp tried cheaper paper didn't work as well .
I had a Jambox and loved it.  I always wished it was a little louder but the size was perfect.  The female receptor for the charging cord broke off and when I looked it up online I realized it's a huge problem.  The SuperTooth is  larger but so is the sound!  I can't believe how good it sounds.  The $90 I spent for this makes the $200 for the Jambox even more painful .
Item arrived incomplete and broken and also looks like toy. Once I open the package I felt discourage to install it. The item doesn't look like what was advertised .
This item was smaller than expected. It works ok just not noticeable, and the connection and control are just too plain .
I love this game its vary cool to me cuase u don't just got to have one horse u can have as .many as possible at lest i think .
I just purchased these batteries to go with my Meike battery grip. and one for a spare, both work amazing, i can't tell the difference, the battery life is good. Saved myself $30 - $70 instead of buying the overpriced canon batteries .
Well, I was disappointed when the necklace arrived in the mail. It does not look anything like the first image (profile picture of the item) I expected the feathers to be flying not attached to the circle. Very disappointed. But, it is nice though. I love it. Only thing that I wish is that it looked like the image and a bit more bigger maybe 2 inches or 2.5. instead of 1 1/4 inches .
I love the cover. I wish it was matte not glossy feeling. It tends to slip on car seats or things like that - very common for a phone cover. I always have like matte feeling covers but this one is worth it. no question .
Just love it . The cd had no scratches and cast  had no cracks you would think I bought it brand but I didn't .
anyone and everyone i give this a 5/5 because i didn't pay that much and i got it like brand new. cant get no better than this .
i give it a 4/5 because my fiance was looking all over for this cd but couldn't find it anywhere. then decided to look on amazon. pow! we found it but it was could of expensive for a underground artist but its what he wanted so he had to pay the piper .
You get what you paid for they look great work ok price is cheap not the best but itll work for the mean time .
4/5 anybody and everybody good cd and good price i recommend this to who ever digs this artist no money will be wasted even if you don't like the cd still good price .
I was looking for this the longest finally found it works great but don't fit thst many just one on each I guess thsts how its suppose to be .
Not only I love it  everyone one that see this sticker love it. Thanks alot. Oh, great affordable pricing. Thanks .
hi everybody i give it 5/5 cheap and like new can't get no better than that i recommend this to any and everybody .
broke my clip in the courthouse not a good day didn't know what to do almost bought a new otter case until i put my last hopes here. wow i cant believe it , i found only one for a reasonable price got to love it .
This is a great headset  total hands free way to go Motorola hope they continue with this 1 if I ever need another I'll get this 1 could not ask for a better Bluetooth .
I enjoyed this book very much.  It showed caring for people that had never found God and a good love story too .
I have played this game every day since I downloaded it. Annoying when I don't get to the next level, but I can't stop trying. Great for the mind too .
I thought it would be like Marble Saga, which is a fast paced game.  It's ok just not a favorite .
My children and I love listening to this while in the car. They can nor get enough of it.Yay .
Before I begin I Would like to mention that I was supplied with a sample to test and evaluate this product, but I promise to give my honest and fair opinion.So having been used to Anker's higher-tier gaming mouse I was able to compare this one to that one, but also on a general use basis. It is a completely different mouse, and thus is has better and worse features.Product exterior: I have quite big hands, and this was comfortable to use but not for an extended duration, as I don't like to eagle grip my mouse's. Don't misread this though, it is still big enough for the average person and those with slightly bigger hands. One awesome point for this mouse though is that the whole surface area glows! This is one of the features that was missing on the higher-tier version and it looks awesome. You can have different colours depending on the DPI setting, and customize how fast it pulsates, of course it can be continual or off completely.Description of use: As with all of the Anker products I have tried or bought, it is extremely easy to install and use for an average user or above. It is quite weighty for a mouse with no interchangeable weights, which is a good sign of quality. On the higher-tier mouse you can, so this would be a semi-negative point for this model. The performance in FPS games were good, I didn't notice any mouse lag while using my Razer Goliathus mouse mat, and I wouldn't expect any different.Ideal users: I would say that mainly gamers would benefit from this mouse, as it is a gaming mouse and is designed to be comfortable for compatible hands for extended periods of time. But even the Facebook, Email casual users would enjoy this for its comfort and visual looks, it is pretty damn cool.Competitive comparison: I can only compare this to the higher-tier mouse I currently own, but if I were to only use one it would have to be the higher tier purely for comfort reasons and the fact it has interchangeable weights. If I didn't have big hands though, the aesthetics of this model would definitely tempt me to use it as a main mouse. I will still use this mouse though, for when I take my rig somewhere and want to make a statement, as it just looks cooler.Summary: This mouse is a steal for the price, and is perfect for those who are looking for top quality gaming/media peripherals. Just bear in mind that if you have big hands like me, this may not be the one for you. All in all I would say it is up there with Razer, and Steelseries .
This is the worst Hookah that I have ever bought and smoked, couldn't be more unhappy, tastes terrible! Do not purchase .
The design is chipping off the hard shell and the pattern does not line up correctly on the sides of the case .
There are great works of literature and there is kitsch. This book will not shape the world but it was well written and enjoyable, and never ceased to give my body chills .
I Love the turtle design. Its a perfect fit and the fabric is super soft , quality cotton. You're not wasting money when u buy this product .
Wasn't sure about the product but ordered it anyways. Highly recommended!!! Easy installation and VERY loud!! Mounted the horns under the hood out of sight and they definitely get someone's attention. Highly highly recommended!! Hurry up and order them you won't regret it! The best part is they showed up early .
these have to be the worst possible speaker mounts to buy. The diagram on how to put them together is atrocious and doesn't even give good detail. plus i lost a part in one of my keyhole mounted speakers so now i cant even mount. Spend you money on speakers that arent total pieces of $#it .
Bought 2yrs ago in size 8(no strap) and was slightly small so went up to next size.. V comfy but backstrap loose so cut it off .
- I like the set of unusual flavoured jams, salsas and pickles. There's a lot of experimentation that's gone on to come up with these recipes!- As a non-American, I love the fact that there are metric measurements provided- Some other reveiwers commented on lack of information about headspace, omitting to use lemon juice in every recipe, etc. I think there is a cultural difference here- I am used to working with recipes that don't provide this information and I don't personally know anyone that would be fazed by this (we use the Australian Fowler's Vacola system rather than Ball Mason jars... and have always just used the headspace that's specified for the jar size). I suppose if you're starting out preserving then get your basic information from another source and use this for the nice recipes .
I have used other less expensive blonde/silver shampoos and they left my hair feeling crunchy.  My hairdresser uses all the Soma products and I purchased this shampoo from her and absolutely loved it but it was expensive there.  I found it on Amazon at a fraction of the price.  This shampoo makes my hair feel silky and smooth and I don't  even need to use conditioner.  I strongly recommend this product .
A lot technical machinery and artillery I found hard to follow.Not an easy book to read. unless perhaps you are military .
All those children not able to learn to read or write and a Father involved in incest.Waste of money.  And I am from Alaska .
This was a messed up situation.Seller was not too pleasant.I ended up with a chair that has a noticable flaw.Return policy on this item is very poor.Customer must keep the chairs up to 3 weeks before returning.I coudl not store this chair for 3 weeks.  So I just kept it .
Easy to use and lots of good music to choose from for downloads. Worth the purchase I don't regret it .
This toy was a huge disappointment. For $20 I did not expect the lights to stop working after the first week. I thought it was the batteries that failed. I went to change them and the battery compartment was all rusted. You would think for a bath toy and an expensive one at that they would construct the toy better. A huge disappointment on my part. I am glad my son is only 20 months old and doesn't really know what had happened. I am currently seeking to find who makes this toy and to write to this company .
EXCELLENT PRODUCT!excellent product a little late in coming! buy 2 different item in the shop and sent in two boxes! one did not come .
I only had it on my phone for a week before the clip broke right off!! Save your money and don't bother with it .
This book chronicles the near-death and spiritual insights given to one man, for himself, about the coming tribulations prophesied for this earth.  An understanding of the Old Testament 'Book of Isaiah' bears out events of the Last Days, although not in such detail.  Combine these two books with Avraham Gileadi's ISAIAH DECODED:  ASCENDING THE LADDER TO HEAVEN, and one feels joy and comfort that the Lord is personally engaged in our individual lives.  WE advance towards Him, or distance ourselves from Him, by the moral choices we make!Bobbie Holmes .
My boyfriend is in the navy and I couldn't help but buy this as a late Christmas present for him.......well.....for him to enjoy :p I have only used it once because I want to use it on special occasions only, but the one time I did wear it I loved it! im 5'6 and I size 13 ( with that said I am thick but not very overweight, I have big hips, a small rib cage and I wear a c in most bras) I bought a large and was worried about the fact that some people said it shows all your curves but my tummy looked flat as ever and the dress went right over my bum. ( I could wear it for Halloween if I wanted to )The back shows a small amount of your back but for the most part its a fairly modest+sexy costume that definitely screams pin up girl :]PS: BUY THE WHITE STOCKINGS! it looks incomplete without them .
It fits well in the carts and highchairs very easy to wipe off .. and not to mention the sippy cup ring that is amazing just in itself. i mean how many of us mom's have to stop in the middle of the aisle to chase a bottle or a sippy cup so this makes it amazing for that reason .
WOW!!! is what i say about this amazing CD..each song is so beautiful in every way ..when i started listening to the cd, a great calm and peace came over me..the day i got it home it so happened to be a bad day for me ..thank you Micheal Castaldo for making what was a bad day for me, a much better day, i love your voice and your music..unfortunately i can't say which song would be my favorite because they are all equally amazing. keep them coming!!!!spettacolare, la voce e la musica di Micheal Castaldo sul cd Bergamotto, ogni canzone &egrave; incredibile, se si acquista questo CD che non rimarrete delusi .
Works very well, very pleased with it, shipping was right in time. Have nothing to complain about this item .
Not pleased with it at all. Very bad image display with camera already experiencing problems with freezing very bad sound quality .
I was so disappointed because it fit a s4 not a s3. I would like to return it and get a case for my correct phone .
I would recommend this product to any one who does not like their drinks to get watered down. I remember when I used to get to the bottom of the drink and it be weak as all get out, but now with the whiskey stones its strong all the way down. I gave this five stars because it helped me so much and was exactly what I expected. This is a must have for whiskey drinkers .
I really liked this phone case from the moment I saw it the first time online. So&#8230; I bought it. I received it quickly enough. Opened it and still really liked it a lot. I had it on my phone for about 2 months. The design started coming off of the back turning it to just a plain white plastic case on the edges&#8230;. not cute. Also&#8230; only put this case on your phone if you practically never want it to come off ever again&#8230; It took me multiple tries to get it off and I had to stick a butter knife in between the sides to get it loose .
very good can't wait to read some more .its really a page turneryea you better believe it baby woww .
I just received this dvd and it was better than expected, Al tells a story that I never knew. I love this interview and of course the music is always great .
I purchased this since each time it has come on television I watch it, now i can watch it over and over, Can not get enough of it, always seem to find something I did not see before, Great movie .
Just received this one today and it was totally unexpected, in great condition and worth the purchase my grandson could not wait to open and play with it .
my grand son is really into thomas and his friends since he was almost 2 and he seems to never get enough .
I love this dvd, I actually ordered it thinking I did not have it in my collection but later found I had it, but two is better than one sometimes .
I got this for my grandkids, It was great, my grandson was into wubbzy but after awhile he didn't care much for it, I think it was just him and not the movie however, children change daily .
didn't realize that this movie was so good until i saw it on tv a few times then i decided i had to have it in my collection .
My grandson was surprised with this for Valentines day, he has not put it away since, He loves it alot .
This book was so nice. I loved how just hearing her voice and then seeing her, he knew he liked her and wanted to know more. They have such a nice relationship and although there is a point where the mum gets involved but they don't let her ruin what they have! They help each other through things like the female main characters music issue.. the characters are well thought out because they can tell when one another are thinking things and when they know something's up they can talk it through... together. This story is one that I think everyone would like to have as their own life story. Would recommend to friends .
Es un libro apasionante de historias no conocidas ( al menos para mi), donde se refleja el valor y entrega de personas desconocidas que se jugaban la vida en aras del objetivo comunMuy bien escrito y no se puede dejar hasta el final .
if you are between sizes 8 and 12 this will not fit you. I am a size 5 and it did not fit me. very tight. very short. the standard size is not correct .
I liked the way it rhymed...but, didn't like that the rhyme was on the same page.It was a cute idea and Mrs. Jolly Bones was quite funny.The pictures were awesome and made the book really interesting to see what what going on...and there was A LOT going on !!KIDS LOVE IT .
I ordered mine and quality is good. But my only problem I ordered for tab 3 lite Samsung and the protector is not the right one as it is with for a front camera and mine has it in the back, it was the wrong one I noticed .
I wasn't sure what to expect from this knife at first but I must say I was very pleased with the knife as soon as I received it. The weight behind this knife is very good in my opinion it isn't too light or too heavy but right in between with a great feel on the handle. It has a very sharp edge that can slice through anything I put in front of it so far, which is a lot as I work in a professional kitchen, and it hasn't lost one bit of that sharpness!! This definitely a great work horse knife that can withstand a lot and won't get dinged up easily in my opinion. Great for work or a collection as it just looks great too .
This is an amazing gift from an amazing lady, with a gift of Love from above.  I purchased 3 and immediately needed one for my daughter, as her best friend Bud had found a way out of the gated backyard, hit by a car, surgery and did not make it through the night.  A gift given to help heal a broken heart, when you truly do not have the words to express your pain felt by your child's pain and suffering .
I WAS KIND OF UNSURE ABOUT BUYING THIS BOOT BECAUSE OF THE PICTURE THEY USED THE PICTURE THEY HAVE POSTED MAKES THE BOOT LOOK FADED AND JUST PLAIN UNLIKABLE BUT..... WHEN I GOT THEM IN THE MAIL THEY WERE THE EXACT OPPOSITE THEY DIDNT LOOK FADED OR USED ... IM DEF GOING TOO BE BUYING SOME MORE AS SOON AS THE PROCE DROP BACK DOWN .
This product is TERRIBLE. lets start from the very beginning , I used this product for about a month before i started having problems ... my routine was 1. was face 2. apply mena cream all of over face 3. go too sleep 4. wake up and wash face. I ONLY applied at night . After using the product i start having problem with my eyes ... the skin on the top of both of my eyelids become very dry scaly and flaky the skin on the bottom was very sore and red , my eyes were very itchy and dry ALSO it created bags with lines under my eyes , many may ask how do you know it was the product might i add i have never had any of these symptoms a day in my life and i didn't start getting them till i used this product ...... I have bags under my eye and i'm only 19. I order two of the mena cream and used all of my first one and Only applied for maybe 4 nights of the second before I nothiced it was The MENA CREAM causing all my eye problems .... && its not Allergy i have never had any none allergies in my life Also while using the MENA CREAM the skin under my eyes became very elastic  but tightned back up after i stop using this product  Also i didnt notice any lighting while using it either ... I bought it not to bleach my skin but too get rid of the dark marks on my  face IT DIDNT WORK .... if you buy before using i would ask your doctor ... Im not sure if this is a tested product or not .... But im very dissapointed and is still having eye problems till this day because of this product.... I TOTALLY REGRET BUYING THIS PRODUCT .
YES THE CASE IS CUTE BUT ...... IT IS VERY HARD TO SLIDE YOUR PHONE WITH THIS CASE ON AND IT IS NOT DURABLE AT ALL .
I WAS UNSURE BECAUSE I DIDNT WANT TOO GET THEM AND THEY BE TOO LITTLE CAUSE I REALLY DONT UNDERSTAND THE RETURN POLICY BUT ..... THEY WERENT THERE REALLY CUTE AND I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THEM .
IT IS VERY CUTE BUT..... YOU DEF WANT TO ORDER A SIZE UP FROM WHAT YOUR ORIGINALLY GOING TO BUY ... BUT TO BE HONEST NO MATTER WHAT SIZE YOU GET THE BOTTOMS ARE GOING TOO BE SMALL UNLESS YOUR A CHILD SO PLAN ON BUYING YOUR OWN BOTTOMS  OTHER THAN THAT I LOVE IT AND WILL BE BUYING IT AGAIN .
We are so thankful to be able to find the exact same DVD Player that my son has had for several years.  He is disabled and when he finds a scene that he really likes or wants to watch again to understand it better he likes to rewind and fast forward the movie and you can not do that on most of the DVD players.  I hope that this feature is never taken away from this product.  Will continue to buy this product as long as it has this feature .
Because this series could not go into great detail, for it would be a longer production to include content, this Bible presentation came across in epic proportions. With good narratives, the Bible story did follow a clear time line. Great cinematography!Beautiful musical score! Should have been made for the big screen movie theaters .
It was amazing a breath taking novel. I couldn't stop reading,every page I turned I was ready for new excitement .
I was really disappointed with this product. It came with everything it says but The screen was peeling off of the electronic stuff that makes the screen. It did not come with instructions. I had to look up how to do it online. The guy who showed me was doing a excellent job but the screen was broken.. Give it a try but just know I warned you .
A great and enlightening lecture, not only for learning and remembering the principles of mediation but also for cherishing one`s true self without harming the others .
Although this case was just what I thought, it was not very protective. I dropped it about 5 minutes later and my screen cracked .
Matt Chandler didn't change the Gospel; he didn't add to it or take away from it, as the Bible can't be changed. He merely explained certain truths about the Gospel to help the reader begin to comprehend the absolute HUGENESS of it, as much as our infantile minds can really wrap around it. Matt Chandler and his book made me really sit and pinder the vastness of the universe, God's infinite power and creativity, and just how truly monumental Jesus sacrifice on the cross was. Prepare to be mind blown when you read this book. And know that you'll probably be heavily convicted to share the Word when you're done, which is the whole point of your existence .
I bought these 2 years ago after seeing the beautiful red poppies blooming all over Italy.I planted LOTS (500- 1000 seeds) around my Olive Trees in the fall in California and didn't get a single plant.  That said, I planted them in an area where not much grows, but I thought I would at least get one plant!On the plus side the seeds are cheap.I'm going to try again this year, but will start them in a raised bed and transplant if they grow. They should California Poppies grow in my raised beds and I didn't even plant them!I'll update and let you know if they work.Fred .
As usual,  MItch Alboms writing is superb. He can bring you into  a story, like no other writer can.  If you believe in the devil  you must also believe in God, and Albom can help you do that. His stories transport you to that world, the world we all need to help us through this one we live in. We could all use at least one more day with those we have lost, and this book gives us hope that it could happen .
this is such a good book.  I wouldn't be without it. and it is written so simply everyone could understand it.  this book is changing my life for the better.  it tells you how your thoughts affect your life and the changes that happen in your body when your angry, sad or happy.  it's all about how to disconnect the hard wiring that goes on when you repetitively think and do the same thing over and over.  it helps you break old habits that don't serve you.  i'd recommend it for anyone wanting to improve their lives and move on .
an interesting enjoyable book. one you may want to refer back to often. the physical features i wasn't sure about.  would have been helpful to have sketches or photos.  but overall a good reference book .
this was great it cemented what i already felt about the world and society.  was appalled at seeing young boys (seemed 5-6yrs old) in a boxing ring, how could parents allow that, it's crazy. we have become so insensitive to who we truly are so need to get back to basics. unfortunately we allow money to rule our lives and it's not getting us anywhere. society has to change and i know it will .
i ordered this and it got here ontime but i am disappointed. first i opened the package and the nail gel was not even in its box. Then when i opened the nail gel it looks like its been used. it already has hardend gel around the rim. Then i went to go put the cap back on and it doesn't shut properly. i do nt want to pay to ship it back on somthing this little so i am keeping it and going to try it as is. Everything i order on Amazon never comes great, but when i pay the extra money and get i off its original websit it comes outstanding .
a good read on a cold winter evening, but not very exciting.  I won't be rushing to buy another of his books .
There are Two sizes of Kindle Fire and you sold me the one for the old model, which I had to return. The one I purchased at another location was twice as expensive and not as versatile. I ordered it right after Christmas 2013 and it should have been obvious it was for the new product or you should have asked which I had.I am very unhappy and will be very gun shy shopping online in the future .
if you are a mother of kids, you need this!I almost threw 5 uniform shirts to the garbage.. I had every stain remover from the supermarket. nothing helps my boys' mess.I tried #2 and #8 as a last resort... I soaked the shirts overnight with a whole bottle of each number (together), and all of the old food stains came off. amazing. worth every penny if you like your clothes .
it's medium weight white scrapbook size paper, a bit textured. I didn't see that mentioned in the product's details.my daughter uses it for all kinds of stuff except for scrapbooking. she made a lemonade stand sign on it, birthday cards and more .
ok so i decided to give it a try.I hate cleaning. I have a really good cleaning lady that does the job better than me.but when it comes to oven racks- no matter how much you scrub and try to clean them with harsh chemicals it just doesn't clean it competely. (I forgot to say that even though i hate cleaning, i love a clean house. lol. so i notice the smallest things if its not clean)I love carbona products. I had success with each and every one of them. especially stain devils for my boys toddler clothes. so i decoded to try it.my oven is about 8 noths old now, and i never really clean the racks very seriously. I tried with steelwool but gave up almost immediately. so you can imagine how dirty they were. we are a family pf six so we use the oven on a daily basis.I have a bosch slide in convection oven. the racks are a bit narrower than a regular oven. I barely managed to put all 3 of them in the bag and seal it. i was thinking of sealing it with wide tape which could give the racks a bit more room. but my husband did it for me and the zip just closed. so I was ok. this is the only reason I gave it 4 and not 5 stars.I put it around 7pm, mooved the liquid around a few times untill I went to sleep. the liquid was becoming brown very quickly and i could see the burned dirt slightly coming off. I didnt clean the racks before. i was too lazy.the next morning I washed them in the bathtub- the liquid was black. and the racks were sparkly clean without any effort!!!amazing .
protein drink never tasted better! this drink is so smooth, like drinking soy milk, but thicker and more filling...I LOVE the fact that it is completely dairy free as I am lactose intolerant as well as 2 of my kids ( one is allergic)it IS a little too sweet and has a nice amoubt of carbs, which is whyi gave it 4 stars.I use stevia nd used to the taste so I didn't feel any problem with "aftertaste" as some of the reviewers commented.I guess you get used to it.my kids all love it (2,4 and 1o year old) so i give it to them sometimes as a breakfast, to keep them more focused and less hungry in school.my favorite is the vanilla.sometimes I add it to my protein fruit fiber shake for better flavor .
maybe its my fault but i didn't look at the measurments, I thought its a laptop/ letter size for folders binders etc. but its much bigger and of no use to me.the tote itself is ok i guess for the price, but i never got to test it .
the fit is true to size. i bought the XL, pre pregnancy im a 14 on top and 16 on bottom, and it was a bit large by the top part but i expected that...i got the orange color which is like salmon.the fabric is soft and drapes nicely.overall the dress looks GREAT on me and I'm so happy! its not easy to find a maternity evening dress and this one is everything I was looking for .
I was looking for a body scrub for my back acne.I found this and decided to give it a try.It is cheap, it has a very pleasant scent that i absolutely LOVE.but the &#34;beads&#34; that are supposed to scrub and polish your skin are not very substantial and they dissolve very quickly. so it ends up like a regular soap for me .
I have no complaints at all about the case itself. it serves me well. but the colors are not accurate- there is a lot of red in it, not just pink, and I don't like it that much. I really liked the color combination in the picture, but got something slightly different and not as pretty, to my taste .
I'm diabetic and always trying to become healthier.always looking for bars that have smaller content of carbs/sugar and greater contents of protein and healthy fat.I personally DO NOT like the flavor of the lara bar and the like. its like eating mashed dates. i do like dates but the bars are not my favorite.that being said, these bars are perfect! they have i think 16g of carbs and 7 g of protein which is great for me. ([ardon me if the numbers are not exact i don't have the bar in front of me but im pretty sure these are the numbers or about that, check the label)and we didnt talk about the flavor/texture yet!it is so much tastier than the lara bar kind of bar. it tastes and feels like rice crispie bar... its not too sweet but also not bitter or something... its just good! and my kids love it too .
The book &#34;Heaven&#34; is everything I hoped it would be.  Have not finished it yet, but the outlook it gives you is definitely positive .
Great Product, Easy to set up...People said you have to suck the water through the hose to get it started? That's one way, but if you filled the intake hose up with water and cover the end of the hose with your thumb you'll create a natural suction. Meaning you won't have to suck any water through the hose. Just simply put the filter head in the tank, put a bucket at the end of the hose where you're holding the hose with your thumb and let go, once the water starts to pour through the hose, close the valve and connect it to the filter can. Once connected open the valve, let the can fill up with water and then plug it in .
1. Awesome technology (Soft Shell)2. Easily remove ear piece, makes it great for warm days3. The lining on the inside can be removed just in case you wanted to wear a beanie under it... you don't have to go a size bigger for the beanie look. Just get a nice thin layered beanie .
Bought the three package and now I only have one outer case. The plastic is cheap and broke after less than a week. I wouldn't recommend or buy this again. Waste my money .
I bought this for the funnel cakes but guess i was wrong i didn't even get some of it due to missing parts. the mix was all over bags cut the metal ring was bent bad. wast of my money. i never buying this kit ever .
These leaves were absolutely beautiful!! The vibrant colors just popped off my cards.  I used them for envelope seals too. Just beautiful! The only issue I had with these Autumn leaves is they didn't come in various sizes .
This is the Best album of the year...not only because Adam has an Outstanding Voice..but the structure of the Songs and the mix of styles match perfectly with what people wants to listen to have fun and being introspective at the same time.- .
As soon as I read the title of this book, I was stoked to read it. I was not let down. I have been hearing a lot and seeing a lot about the health benefits of "juicing" (no, not steroids, but making juices from raw, fresh veggies at home). My family actually bought a juicer; however, there were actually MANY simple facts about how our bodies work with what we eat. She addresses everything from misconceptions to recipes. Once I tried a few of the recipes, my reservations about drinking the vegetable/fruit mixes completely dissolved. I couldn't believe how delicious some of it was together! She stated that with this book as your guide, you'll be "on your way in no time." And she definitely delivered. It made learning about nutrition fun and interesting - easy to read, but not boring. At first glance, it seems like it will be brief and general, but I was surprised to find so many technical questions answered, and so much information provided. It was a quick read but it has a wealth of knowledge. This book is a total beginners guide that sheds light AND motivates, yet doesn't take months to get through .
When I first started to read the introduction of How Children Succeed, I was a little weary that it would turn in to one of those books that tells you never let your kids experience sadness and keep them happy all the time. In fact, this book was quite the opposite and a breath of fresh air! I have quotations highlighted on almost every page of this book! It kind of helped me see areas in which I struggle, but also showed me how I have improved and what I can change to help my kids, as well. It was both helpful in looking at my past, and hopeful for the future, while inspiring me today. The 30 minute summary gave just enough to give me an appetite, but left out enough that the full version is calling my name. It's definitely going on my wish list for this Christmas! Honestly, I was interested in this book originally because I have kids and I want to help them succeed, but I really do recommend this book to anyone (esp. those with trauma or trouble in their backgrounds). It brought some sense to what I have been dealing with in my own life .
It fits my son good, but I thought it came with the purple hood as well. My son hasn't wore it/played with it as much as I thought he would .
Not sure this would fit a size 6. My son is a size 3T and it fits him good so I'm hoping it won't be snug when I put sweats under it .
My son loved his pinata. I was a bit disappointed though since it was dented in on the top when I received it in the mail. I wasn't able to get the dent out. Good thing my son was only turning 3 so it didn't bother him .
This product is probably the simplest and most comfortable nursing pillow on market. With the firm thinner bottom layer and a cushioned larger upper layer, it fits any baby's need for nursing comfort. It is also really durable. So far, one month in, it has handled rain, gravel, pavement, and picnic wear and still looks new.I personally love the adjustable strap, because it lets my baby snuggle up close to me when I'm nursing. The closeness also makes her fall asleep and look cute all snuggled up! Speaking of being snuggled up, it has served me as a pillow on a 6 hour trip southbound.I would recommend this pillow to any mother nursing or just bottle-feeding. Even a bottle-fed baby loves to cuddle, right? Best buy for it's price by far and would buy it again, not that it will wear out to need one .
Love it! The color is awesome. It fit perfect. It got here fast and cost a fraction of what it cost at samsung. I have No complaints .
It's not that great but gets the job done. It does not fit snug in the phone so with some movement, it stops charging and you have to readjust.  You get what you pay for .
Doesn't pick up pet hair like I thought it would.  The other reviews did not say that.Did not fully meet my expectations .
I have had this knife for about 6 months now. I take it hiking and camping. I haven't even noticed the weight. I have used it for food prep and batoning wood. It came out of the box ready to go, razor sharp. It is my &#34;survival knife&#34; I am confident it can handle any situation you would need a knife for, from making feather sticks to batoning .
I placed these on my BK-2, they work well. They are comfortable and the grip is good. I did hit some spots with sand paper to smooth it out. Other than that no issues .
I have the Tel lok attached to my Becker BK-2 sheath, works great. Attaching and removing is easy. You can't mount it to carry knife in vertical or horizontal position .
My toaster is Great!!  I love waking up in the morning to a nice egg mcmuffin that I don't have to watch!!  I set it and go get ready for work, then it's done and I am enjoying a nice breakfast that's half the calories of McDonalds.  This construction worker is very happy!!!  A Must have for the busy guy.  My wife Loves that I don't make her make me food anymore too at 5:00am .
If you've never seen Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, then don't hesitate buying this. It has an amazing story line and plot. The animation is unbelievable, every episode is like watching a movie. I definitely would recommend this .
This is a great gaming PC (shell)... BUT... don't expect to get very many FPS on the majority of games.  The GT610 and 300W PSU are very weak if you want to play the latest and greatest games.  I am upgrading to a GTX760 and a 630W PSU.  I will review those once they are installed.  Overall, the PC is pretty nice.  Love the red and black... GO DAWGS .
I have had this for a little over a week and I can not put it down!  I absolutely love it.  A word of advice though for the PC streaming... first, make sure you have all the specs that NVIDIA recommends covered... second, make sure you have a very good router for the wifi.  If you don't, you will get some laggy and pretty much unplayable gameplay.  I highly recommend the NVIDIA SHIELD for anyone that loves to game and that also likes to game on the go.  Very portable and easy to store with an excellent battery.  AND... you can't beat this month of April price... for now anyway!  ORDER IT TODAY AND ENJOY .
lamentablemente nunca llego nada, prometieron que el dia 3 maximo llegaria lo que pague sin embargo esto jamas llego y estoy muy desilucionado por ello, no recomiendo al vendedor ni a ups como empresa de envio .
Stay away with this product. It is really a cheap quality product. Sometimes it charges and sometimes it won't charge. Eventhough it charges sometime, it takes very very long time to charge .
Because it's a true story and it brings to perspective what's going on in the world today. This book brings out some serious emotions that I'd never though i would get just from reading a book .
This the best word game. I don't play a lot of word games but when I do I always get the best .
Forms a nice sphere; it was not hard to do. The sphere produced easily fits into most glasses and does not melt easily .
The book is as good as new, if not new.  I hoped it would be easier to read.  I can only focus a few pages at a time.  I bought it for my grandson, but I want to read it first.  I'll keep at it.  It is very interesting and informative.  Things to think about .
Can not use it, it looks very old and used!!!!!sigh,I do not want to return it because it is in China right now .
The mouse wheel didn't work at all....so after first time I just left it alone until I see it today....so write my experience....the others are good, looks nice .
I'm a smaller woman with very tiny wrists and even though I like big watches this one is pretty big.  It's a unisex so I kind of expected it but I have to put the watchband on the last notch for it to fit.  Thankfully that fits but then there is so much watchband hanging around.  Overall I love the functions and it's easy to set, I love the color, and the display.  It's a great watch and I highly recommend it for someone who does not have child size wrists .
Don't waste your money. I could have bought a nicer set for less. Painting on figures is terrible, some animals are not to scale with the others. Picture is deceiving .
Oblivion will be criticized for its lack of originality, and this may be deserved, but what it lacks in mind blowing plot twists it makes up for in energy, presentation, and overall effect.The movie creates two contrasting worlds brilliantly: the clinical 2001esque angles of the cloud condo and drone technology, complete with an ominous hal-like red eye, and the broken cyberpunk remnants of civilization, now home to the Scavenger adversaries from which Cruises character must protect himself. More than once, I found myself looking at concepts I'd seen before, but never did I feel Oblivion failed to recreate these mainstays of the Sci-fi genre in its own way; rather, it did a brilliant job of making some of them its own.I enjoy Cruise in Sci-fi roles, there's something house-hold about him that keeps things relevant. He delivers a typical steadfast performance as the care taker of humanities remaining presence on earth, but he's bettered by Angela Riseborough's witty and emotional depiction of his bed sharing Communications Officer. Other notable names aside, it's a one man show with Cruise firmly at the helm, but whereas other movies may have been built for him, this one was not.In summary, Oblivion is a very well made and well paced movie, which manages to cover a wide portion of the Sci-fi genre, without copying it. It's a satisfying and beautifully shot film, with an unpredictably predictable end .
I love this Troubleshooters series! Suzanne Brockman is an awssome author, I really enjoy her work. I can't wait to read her next book .
Nothing much to say, this figure is a must have for gundam fans, this is my first metal build and I'm glad I bought it .
I absolutely love this game! It's my favorite and I'm always playing it. Although recently, when I open it it will crash within two minutes and its never done this before. Am I the only one having this problem?? If it's something to do with the game please fix it immediately .
This game is so much fun! I downloaded it a while back but never got the chance to play it but now that I've started it up again I can't put my kindle down! I would recommend it .
First of all I should mention that I bought this cover &#34;used&#34; (it was in Like New condition) through Amazon Warehouse for $17.99. For this price I am very happy with this cover. However, I definitely don't think it's worth $60. My kindle fits in perfectly and the light works wonderfully. Some other reviewers complained about the cover not having a strap to keep it closed, but it has yet to bother me. I have noticed that the front cover has acquired a few scratches after traveling in my purse/bookbag, but aesthetics is not a big deal for me. I'd definitely recommend this cover (at the warehouse price) for people who value functionality .
this is a fast pace game and yeah I don't no what ems there is about this game that I like but I do .
Yes everything was just fine no problems and my postman didn't even loose them on me . However the package was much larger than the items inside .
I like the looks of this fountain but have bought twice and returned twiceall because the motor gives out short of 2 weeks if that. I made sure it hadplenty of water and kept it nice and clean and then frustrationrears it's ugly head b/c the company makes a crappy motor. Also wanted toadd that I have reported this to the company letting them know that thesedo not last that long .
What I liked was the item listed was the package I receivedThese Ranger keys were everything I expectedNo broken parts/everything intactWorks great with my Super Mega Saber even thothese keys do not generate any different sound .
It works well but didn't read the thing right and thought some drum sticks came with the bag haha I will know next time .
Thanx to the previous reviewers for their insights into the performers and the songs on this albumwithout whom no one (i.e., me for example) would have the foggiest idea WHAT they could be buying!Doesn't it ever occur to Amazon independent sellers that potential customers (those are the ones whospend the *money* to get these discs) might want to know WHO is playing, and WHAT they are playing?I for one am so tired and disgusted with nameless performers unlisted on CDs with no tune titles toeven consider.  Furthermore, I'm also a bit disappointed with Amazon itself for not pointing out thismajor gap on the sellers' offerings.  Wise up, folks, the profits will be yours .
Flabbergasted should have Dick's and Derek's (Smith) picture next to it in the dictionary... not thatTHEY are surprised at their brilliant 2:10-minute microcosmic shattering of all other recordings ofthe Gershwin tune, "That Certain Feeling," but so that anyone with musical chops will know who dunnit!  The rest of this motion picture soundtrack is intermittently better than others you mightbe attracted to, but these two cats REALLY burn up the town with their call-and-answer passages.  Too, too bad that it's only 130 seconds of delirious genius. Also it's too, too bad that theirunassuming musicianship is never going to be heard by anyone who skips over this CD. I will neverquite recover from the chills these gentlemen produced by their superlative handling of anothergreat Gershwin Brothers' creation.  Do yourself a favor --get it, and dig a set of skills thathas no peer, and that remains terribly underappreciated in the world .
I was avidly browsing through the recorded evidence of  *Natalie Dessay's* brilliant vocal performances --having recently heard her on a free TV arts network music CD extract.  Not realizing that into Ms. Dessay's amazing recordings would be inserted [mirabile dictu] items featuring OTHER operatic personalities such as Bev Sills and Te Kanawa.  So... without reading carefully, I mistakenly bought THIS version of Richard Strauss's "Arabella."  Let this be a warning to all semi-conscious shoppers.  Dessay sings Strauss inimitably.And I WILL succeed in finding the "holy grail" of her performance.  But, woe is me!  Until then, I shall haveto be content with Kanawa.  Sorry, wrong singer.... And I can't blame Amazon for misleading me (I think .
I love love Miss Julia Seris--this one may be the best---have not gotten to the other 2-I except they will be just as great!!!!!--LOVE, LOVE Miss Julia .
Awesome. I loved the characters. I can not wait for the next book. I hope it lives up to the first in one .
I'm really pleased with this item. It arrived 4 days before it was suppose to! It's great at doing what a corset should. The only thing that I think could be improved is the bust. It does boost my cleavage but not as much as I would have liked. Over all it's a great product .
I had never read anything by this Author, but decided to purchase this book.  I'm glad I did.  It was such a great read. I was enthralled from the beginning and finished the book quickly.  It was a lovely story.  I will buy this Authors books in the future.  It gets 5/5 Stars from me .
This book showed no pictures of current styles.  Reading about current cuts does not help you picture it!  Not worth 2.99 .
picked product based on picture got same/similar product but not what was in picture still works for me for what i needed .
Came onto the music scene, amazed us with his powerful voice skills, and belted several hit songs about relationships. This song, &#34;Never Gonna Give You Up&#34;, refers to taking a friendship to the next level. A lot of people relate well to the opposite sex, and most have at least one of those friends as a true, close confidante, who hears, then listens, to how the people they date treat them so bad. Rick help us to not hold back by singing that 'your true love is right in front of you as you speak' .
From the lone piano beginning to the full orchestra, filling the depths of my heart with the profound meaning of living without someone.  It's a clear message of how a person can make us feel, so strong and penetrating to the bone, to live without their love is not a life worth living .
Strong vocals bring this song to life; saying that just to be separated from the one love is agonizing, to the point of begging for them to return as soon as possible.  Add the haunting interlude of the soprano made me feel the emptiness that the person left in his heart .
One of their best songs ever written.  It hits the head on a lot of relationships today.  No one seems to know what it means to be realistic, and care for the one who is there for them, no matter what .
The plant came in a box filled with stuff so it wouldn't be damaged. It arrived a little late and it is very small. However, the plant's condition was very good .
The case is not printed as clear as it looks online. Though it was shipped at a very outstanding time, my case has a huge dash and scratch in it. Because of the mark on my case I don't want to use it. Now I'm trying to contact the seller and can't seem to find anyway to get ahold of them to tell them about my damaged case .
fast delivery, item as described! Wow Ruben Blades y Willie Colon  que duo!!!!!!!! musica excelente. Do u own it? if not u have to get it too! uff good stuff! "Buscando guayaba ando yo" very pleased .

After shopping around a bit, Eden Pond looked to have the lowest price per count for this supplement. However, even if the price isn't the lowest, the product is of good quality. It is important to me that this brand has none of the artificial ingredients/binders/fillers that a lot of other brands seem to have. I take these for joint pain/anti-inflammation, and I only ever take one a day. This is not enough to notice an effect, but it is enough to stop me from noticing my pain, and I have been using ibuprofen less frequently since starting to use this product. Would recommend it .
I didn't realize that my body stopped making what I need as I got older. Hopeful this will help me as much as I want it to .
I have carried this knife for medium duty for two years, the AUS8 steel sharpens easy and will easily take an edge sharp enough to shave with, and with regular stropping you can maintain that edge for months before touching up. the blade geometry and full flat grind makes this knife one of the most kick ass EDC knifes i have ever owned, strong lock up, fast deploying, good thumb stud, ultra lite weight and comfortable deep carry pocket clip, its always there when i need it. if you want a ultra strong pry bar type knife this is not for you, but if you want a nimble knife that is capable of whimsically slicing through what ever ails you, its a solid choice.side note; if you don't mind voiding your warranty and possibly losing floor soluble screws in the carpet for all of eternity thus making your new knife garbage, the safety bar can be removed easily.(I really don't recommend this and don't blame me if you can't put it back together)unfold the knife so that tension is off the coil spring, i repeat make sure the knife is OPEN, unscrew all hex type screws and VERY, VERY carefully lift the safety side handle scale off, trying not to allow the blade to be dislodged from the main thicker scale. then lift out the safety bar leaving the pin in place and screw the cover back on, your done .
really makes cleaning the gas piston miles easier and it works great, built solid to last a life time. nothing special to say about the drill bits, they are correct size and length with nice aluminum handles that are built quality, exactly what you need.Without the wrench i felt like i was going to break the rifle getting the gas plug out because i just couldn't get the leverage where i needed it, its nice thick 1/2&#34; aluminum and didn't mar or leave any marks. literally cleaned the gas piston, tube and cylinder in five minutes or less at a leisurely pace. very happy with this purchase .
its an okay dump/drop pouch. it works fine but the materials quality is a little shotty and i fear the stitching will fail sometime down the road. you can get quality US pouches for about the same price but this should work fine if its the look your after. im personally abusing the heck out of this pouch and so far its holding up. probably would not buy again but don't regret it .
I really liked this game. It's a lot easier to play than its predecessor. My only issue is that sometimes it doesn't work write if I have my kindle held a certain way .
I am currently enrolled in AP United States History in high school; which is the reason why I read this book. Most of the information I read from this book was stuff I had never heard off. It gives incite on the main contributors in the start of America. It sums up the political differences and major agreements made, as in finical and the location of the capital. Also, one of the main focuses was on the relationship between John Adams and Thomas Jefferson, and how their friendship was destroyed for a while because of their political differences. In my opinion, the book focused a lot on the political differences between all of the founding brothers which even led to death. But I'm trying not to give out any spoilers.Being a teenager, I found this book boring at times because it is filled with information and contains words that I have never heard of before. However, It did make me understand more about what happened after the American Revolution and the shaping of the nation. I found the chapters about the duel between Aaron Burr and Alexander Hamilton and George Washington's Farewell Address most interesting. Also, the fact that John Adams' wife, Abigail Adams, was a main political adviser to her husband and told him to kept in mind of the women in the nation was very interesting to me. I would recommend this book to anyone that wants to know the most important events and discussion made after the American Revolution. Also, if you are trying to understand a little more about the roles of the founding fathers, then this is an excellent book for you .
I have not yet completed the entire book so a full review is too early to give. From what I have read to this point I believe it will be helpful in our pastor search .
Case was as described. Still reviewing the case , only have used it for a short time. Clear screen protector did not go on well, looking for better option .
If you don't have a AUX/USB port and rely only on the CD's / FM... It's for you..It is working well as of now, Seems to be good quality product .
Best job in those days of limited technology....Spielberg has always amazed people n he still does that no doubt.... the fat kid is an add on I really wanna know thatall those kids are super stars now .
its cheap and not at all usable ...total waste of money ...i have one from office max which looks amazing and very durable ...thought it would be the same but my bad i see the price is also cheap but atleast it got be usable ..but its not .
I bought a cheaper one and it does not work, I returned it, this one worked. I recommended it to my friends .
I am completely satisfied with the product. It works properly and has fast internet access.I recommend it, you won't waste your money .
Very good product, if you don't feel ok typing on screen this keybord will be very helpful.You'll feel your  BB playbook is a mini-laptop .
Very good product, if you don't feel ok typing on screen this keybord will be very helpful.You'll feel your BB playbook is a mini-laptop .
I love the stones that I received. They're very pretty and they're all different. I was upset that I didn't at least get a list of the 7 stones that I got though. Even if I had to look up all the names on the list and match them with the stone, it would have been nice. I knew what most of my stones were already, but there is one I am stumped on and I can't seem to figure it out. That identification card would have been nice. But overall I am satisfied. :] I would order again, but only after they told me what I got in my bag. Otherwise, you might as well buy them all separately so you know for sure what you are getting .
I got this gift for my girlfriend for her birthday, it may not have been much but she felt like it was everything she could ask for. It turned out to be her very favorite gift age received; one because it came from me haha. But really because the girl has taste in accessories. Very satisfied .
This product is terrible it's ends bubble up with a case on it not to mention my screen looks textured even though I followed directions to a T. Do not buy this product save your money for a better product .
I am glad they catch major and maria,I hope they lock them up and throw away the key...Can't wait to see part three .
Very nice....very satisfied n love that i could find a cover since us cellular isn't selling the aviators any more .
Purchased this rifle after some extensive research.  I had purchased a couple of rifles locally and returned both of them because they would not shoot with any accuracy. This rifle is not only powerful, but once zeroed in - is very accurate .
I bought this lamp in october of 12 and on 3-1-13 was watching tv and heard something explode in the back of my tv and instantly knew what it was.... I pull the lamp out and it had burst into a bunch of pieces on the inside of the bulb. So this lamp didn't last 6months. So you get what you pay for. I paid almost $30.00 in shipping to get it the next day so I could watch my tv. Amazon couldn't help me because it was past 30 days since I ordered it. They gave me the number to pure glare the people that made it so hopefully they will make it right. So I would not recommend anyone buy this lamp .
will be deleting this app, i downloaded it and it won;t let us do anything.  I have tried and tried to play and all it does is ask if i want to buy.  No i don;t want to buy something if I can;t first see what its about .
free version not much fun.  going be deleting it, all it will let you do is play the piano and put a small piano puzzle together (same puzzle everytime .
I'm a mom of 4... and I can't tell you how many bibs/brands I've gone through. I don't know how I didn't know about these or see them before but wish I did I would have saved so much money in bibs.Pros:Wipes up or washes super easilyDries quickly or wipes dry in time of next snack/feedingEasy to get on/off - no Velcro or snaps; but stays on if little ones tugAdjusts - fits my baby, 2 yr old and 3 yr oldThe pocket actually stays open and catches the foodSo far hasn't stained (even after spaghetti night)Durable - well made; worth paying more and not having to replace after a few months like other bibsI would use other bibs and would rinse or wash them in the machine and air dry only to find in time I would see mold spots forming or stains. Also on other bibs the "pocket" wouldn't really stay open and didn't do it's job of catching the food.They did look small when I first opened the box but tried them anyway and was very pleased .
The book was alright but not as fast paced as I had hoped it would be. I may read another but not right away .
Realistic and seemed historically correct in most aspects. Held my interest from start to finish. I would not hesitate to recommend this book .
This machine works great. I wish they had more defualt setup or user define learnig mode setup. control buttons would not allow time setup. it is set to 10 minutes. I strongly urge everyone to buy it. space saver for sure .
Dick Francis is always a 'good bet' - that is, one can always be sure that his work is always of the highest quality. Language is &#34;clean&#34; while not in any way diminishing the rigours of an encounter. Not many writers understand that good writing should not rely on filthy speech and explicit sex to hold the attention of a reader .
The work is exceedingly well researched and I found nothing to 'complain' about! The writer is rational, well read, and by long years of observation of others and their views, brings a well balanced and plausable attitude to the subject. And, I agree with him!!!headline .
The book presents an authentic report!Truth cannot be 'coloured up' in flowery language. It stands the test and, so does this text .
I would strongly encourage anyone who has issues with addiction to read this - take it to heart - and do something about it!  Before it's to late!  There are ways to change and improve lives for everyone involved.I was hesitant to purchase and read this book.  I have for years &#34;denied&#34; there was a problem.  Figured &#34;it will get better tommorrow&#34; &#34;I don't want to rock the boat&#34; &#34;I don't want to deal with this&#34;.Unfortunatley when you read a book and most of what it is saying &#34;Hits You Between the Eyes & Pierces your HEART&#34;you had better do something about the issue.  Even if you are the only one who will change.  The longer the alcoholic continues the bigger the battle .
Got this bag for a 17.3" MSI laptop, and I'm very happy with this bag. The bag fits my laptop like a glove, and there are plenty of other pockets I can use for my charger and USB mouse. Someone said that the front flap deforms when you use the handhold, and I can confirm that; I never use that though, so not a problem for me. Very comfortable bag as well .
Just got these headphones about a month ago, and overall I'm pretty happy with them... I'm not an audiophile, but for the average audio consumer/casual listener like myself, these headphones give great sound for a great price! I also love their durability and simple design, as well as its portability, the way it can fold up for easy carrying on the go. The only problems I've had with it are slight discomfort at the top, like others have noted, and another thing that I have not seen others note in their reviews: my cables became faulty after the first few weeks of use, so now I have to bend the cable a little bit for it to transmit signal to my laptop. I'm going to try out a coiled cable from Mediabridge, so that should be the end of that problem soon... Which leads me to another thing I'm very happy with about these headphones: replaceable cables! I've always had a problem with headphone cables breaking, and with these I don't have to buy a whole new pair just because the cable broke.TL;DR: Great sound, good price, maybe not the most comfortable all the time and not the most durable cables, but easy to replace. Overall, happy with product, but some room for improvement. Thanks, Monoprice .
Hard to use and don't work, the mixture is the worst part of the product  and the warnings on the label makes you scared to use it .
I was fooled by the brand. The watch is very heavy not suitable for average folks. The swatch strap is of the lowest quality, one of those made in China stuff. I decided to return it on the very first day .
I was satisfied with this slim drive until it failed within the first 3 months of using it. And my patience has been tested since then. I've been trying to get another one under my warranty but it's been almost 2 weeks since the first time I tried to get hold of the seagate customer service and I still have not received a new one!!The wait on the phone is ridiculously long. The first time I called them, I was on hold for over an hour to talk to someone briefly. More than a week ago, the manager talked to me saying that a new one would finally be shipped to me. When I called them again after waiting for more than a week, I was told that it hasn't been shipped. And every time I talk to a customer rep, they blame on system update.I'm thinking about just not getting warranty and switching to another brand. I feel like even if I get a new seagate drive, it will fail again and I don't want to waste my time doing this again .
Like the escapism ofSnaggler's Paradise (Wickedly funny... Mark Rainstone Reviews)(recommended) the Average American Marriage takes a look at the pitfalls of modern day marriage. A good insider's book that offers up some laughs and gut instinct, not to mention testosterone, in today's society. A good read .
I have not read books 1 & 2 and I was worried about reading the third book in the series without books 1 & 2. I told myself that I;d read 50 - 60 pages and If I was having hard time following along, I'd go back and read books 1 & 2 first. The next thing I knew, I was 125 pages into the story and enjoying it.Danica has created an amazing world full of shifters, nymphs and demigods that keep you engaged from cover to cover. My heart ached for Harper, but I quickly grew fond of her, which makes a story easier for me to read and keep reading. This story is full of romance and action and the suspense of finding out what happens next keeps you turning page after page. I do look forward to more from Danica Winter's Nymph Series.I received a copy from the author in exchange for my honest review .
I am completely in love with this book and this series - nothing has captured my attention like Georgia Cates has in this BEAUTIFUL Series - Almost done with book 2 and I don't want this series to END! Highly Highly Recommended .
This story contains it all:  well-developed characters, action, and a nice dose of romance.  The creatures include Shifters who are more science fiction than paranormal, ghouls who burn, and two wonderful dragons.  I can't wait to read book 2 .
I can't say enough about this movie - was sad I could download it, but so glad I bought it .
I really liked how this is a book built on the possibilities of tomorrow. It has that dystopia feel because of what caused the war, but it's different because there are no zombies walking around- well, minus the ghouls - which I prefer to zombies. Can't wait to see what happens in book 2 .
I had a hard time getting into this book, but once I was inside, I really started to enjoy it. Artemis is really trying to find a way to take over the throne from Zeus, which leads her to seek the help of others in finding a way to do so. I'm very interested to see where this story goes from here and can't wait for book 2.Note: I received this book in exchange for my honest review .
I have to say, I'm not a big YA Fan, but I love fantasy, so it was a great combination of both.  I really enjoyed Broken Spell. I love how Fabio kept me turning the page because I just had to know what was going to happen next.  Fabio has a brilliant way of bringing out the personality of his characters, Skye and Drake, not to mention the ability for us to see who is speaking.Fabio not only has amazing character development, but does a great job with suspense. Just when I thought I was going to put it down, something else would happen, and I'd keep on reading.If you love a good YA, regardless of your age, I recommend checking out the Singularity Series. I give Broken Spell 4 Fab Stars!***Note*** I was provided a copy of this book in exchange for my honest review .
Perfect fit for the Lumix 5. The originals made by Panasonic for the Lumix DMC LX5 are sometimes hard to find so I was lucky. Most 3rd party accessories do not fit as well .
Exactly what I wanted it to be! Not too small but not too big either. The leather/fabric is great, too .
My phone is very snug inside he case but it doesn't block the camera which could have been a problem. Love using it as my wallet when I don't want to carry a big purse for only a few credit cards and cash .
My iPad fits perfectly and it stands up very well. most won't keep the iPad vertical but this one does. Loving the pockets on the inside as well .
Love the thickness so it won't break too easily. There aren't any small fragile bars near the volume buttons which makes it so much easier to switch cases when I want to .
Thin but not too thin to where it will break. Easy to take on and off without breaking my nails which is always a plus for us girls .
Purchased for a class I was taking.  The book was pretty good, not one of my favorites.  The CD followed the book very closely so I dint miss out on any information there .
Product was as described no more no less.  I use them all the time and have had no problems with them .
I have never used these types of tablets before so my expectations may be too high.  I used the tablets and drank the water did not get sick so I assume they worked.  However they make the water taste awful and I will try to find another method to purify water on my next hiking trip .
These balls are about what you can expect for the price.  I don't think they effect my game at all as I am only an occasional golfer but for someone to whom the ball matters I would pass .
I really like this bag, it is heavier canvas and that is why I purchased it.  I like the number of pockets and the over all design.  It loses a star because It does not have a place to attach a sleeping bag so you have to get creative if your planing more than a tow nigh trip (The sleeping bag will fit inside but takes up most of the room)  It loses another start because of a faulty zipper on the pouch on the top of the bag.  In all fairness I did not report this to the seller as I an not that concerned about that zipper .
Product is good, you get what you see.  This is not a WWII era helm, you can tell this by the M52 (52 standing for the year in which the first one was produced)  Overall nice Helm for the price .
Very poor product.  Did not work at all.  Informed seller and they replaced it for free but again the second one also did not work.  I cut my losses and went to the store to buy a new one and that one worked fine .
Bought this as a gift.  And she loved the design and color fits a pair of glasses very nicely and not to tight you have to worry about breakage but not so lose your glasses will slide all over like a babies rattle .
Product is nice and fits sr9c ok, but was clearly not made specifically for the gun.  The extra mag pouch is a nice bonus tho .
This new plastic board works great especially now that my game set is a little older and my pieces start to bow.  Before having this board I would have to spend extra time setting up the game due to the cardboard edges.  The only down side is that it will not work with any expansion that have multiple hexes stuck together such as the Rivers of Catan expansion.  I love my new board .
I cannot believe the ending to this series, or that I wasted my time reading the first two books and waiting months for the third one to come out. I'm all for the unexpected and know that not everything can wrapped up with ribbons and bows but come on! Roth really dropped the ball with this one. As previously mentioned, the POV changing was confusing and there was no real difference between Tris' POV and Four's POV, it was like reading the same person throughout the entire book. The ending was not an ending, it was a sudden halt, a freight train that slams to a still and never begins forward motion again, it seemed a lazy way to end the book by having her taken out by a character we barely learned anything about it was poorly constructed and poorly executed .
This is a great choice and you can't really beat the prices at Atlantis. Way to go guys you are my go to when it comes to hydro .
I bought it but can't figure out how to download it to read on my tablet ive tried everything and still cant figure it out its there just cant read it .
I purchased these six months ago and just recently installed them.  Three weeks ago, anyways, they sounded great but now they are buzzing and they sound awful.  Don't waste your money save and buy better ones.  I will never buy from Pyle ever again. And I hope you don't either .
Looked good and came fast but it broke when putting it on my phone didn't know why but i looked closer and it was smaller than my phone, the end didnt fit oh well .
It was perfect,just as described it came fast too it suits me style and needs at the same time.you won't regret buying it .
hORRIBLE i hate them i got them and they were perfect and i loved them till they broke 4 days later I WILL NEVER BUY ITEMS FROM THIS SELLER.AND YOU SHOULDNT EITHER .
christen cmust not have seen the new packaging. Don't give up yet! The company has decided to change the packaging from a pump top to a squeezable bottle. The design allows for 100% usage. I am a bodycare buyer for a major health food store and we started seeing the new packaging before the end of Oct. 2012. I am hooked on this WHOLE line. I can recommend this line for people with aging skin, acne skin, and super sensitive skin. I have had little to no returns on this line, along with COUNTLESS WOMEN (ages 20 and up!)coming back to my store to find me and tell me how happy they are that I found them a product that replaces and surpasses their super expensive products. I am able to save them money and get them a better product. How cool .
My sweet boyfriend gave this to me for Heart's Day, & I absolutely love it! I couldn't stop staring at it, so beautiful! It's simple & elegant, it was perfect .
The sunscreen is PERFECT if you need to wear sunscreen everyday. I usually find that regular sunscreen is too heavy under my make-up and makes my foundation look really obvious and uneven.  This stuff not only blends evenly and smoothly, but my skin is starting to feel a heck of a lot softer too. I want to find out what retail stores carry this .
Like the item but the adjustable thread has come undone.  Had to tie in a knot to keep it from unraveling .
I couldn't put it down. It was very good need more by this author.read it way to fast.love it.love it .
Snowpants were xxx large not xx.They were so huge I took them apart and tried to alter. I just screwed them up and threw them out. What a waste of money .
I'm happy with it. The price was good for king size mattress pad.These are not easy to find at this price .
Looked and saved for these boots for months. The first day I wore them sole came undone and 3 bands broke. Manufacture needs to look into the quality of this boot before shipping. Very disappointed would not recommend .
Ring wasn't up to my expectations. I really wanted it, it was so cute.Fell apart immediately and company made things right. Will do business with this company again .
Book had no plot just sex, read half of book . Had to stop before I got sick to my stomach .
It didn't not work at all cause I could not see my screen at all so I took it off my phone .
When I received this, I couldn't believe the detail, and the quality in the making.  It sure will last for a life time .
I bought this set to replace the filter that came with my pitcher.After 2 weeks' use of one of the filters, there are still small black particles in the water, which I didn't have with my original filter.I'm hoping other filters would work better .
I brought this book for my nephew and he loved it. He can't wait for next book in the series to come in the fall .
I ordered this case because I pretty much have an Iphone case addiction:)! I am constantly changing my phone cases and I never leave one on for too long. When I got this case I fell in love! I like how it covers the edges on the front so it kind of protects it. I received so many compliments and left it on for a long time .
Phone was submerged for about 10 seconds (in the sink). When I pulled it out, and turned it on, I could not make out the screen.  I put it in the "Yikes!" rescue bag, waited 12 hours, and it works again!It was really easy, I just follow the instructions on the back of the package .
Good but they don't show that it only has the bevel on one side making it hardish for right handed people to wlddle with .
I bought this for a longboard bearings and I love the small injection injector tip the oil and it makes my bearings really fast and keeps them not squeaking .
I purchased this kindle in November for my Foster child knowing she wanted a laptop and it got me thinking why get her that when I know exactly what she uses a computer for so when I checked the spec for this kindle HD it was a no brainer for my 14 year old best electronic I bought her this year .
I wish I had discovered this product years ago. I will probably have a blepharoplasty some day. But till then, these are fantastic! I had no trouble peeling off the white backing and applying. They last all day long, and I love getting such a large supply at a reasonable price. To whoever invented these: THANK YOU! And thank you to the seller for the pricing and the quick delivery .
This was not my favorite season the first time through, but it really grew on me. Great individual episodes, and Martha is an awesome companion if you can get over her not being Billie Piper. Don't miss Smith and Jones, Blink, or Human Nature .
Pretty cool for what it was. I laughed a few times. If you like comic movies, I imagine you will like this.  I hadn't seen the movies leading up to this, but I was able to catch on quick enough .
I bought two if these for my children (age 8).  They have had Nooks for a year but they were starting to look a little beat up. I love my otterbox for my phone, so this seemed like a great idea. I don't know what type of Nook this is supposed to fit, but it doesn't fit the color, the tablet, the HG, the HG + or the Simple Touch. If you have a different Nook than one I just listed, it is probably an awesome product. If not, don't waste your time .
I still haven't revecived it!! If I knew that it would take this long I would never have bought it .
I had a toothbrush sanitizer before, from another company and it was smaller.  so when I was on the search for a new one and couldn't find it from the last company, found it here.  I like it.  I have it attached to wall with the sticker tape it came with and I use the plug .
I love this app. It not only keeps me busy but my children busy also:) I recommend it to anyone and everyone. It's fun for all age groups .
I ordered this to save my laptop from getting scratches. It does the job, but I have so many unattractive air bubbles I could not get out because it was hard to apply .
My case is definitely cute, but it is a piece of junk. The paint chipped, on the second day, IN MY POCKET. I've had it for four days now and looks like I've had it for the last five years. Not pleased. At. All .
i just got into the business of making crafts out of molds and i guess i can say not very knowledgeable.i poured resin into the mold  and destroyed the mold. but as far as the mold goes  it was nice .
this was ordered for my great grandson.. it was perfect  for what he needed it worked fine with no problems  i would buy it again .
the product was ok.  it was a smaller amount than i thought it would be. but noyhing was wrong with the product but i would not order that small amount again .
i ordered this to weigh all my new born puppies.  the pups are 9 weeks old . this scale has been a life saver and very handy. it is accurate according to the vet scales. i don't like the fact that you have to add up all the oz, or raise it up and click the button .  the button should have been on top. i would reccomend it.  its very reliable .
Usually, people don't buy clothes online because of fitting issues.This was pretty nice both in fit and comfort. Its soft and airy. GreatFor summers .
This product Only took care of the fleas not the worms....I liked this product I just wish it took care of the worms as well .
Charming paints a deliciously naughty experience for the reader in this book! As always his words flow seductively and make you wish the story never ends! I do hope to see a sequel as Ariana is certainly a dirty little minx .
As always I loved it! I'm emotionally exhausted, I laughed, cried and then got horny. Houseguest and I need to discuss the ins and outs of pegging in more depth; I need some lessons! Can't wait for your next release! Congrats Baby! xoxo .
While I am a new fan of the Sci-Fi genre I know what I like, and I like this author&#8217;s writing style. His ability to write engaging, disarming and immersive prose is nothing short of brilliant. Mr. Jones&#8217; writing, in my opinion, is reminiscent Orson Scott Card, however I truly feel he will surpass Mr. Card as my favourite Sci-Fi Author. I look forward to reading much more of this story.I also located Mr.Jones' blog at http://richjonesblog.wordpress.com .
Quite happy with the quality, durability, Sheen of fabric after washing, The weight is perfect w/a blanket! So often w/comforters,there is no sense of weight .
I ordered the 2 tone colored one as an add on fee shipping item.. when I received it, it was a solid brown. Not the one I ordered. I asked them if I was able to exchange it for the correct item, and they wanted to charge me for shipping. The shipping was the same price if the item! Not good .
I thought the book was very good. it had a lot twist and turn to the story. I was sadden what had happen at the end. its too bad the kid had to find theirs parent dead this way. The girl she reminded me of Nancy Drew. But I did enjoyed the book .
this book is so good. I could not put it down. I thought it had good story plot, and also it keep you not to stop reading .
I love it. it has good story and plot keeps you don't want to put the book down. I do enjoyed it very much .
i thought this was a lego puzzle. i am very disappointed. i should not have order. sorry it was mistake .
I just almost finished. I can not put it down. its soo good. I had to stop.its a type of book you can not put it down. I soo much enjoyed reading. it has a lot twist and turns to the story .
It does no function as advertised.  There is no twenty five mile range.  It s like using a coat hanger with tin foil to catch reception .
I hate it, be very careful and watch the misleading pictures displayed on amazon.com, no rear camera and front camera is very poor quality, worse than old web cams, in any light .
After going back-and-forth with UPS regarding this shipment,  I finally picked it up today. I am very disappointed that Amazon shipped the wrong USB cable. This isn't a micro-USB cable. They sent me USB cable for a printer. It is clearly a human error on their end.  The hassle I went through UPS just to get the wrong cable. Anyways, I called Mediabridge and immediately routed to a voicemail. I expect them to mail me what I ordered ASAP.UPDATE 10/02/2013: So Mediabridge returned my call and they were trying to refer me to call Amazon regarding this error. Funny thing is I did call Amazon first and they referred me to them. I didn't feel like arguing over $6 dollars so I just agreed to return the wrong cable. Minutes after the call ended, I received an email from Mediabridge telling me they will ship the correct USB I ordered for free. I guess problem solved .
This game is really fun and tests your knowledge and is very hard at same times because you don't know some artists .
Hilarious! If you don&#8216;t like farting this is not your book. But if you can appreciate a good gass here you go! Too funny! Kids had a blast reading it .
First of, this author writing style is very confusing. Often times I couldn't who was saying what.Secondly I find the 30year old main character quite childish. She's basically an alcoholic slut that is sleeping with two men at once. It was a pretty stupid story that was badly written and I wouldn't recommend it .
If it was worth it I would have returned it. Cheaply made, color is off so it doesn't match the real stuff .
Space screen is great the others not so great. You go to curve your ball an it will disappear and sreen will freeze. Other than that I like the game .
I would not recommend this game. It does not compare to argry birds. I probably will delete it. sorry Steve .
Such an amazing book. Its one of those reads where you finish the first paragraph and you're hooked. I may have finished this whole thing in 3 sittings. Not only was his journey amazing to read about, but the way its all laid out in front of us through these chapters is amazing. I highly recommend this  read .
The guts of my current newest xbox controller did not fit into this thing.. It's cheaply made and was a waste of money, I took a gamble and lost,  attempts to contacts the seller have failed.. Was only 9 bucks so I havnt even opened a complaint with amazon .
The T-Shirt I purchased irritated my skin and after several washes is still not comfortable.  I would not recommend this product .
as a young man i found this to be a great insight into the mind of a young woman. Simply they want to experience life. Be apart of the adventure not the adventure itself .
Made no difference. Complete waste of money. Won't be duped into this again....lol. Would not recommend this to anyone. Don't waste your money. Just go in and hang out with your plants a little each day. You will exhale more CO2 than these stupid things....lol. GARBAGE .
Package arrived in a timely manner. Everything was as I expected, not great quality, but functional...exactly what I paid less for. The hood is a lot cheaper than I expected, but I can't complain. It seems to reflect light well enough. I'm not fancy enough to have lumen meters and such' but my plants seem to be happy and thrive under this light. Only problem I had was that I was short 16 nuts....yes, 16....ridiculous! Lucky for me the local Ace hardware is right down the street. Didn't bother complaining. If they can't get it right the first time, odds are, it will take a while to remedy it. I was up and running despite being short suppied. One star lost for that reason. Ballast makes a bit of a buzzing nose, but it reminds me of a light my grandparents had outside on their farm when i was a kid that buzzed the same way, so it doesn't bother me much...lol. I waited three months to write this as basically, it has taken about this long for it to pay for itself. Well, it has and I hope it brings back many returns. I would recommend this setup .
I have read this series from the beginning and haven't missed a beat.Love hope and faith is all u need in life and these books express it all .
It was hard to. Follow the story line at times and did not grab and hold you like contingency did but it was good .
I got this dvd in the mail and it took a really long time. It was the first one i ordered and the last one i received.When i put it into the dvd player it would not work. I thought it may have been my dvd player so i put it in several different players but it still would not play in any of them. I do not know what is wrong with the dvd but we were really looking foward to seeing this movie again as it is one of our favorites.I'm not looking for a refund at all but would like another Baby Boy dvd that actually works.thank you,Ashley Conant .
I love reading Catherine Anderson. This one kept me on edge like all the others.  Can't wait to read the next one .
The newest iteration of Game Genie which is now for PS3 is decent in it's setup and design, but compared to code systems of old such as Game Shark or Action Replay, there seems to be alot less you can do with it not to mention there's alot more restrictions placed on it.  It's good for what it is which is nothing more than a glorified game save editor and save resigner, but it's got nothin on the oldies .
It works great, I have an older teacup chihuahua that can't walk as far anymore and he loves going byebye in his sexy new stroller .
I could not get the game to work and the GArden one I just purchased does not work either.  I would like a refund .
I got my haircut on vacation at Nine Zero One salon in West Hollywood. LOVED the product UNITE that they used but couldn't purchase it there because of my carry on only bag. LOVE this product. Got my hair short and choppy and since have been trying to find a great beach spray that comes close to what was used on me at the time of my cut. LOVE it and the 7 second detangler too. Will def buy the shampoo/conditioner next .
This came to me very fast I was very happy with that. Good condition and works fantastic considering I have already dropped my phone with this on a million times. Yes it is bulky but I don't care as long as my phone is protected and thats what it does .
This is, in my opinion, their best album. The album is spectacular from start to finish. It's got great orchestral sounds as well as amazing riffs. If you have not listened to CoF before. this is the best album to start with .
Cord won't charge. I also tried 10 different phones an tablets but the cord won't display. Not a good product .
At times, this book reminded me of The Game by Neil Strauss. Like pea-cocking, I believe being a bad boy is finding that edge about yourself and embracing it. The author talks about his lucky experiences with women. He is one lucky man - not necessarily every approachable woman has a girlfriend work as a VIP host at the restaurant row on La Cienega.I gave a 5 star because it is easy reading. He says listen to your woman, be genuinely interested in her, give without expectations. They all are good relationship advise .
I like the case but it was a tight fit to get it on getting it off is easy just not going on .
This is a great product that works as advertised. I was expecting a few more bells and whistles though. But on reflection what more do you need if it recharges and extend the charge like promised? It makes the phone a bit bigger (obviously) but not a lot bigger than my other battery case but it is worth it when you need a longer charge. I would have preferred a more textures finish to give more grip but it is adequate. Overall a good product .
I just got this delivered earlier today morning via Fedex. Package was in a padded envelope, would've preferred a box. Was replacing a 2.5" Toshiba 160GB 5400rpm hard drive in my mid 2009 MacBook Pro 13" (with 8gb of RAM). My laptop is only compatible with SATA II (3gbit/s transfer) and not SATA III (6gbit/s) - this SSD drive is SATA III, but is backward compatible with SATA II as well. Installation of the SSD drive was pretty simple, had to remove the bottom lid and four t6 torx screws from the HDD itself. Fired up the laptop and started the install of Mac OS X Leopard. I had to format the SSD drive first, so that Mac OSX would be able to recognize the ssd drive. After OSX was installed, i started to test the speediness. Boot up time from hitting the power on button used to be 53 seconds with the Toshiba HDD and now is 14 seconds flat (SSD) till I see my desktop! I'm real satisfied with the drop in time for a cold boot up. I use my laptop mostly for VMWare and Excel spreadsheet work. A virtualized Windows XP machine now takes about 41 seconds to boot with the SSD, while the Toshiba HDD took about 57 seconds. Opening an Excel spreadsheet for the very first time (after boot up) with the SSD takes about 3.5 seconds, it took about 16 seconds with the Toshiba HDD (after boot up as well) - big jump in speed! I listen to Pandora a lot on Firefox and was hoping that Adobe Flash, which is utilized predominantly by the site, would function better, but alas it does not - still causes occasional stuttering. I suppose an SSD can't alleviate much of that frustration. Firing up Mozilla Firefox 3 is near instantaneous, though it was speedy earlier as well. I did happily notice that when i quit out of Firefox while Pandora is playing, it's instant - used to take ~2 seconds before (annoyed me back then). I'm not seeing too many 'rainbow wheels' so far, but that could be alluded to the clean OSX install - that's normal for all new operating system installs. Since this drive is only 64gb in size, one should get it if they intend to install only their operating system/mission critical applications on it - large videos/music should be kept on either an external USB drive or a regular platter based HDD. I myself still have about 30gbs left after copying my important documents and (1) virtual machine. Prices for SSD drives are still very expensive @ $2.00/gb, whereas a regular HDD is about $0.11/gb as of today. Only four stars due to the high price! Hope this review helped, please feel free to comment with questions .
I love this case, I have only completely run the battery out once since I received this product. so I think it uses an android type charger, if you get in a bind you can remove the case and just charge the phone as usual with an ipod cord. So in the morning I unplug it and you have to hold the on button on the battery case to shut off the charge mode, if you don't it starts charging your phone right away. It seems to add about another half charge of my battery when I turn it on, great for gaming or traveling. One pain I encountered, I play a lot of sand vball and sand ended up inside the case, I had to open it up to get it out because it was rattling around. Went back together fine, the top piece holds the main two bodies halves together .
Packaging: Packaging from Razer is phenomenal as always. I had no worries about this in transit. The Box amazon use to ship the keyboard in was the perfect length, not a 100% fit but they added these air packets.Functionality: This being a keyboard aimed at gamers does what it advertises. I can fully programme all the keys to be macros or whatever i like. They added 5 extra keys which comes in handy. The mechanical keys are loud and if your looking for something to play at night with everyone sleeping, not the best choice right here. However, i can recommend the stealth edition. The keys are narrower and will take some getting used to time but once you use it, you will never want to go back to a membrane keyboard. The passthrough USB and audio input and output come very handy for me as i am always taking files in and out of my computer. Cleaning the Blackwidow is so much easier to clean then a membrane keyboard and i had many problems with that. (Taking the keys out to clean the undersection)Design: The design is magnificent. It's slick and an eye-catcher. It fits a gamer's crib perfectly. The LED lights can be blindingly bright and can be pin-point adjusted to suit your environment. The matte finish is great and a huge improvement from the previous versions of the blackwidow. However, i like my equipment in tip-top shape and if you have sweaty hand like i do, it doesn't get fingerprints but more of a dark smudge. I often find myself with a damp cloth wiping away the mess every-now and then. Personally, i don't think it's THAT bad to be a deal-breaker. It is very well built hefty and sturdy. Weighs a decent weight so it won't move around on your table in those desperate moments.Drivers: I think the drivers could be improve, before i installed the drivers i tested its functionality and the backlighting would change in an instant. With the drivers installed the backlighting would take an extra second to change it's profile. Other then that the drivers are very well presented and easy to use.Conclusion: If your looking for an eye-catcher and an upgrade for your cheap membrane keyboard you stole from work. This is the whole package. If you can get this on sale it's a must have and should not be looked past. however i don't recommend you get this at full price, it's just there are so many more functional keyboard out there for a lesser price .
uNu Exera Duo Charging Dock just comes up for a few week, so not too much people know about this and it's not that much product review on it. I know this case it's a very good design, that I write a review for it. This case can keep my iPhone battery on all the time, when one battery die I can change another battery on it. This case is very good for some people who like travelling all the time. Like me, Even though I travelling all over the world I still can connect my family anytime. Thank you uNu inventing this item. It make my life much easier .
I always have some sort of warranty on my iPhone but ive been searching for a case that is very thin but adds no bulk to the phone. Basically only to keep it from scratching. I hate that you can't see the apply sign on most cases. This one hit both nails on the head. The snap on case EXTREMELY THIN and shows the apple sign on the back. When you need the battery, just snap it on and ready to go, very nice concept .
fits perfect great buy for the money. i might just buy another one in another color. but it doesn't come with the pin .
The word &#34;page turner&#34; may not be an appropriate way of describing this very personal journey of getting an autistic child. Nevertheless, I could not put the book away and was completely absorbed by the story - it was like actually being there myself and experiencing the feelings of Noahs mother. I do not have any autistic relatives myself, but I am sure that this book will provide hope, understanding, and energy to people with autistic relatives. It is also a story of endless love, trust, hope and more endless love which is inspiring no matter if you are parents of an autistic child or not. I am looking forward to the next book about Noah and his family .
I had never heard of akir before buying this album but I am deffinately glad I did. Great flow and lyrics .
This is the replacement we have been using for years now. The push button is great and makes it easy to install. Only down fall is it doesn't help with hard water .
I purchased 2 of these products from asavings. The main problem is that the cover doesn't fit the kindle model - Keyboard Kindle 3G + wifi. There is a mismatch between the groves on the kindle where the hooks are supposed to fit in and the placement of the hooks on the cover. The groves on the kindle are 4 inches apart and the covers hooks are less than 4 inches apart.Someone should be checking the design changes, if any, before they are put out to sell. The courier charges to return these products from my country are more than the product costs. That's a lot of inconvenience for me!... and a totally unnecessary one .
I first saw this movie early early last year and was blown away! When I found it here, I just had to buy it! You really need to watch this movie and just experience it! It is WEIRD, but a very good weird. Nicole Kidman and Robert Downey Jr. are both incredible in this film. I wonder why I had never heard of this film until early last year? Strange .
Well, this plug is just fantastic and my girlfriend and I are just ecstatic about our purchase! Nothing beats the smoothness and weight of this plug when its inside you. And the circular base is just perfect for simply putting it in and leaving it there to walk around and go about your day. Normally there's a little bit of chafing and discomfort brought on by the bases of most butt-plugs but not with this one! It is soooo comfortable leaving nothing "butt" fullness and arousal to be felt!Just perfect for an experienced, happy, healthy butt! Or pussy, this toy does not discriminate... LOL .
Super fun, great sound effects and I love that you can change up the appearance if you like. The only draw back is you can't adjust the sensitivity for better game play .
I love these, they are good quality, they sparkle soo much, and just look awesome. If you want some BLING, these are for you. I have been looking for a pair of gauges like this for a while, and these are perfect, my favorite. I where 5/8ths and they are not too heavy, comfortable, and I really like that they scre on, so as not able to lose to easliy outta your ears .
THE HOSE WERE GREAT EXCEPT THAT &#34;ONE SIZE FITS ALL&#34; WAS TOO LONG FOR ME.  COULDN'T YOU PRODUCE THESE IN SMALL, MEDIUM, AND LARGE .
If all you are looking for is extra dice, these will do. As for quality of dice, they are sub-par. A lot of the paint seems to be just slopped on or chipping off. There seems to be no set amount of each type, my order came with gratuitous amounts of 4d's and 00d's, while lacking in 20d's. Like I said before, good to just have around if you need quick replacements or extra's that you won't mind losing .
Just love this clan does not matter if we are not blood we are still family and that gets my respect. Just started to read her books and love them all .
I could not put this book down it was amazing fantastic such a great read friendship family love what can I say but amazing 10 stars!!!!!! Love the whole series .
Now this is what your call a great read. I just love how she completed the story we did not have buy a next book to finished it. I would recommend this book it's raw dam it's raw, but I would not have it any other way I loved it 10 plus star amazing .
I have read all her books at least three times and I can say I love them all but this one I think was the best yet omg  can't wait to read your next books this was amazing love them all .
All I have to say this was the best book ever so deep and honest I could not of wait to see what happened with every chapter I read it was just so amazing,I was shock I laughed, cried sad this was just so amazing love .
Well I was not expecting to love this as much as I did. It truly keep me laughing so much that I read it twice love the characters the friendships family it was amazzzing. It had its sad moments but overall it was beautiful.  That's my opinion I would recommend.  Can't wait for the next book .
It was nice her reasons were just stupid for leaving,but it turned out nice in the end. Can't wait to read about wedding .
Beautiful passionate strong wonderful. All the emotion this is a great read finished it in 71/2 hours could not put it down wonderful. There is nothing like true love on a level on one can understand and feel but u and that person sweet .
This was an amazing part 2 can't wait for part 3. This book blowed me out the water everything just happened so fast for a moment I really throught it was over, it was so emotional happy sad angry I screaming at one point laughting  wow is all I can so I love it best ever .
As questioning as anyone, wanting a scientific explanation and the ability to educate others, this has been the best reference book I've read. If you need to do more research after reading this, Mr McDowell has provided more than enough references to continue your quest within the pages of this book, hopefully, you won't need any .
love it, however I would like it to have more auto controls on the keypad instead of having to go on screen. for the price, couldn't be beat. also, does not come with paid anti virus, you will have to purchase a Mcafee license after 14 days for $40 .
not a great case, not real happy with the material, personal preference I guess. It is a rough surface, I'm used to smoother surfaced cases. Product arrived later than expected but it great condition .
So about this product, i am unsure why so many people griped about it.It works well, whitens your teeth, and gives u good breathe.*It does burn a bit more than usual mouthwash, but nothing you shouldn't be able to handle.HOWEVER, AFTER ABOUT 2 WEEKS OF USING, I HAVE NOTICED BLACK HAIRY TONGUE developing on the back of my tongue.I will never use this stuff again, and now am getting a tongue cleaner to hopefully prevent the black hair to spreading up to anywhere where people may see it.I have very good dental hygiene, and am %100 certain it was caused from this product.(any mouthwash can disrupt the balance of yeast tho in your mouth and cause it .
First off I want to say I happy I was to see true halo fans expressing themselves in the reviews.---SPOILER ALERT---campaign/game:*Less than 5 hours of play.*They kill off cortana, and make her and MC seems as if they want to physically be together... (shes a computer tho).*THEY ruined the music. the theme song on the game just isn't right, it calls out "lets all cry", instead of halo 2 and halo 3's awesome theme song that makes u feel like the "beast" chief is suppose to be.*THEY ruined the covenant. the grunts voice is quite, and sounds wasp like. and worst off all, the elites dont even talk anymore, they just growl. what happened the "wunk wunk wunk! kill the demon.." halo 4 has none of this.*Added in a pointless new weapon set, that is exact same to current weapons, just look different, (the promethian weapons).Multiplayer:*THEY also took elites out of multiplayer.*Dont care for the "classes" on multiplayer.-but hey, even classes werent enough to resemble COD, they added killcams too.*IMO they should keep it like halo 3, and everyone starts with same gun and setup.*Hate how when a weapon spawns, it tells everyone on the map... preferred halo 3 when u had to know when it was going to spawn, etc.Game is ruined, they are trying to make it exactly like call of duty, which is killing them. THERE IS A REASON why everyone hated halo reach. althoug this game isnt as bad as reach was, it is still no true halo.Halo will never be the same, especially when they keep trying to make it more and more like COD.AT 343, STOP. WE like halo because its different then COD, so stop trying to make them the same, your just killing the game, if we want a cod like feel, we will play cod. NOT HALO, so stop making halo like cod, your ruining it.Overall, game is better than reach was, but doesnt even compare to halo 3. (halo has been going downhill ever since after H3 .
So I am unsure why people are giving this product such bad reviews.QUIT SAYING IT DIDNT MAKE YOU HAVE A LUCID DREAM...*To lucid dream, you need to self induce it. you cant take a pill and expect your dreams to become lucid.--partially is sellers fault, and should mention that.These pills will not make you have a lucid dream.HOWEVER, THEY WILL make you have extremely longer, clearer, and more vivid dreams.--Making your chances higher, and easier for you to have a lucid dream.so they work great with giving me more vivid and longer dreams, which also make them easier to remember in the morning.*also must add in, the smell of these things are rancid ahha. But a quick open the bottle, grab a pill, and swallow without breathing helps .
I am unsure if they sent me the wrong version, or if they have the wrong picture/description.But the item I received was for the OLDER white xbox 360, and does not work for the newer xbox slim.So now I can't use my xbox for an extra week while I deal with the return process .
I gave it 4 stars because I didn't realize they were hair and not actual feathers, so they won't work for my intended purpose. Overall the product is great, came on time and neatly packaged. The hair is soft to the touch and the clips are easy to use .
This is an amazing read! I couldn't put it down. One of those books when I finish I automatically buy the next :- .
Great book, don't wanna post too much and give any spoilers away, but if you like a hot romance this is a must read series .
All I can say is wow! I didn't get into this series until about 3/4 into the first book! It was a suspense of who did it plus erotica. I kept guessing and I ended up being right the first guess! I recommend it, the author is a genius .
Holy crap! Left me hanging...I want more! Getting started on book number 2 now! Wasn't sure at first but I thought it was great .
Keeps you on the edge! I didn't put it down all the way through!  No bathroom breaks were allowed! The end :- .
This book is just about perfect for the beginning forager!  Photos are clear, concise descriptions for each plant and the habitat where they grow.  And the descriptions of how to harvest, prepare and use these plants is great!  Kinda wish he would come down to the area I live and search out all the wonderful things here as well!  But he does mention many books in passing for those like me who are not upper Midwest inhabitants.  Looking forward to reading his other books .
I bought this because I thought it might help entertain our 6 month old on a few summer road trips.  She does not quite seem interested yet but the songs are cute.  I hoping we get better use out of it as she gets older .
Well plotted, great entertaining reading. Got me hooked since page one and kept me grappled epilogue last word. Best book I read in the last two year. If you liked Gone Girl, you certainly need to read it.At the end, you cannot help thinking that nothing happens for nothing, and Destiny is an entitled consequences of lots of tiny decisions and behaviors you think unconnected, or not .
An interesting tool to following trends and  latest developments in your field of interest. Easy to use if not familiar with social network .
I cannot figure out how to set it up with my Kindle. It takes too much input for getting any interesting suggestions. You need to schedule some time to make it work .
Great app. A must if u are on a busy business travel schedule. Would make packing easy and not time consuming.. well done .
Good relation price-functionality. Easy to use and automatically sync with Google, if you take some time to work the settings. You can create alerts &amp; deadlines, however I miss the assign to option.It would be a top app should it synced with outlook. Not there yet .
As someone else pointed out in his review, sound selection is great however it is a potty it does not play as background. Whenever it does, it would 've a hit .
the size is good! the details perfect, very comfortable! much relaxing view! in my case I came with the cleaning cloth! but the case is not the same .
I loved it, couldn't stop once I got started. I spent some time myself at sea and in the South Pacific and it made me wish I was young again. I lived every moment of this book in my imagination and I hope you will also. Bo Diehl .
I read this book in my teens and through the years I never forgot it's name. I thoroughly enjoyed it then as now. Now that I'm retired I look forward to reading more of Susan Howatch's books .
I found this book an interesting read for our times. We all live in uncertain times and I could see something like what happens in the book coming to pass, pray it never does .
This dictionary has been so helpful to me for preparing topics for my church's mens fellowship meetings. It groups important topics together and is easy to move around in. I don't think you could find a better reference dictionary for the money. I use it often .
This was a good sticker. It looks just as good in person as it does in pictures, and I've received many compliments on it. My only complaint would be that it didn't fit my 15-inch laptop very well and I had to trim down both the back and the wristpads to size .
Pros: it's light weightCons: Not stable or sturdy. Its too light that I will never suggest it for the heavy weight camera, especially those with big lenses. It will surely end up to the ground broken. Because this tripod is light it is only ideal for a small or a light weight camera .
Very value for money. I would definitely get another one. so far I did not find any cons with the product. It fits perfectly to my iPad air .
After purchasing the book for over $110 Pearson gave me typical pass-the-buck attitude when I was unable to access my course. Although it came with the access code more than 70% of my class could not access the class. They only encouraged us to purchase a separate code in order to access an only slightly different site, which makes you wonder why you have to hand over more than 150 just to gain access to the site you were promised access to in the beginning. And in addition to all of this, the actual site is hardly "intuitive" or any of the words they advertise it with. Mcgrawhill did a better job providing Connect Plus. Give them your money not Pearson, because all they care about is money not education, and that's coming from a finance major .
This book helps little kids understand that no matter what their daddy always love them. My daughters love the book and have requested the book every night for the past month .
This book had me on my seat and I couldn't put it down! It was attention grabbing, heart-stopping and tearfilled in many places and it is definitely a must read .
Well my battery arrived on time and I have no complaints except it didn't really fix the issue that I thought it would but it was a good purchase and I hope to make other puchases from Amazon in the future .
It provided adequate information but i could not stick to reading the book it seemed very thorough despite me lack of further interest in the book .
I enjoyed this book and was thrilled from beginning to end and it made me gasp in parts, cry, and show some concern for the Main Character Eden. This is truly a good book that I almost wish it didn't end. But All Great things must come to an end .
I just couldn't read the majority of the book yes it was somewhat helpful but I for some reason just didn't like the book .
I love this book I couldn't put the book down and it is intense, thrilling, attention grabber. I truly love this book .
Functions as described,performing all tasks as needed and for a very reasonable price. I'm sure I can adapt this for further needs not yet considered .
I'm sure it was a very good blender,  but was looking for a cordless model and didn't find in the description that it does have a cord. Never turned this on or tried this model .
Functions as described and in this brief time it seems like good sturdy long lasting quality. Only concern is that when carrying, there is no moisture barrier between the body and  the carry .
First of all the case was very good. The only problem I have a problem with is the holster. after only have this product the clip broke off. Now I have a case holster combo and can't even use the holster if I just wanted a case that's what I would have ordered! Would have rated 5 stars if clip had not broke off .
I've been using these goggles for the past 3weeks now. Overall they are quite good. The only issue I have is it gets fogged easily. I've to wipe it every 10mins. The suction around the eyes is good enough but not so much to cause goggle eyes. I wear it for an hour or so.Would recommend it to casual swimmers and beginners .
I had an ulnar nerve inflammation for many months. Even though I tried medicines, it kept recurring as soon as I got off the medicines. It was mostly due to my sleeping habit. I sleep on my side and that irritates the nerve causing constant pain. After using the IMAK elbow sleeve for 2-3 weeks now and my pain has considerably subsided.The sleeve fits snuggly on the elbow. Not too tight to cause itching or sweating. It is quite soft and feels comfortable while wearing it through the night.Am very satisfied with the purchase and would highly recommend anyone having the same issue.Cheers,Satish .
I've used this case for 2 weeks now. It is quite light and doesn't add a lot of bulk to my N7. In fact it helps with the grip especially when you are walking around with the N7 in your hand.Pro:+ Light weight+ Looks like genuine leather+ Fits snugly without adding any extra dimensionsCon:- The (free) screen protector is not oleo-phobic and screws up your touch experience. I had to order another one shortly after .
I wanted to gift a watch for my girlfriend's 30th b'day. I looked for many many weeks and finally when I saw the Stuhrling Countess Elite - I knew right away this is it.Everything about the whole product is perfect for gifting. The watch comes in an elegant box the size of a wine bottle. On the box there is a message in golden print about the Stuhrling brand. Inside it, is the magnificent watch along with the warranty, manual, etc.The watch looks very classy and expensive. The watch face is clear with the blue hands forming a great contrast to the background. The strap has a dull chrome finish. It is not flashy at all which makes it a perfectly sober watch to wear to work everyday or to an evening out.It had the exact effect I wanted my GF to have. She was absolutely overjoyed about it. :)Definitely recommend to anyone who wants to gift it !..Cheers,Satish .
All straps fell off when attached to my harness and the bag fell off whilst i was climbing. This does not meet my satisfaction at all .
This case is not a very good quality for the price u have to pay for it. I kept haven to put it together every time I used my phone. And the black rubber part has all turned white instead of staying black. Will not buy another case like this again .
i used it on wooden door frame.in tropical climate. high humidity, temperature approx 30 celcius.good points:= it works 2 layers at a time (apply moderately, enough to look slightly damp with gel).= does not irritate eyes and breathing= low odourbad points:= need to apply moderate layers, strip off, then re-apply, strip off. it did not work on more layers when i apply thickly.= dries easily. i had to strip within 1 hour of applying or else the gel dries and the paint on my wooden door frame doesn't come out .
its a good deal for the money. it works fine. no problem. only the carrying case is of low quality .
good quality..provides super protection ( better than much pricier branded cases) but its kind of big and bulky so not easy to slide in pocket..but definitely good deal for the money paid .
This game is not a normal game at all it tests your ability to tap and swipe and mostly order your cards and save your money for more great hero's and villains of D.C get the game. But I really hate that you have to wait for your character's energy and have to have a three on three . I love this game because I love D.C .
I really wish I had not wasted my money on this..  While both of the cams I bought did work..  The field of view is terrible..  Trying to get the settings right was hard enough.  And the motion detection really don't work..  It will record once , when you first turn it on then after that 90% of the time it won't turn back on. My opinion is this..  Spend the extra and get something that works the way it's supposed to.  By the way the clothes hook is like 5 inches long..  Don't even make sense for it to be so big .
they're ok. wouldn't recommend the amount that I paid for them. Did I make a mistake and buy a woman's sandal .
My 4 1/2 yr old loves taking pics with my phoneSo thought this would be a good ideaAnd it's great! Wasn't expecting it to do as much as it does with picturesmy son loves it! Making games and stories with silly pics and giving dad a silly mustacheLol! One drawback you need good lighting ..it should have a flash or something .
Bought this for my 4 1/2 yr old! It helped him count he loves it everyday at about nap time he's ready to see what's the next day lego ..it wasn't a big deal that some of the stuff was on the box not everything was shown ..only problem I had was some of the days were kinda lame but I'll definitely buy another next yr .
Everything works great price even greater although my husband says it sounds horrible on his end he can't here me very well .
Better than the first and excited to start the third!!! I can't wait to see how it all comes to an end .
The books were great but short. They were all hard to put down you just want to keep reading. I just wish there was one more book and it didn't end so quickly .
Its a book you just can't put down!!!!! I can't wait to read the next 2 books of the series .
It was a very good book with a lot of action but it was just not long enough for what I expected .
For the price! it's great! it came with everything and it has excellent quality! no regrets at all. Totally recommended .
it has an amazing zoom and a great resolution,  it's hard to get a great picture during movement. With a little of practice you can achieve a good picture but it's not easy. For the price, you get an excellent product. If i could turn back in time, i would buy it again .
It's excellent! easy to use! the battery in mode flight last forever!! no regrets at all! The expandable memory it's great .
not a bad app. kinda addictive but yet frustrating all in one. kind of hard figuring out the song while its played by a piano. definitely would recommend this for people who love music .
They're holding up after 5 months so that's good. Ill update If any problems occur, hopefully they do not though .
It's only somewhat large because I bought extra wide for my mom (not wanting to insult her with ones that were too small lol) She loves them, she just tucks leggings into them. they resemble campus boots I'm glad I got em .
Great stuff.....love it. Good for my skin and so easy to apply. No product on your hands and does not sweat and run off your face and into your eyes .
Entertaining parable about growing up and choosing to be open or closed to life. Outstanding performance by Alfred Molino as the count .
I got this hat for a gift for my boyfriend. He absolutly loves this hat and none of his friends or family has it because it is so unique .
Keeps my coffee hot all morning, doesn't leak, has a lock feature on the drinking button. Does everything it's supposed to do .
The item arrived on time, which is always a good. However, the packaging was taped together. That kind of disturbed me. These items are yes for fun and to show off, but still they are an eating utensil and the package was open, that just seemed gross. Nothing said they were used .
This was really an amazing book, It was unique and inspiring and I just couldn't get enough. I wish there was another boolike it .
I installed this on my girlfriends broken htc rezound and it not only looks like new, it also works like a charm .
I have two destructive chewers. And I've made a decision that I need another one of these, they argue over it now! I love that the disks are so inexpensive and that they haven't ripped it to shreds or choked on it yet. &#128077;&#128077 .
This was a page turner ... I couldn't  put the book down! Excellent read! It was a modern twist to Cinderella to  all those , like me , who just  love their Disney .
Right now the rocker does not work. The speakers only have static. We are going to look at it again this weekend and if we can't figure it out we will have to send it back. We do not have the original bax is that a problem .
I received my antenna went out to the garage and tried installing it. It did not fit my 2013 Explorer .
It has been three weeks and I cannot tell any difference.  I will continue until taking it but I am not hopeful .
I was so excited to get this case and when I recived it not two days later the gold started rubbing off in the back and it is very dull now. I even had a piece fall off .
i had a pair of supras almost a year ago and wanted to buy another pair...the quality is what you'd expect from a pair of supra shoes...they look good feel good just don't wear them in winter (why my first pair got ruined .
This damn app SUCKS. It was a waste of my freaking time!! Please don't download...it barely allows you to do anything .
I wanted this to take notes and get on line while the kids had the  computer, and I could not be happier .
bought this and it does not seem original, parts look very cheap, and he keyboard came defective. I contacted the seller and right away sent another keyboard. he only part that seems cheap is the battery cover. I don't think its worth the money .
THIS PHONE IS AWESOME !!!SUPER FAST,  I HAVE TRIED RUNNING 8 APPS AT ONCE TO TRY TO MAKE IT LAG AND NOTHING, AS IF NO APPS WERE OPEN, NO LAG AT ALL, TRUE MULTITASKING!!!!!!I TRY TO SHOW OFF MY PHONE TO EVERYONE I CAN , AND YES THEY ARE AMAZED AND PUT A SMILE ON THEIR FACE. THE UI IS GREAT AND THERE IS SO MUCH TO LOVE ABOUT THE PHONE. CAMERA IS NORMAL, TIMESHIFT IS AWESOME, HUB IS NICE. AND THE BATTERY IS PRETTY GOOD, AND I AM A HEAVY USER.PEOPLE GIVE BLACKBERRY A CHANCE, TRY IT OUT AND SEE FOR YOURSELF, DON'T LISTEN TO ALL THOSE AWFUL """" REVIEWS"""" FROM AUTHORS THAT HAVENT EVEN USED THE PHONE AND TO MY GUESS I THINK ARE GETTING PAID TO BASH THE PHONE. I RECOMMEND IT 100% U WONT REGRET .
I bought it because of the reviews, and said, well they must be good. FIRST OF ALL shipping was SUPER FAST. SECOND these speakers blew my expectations, i can not believe they sounds SO LOUD AND SO CLEAR in that size, they are super small and sound super nice, i really really liked them, and they look good .
I recently downloaded fashion story; my city; and pet shop and my kindle acted up and I had to rest it and now I can't get back on any of my things and I'm very upset my id is retunyra318 and it want let me do anything someone please help me because its the same device ive been using so I don't know what to do hellllllp!!!!!!!!!!!! someone .
It is truly one of the most interesting and fascinating books I 've ever read!!! Yet, if you have very good vision don't buy the cheap one, It has terrible print job and your eyes will hurt trying to read it.A book you should definitely own.Cheers .
Most people complain that it's not bright, but a lava lamp is more for decoration rather than brightness. I wanted one since I was a kid, and now that I got it I'm living a childhood's dream. Excellent price for a brand new product .
I am not part of the crew that watches it at night, but they both sound very interested with the series .
The quality is not what I hoped for. It makes you think that the adjustment will come handy, but it's really a pain .
This shirt was exactly as ordered. I have other shirts of this brand, so knew pretty much what I was ordering. The order was delivered on time, no issues. I would order from this company again .
There was nothing wrong with the shirts themselves, just to small. I have already tried the larger size and it didn't fit either. Brands differ, this one just doesn't happen to fit me .
This power adapter works great. I bought it at the same time I bought my Kindle and according to some of the reviews, it was nothing special and you can get them anywhere.....but it was half price on amazon, no tax, no shipping, why would you waste your time looking for one someplace else .
This is my first kindle and therefore my first cover. I read the reviews before I ordered the Moto cover, so I was aware of the problem with the magnets and the kindle not shutting down correctly, but it sounded like the problem had been fixed. Now I think it is just a matter of getting one that the magnets are in the right place. The cover is not putting the kindle to sleep when I close the cover, so it takes longer for it to shut down on its own, so the battery doesn't last as long. As far as fit and feel I don't have anything to judge it by, but I do like it and I do need a cover, but I'm not sure about the Moto at this time. I will probably return it and try something else .
This is a nice sturdy cover for the paperwhite. The paperwhite fits very snug, you don't have to worry about it falling out and should you drop it, it is very well protected, and it looks good. The only down side, and this is just me, I like to be able to fold the cover back, that way I can lay it down and read hands free .
When I purchased this book, I didn't realize that it was a &#34;summary&#34; so was surprised when it arrived in the mail.  I wasn't that keen on reading the book in the first place, but since our book club choose it for April's read, I was going to read it.  Things turn out for the best, usually, as all I had to do with this is devote 50 minutes and I got a brief idea of what the book was about so feel I can participate, but mainly listen, when we have our review .
The only reason I gave it one star is, I can't use it.  It was my fault when ordering as I thought I was ordering the longer one, 54&#34;, but it was for a shorter board.  I have to always order on-line my covers since I seem to have a larger board but this time, I just didn't pay close enough attention to how I checked the box .
I am very pleased with the half slip I purchased.  It isn't easy finding the length that I wanted in the stores so went on-line and found it right away on Amazon.  The quality and length is perfect .
I'm sure this is a great product but just isn't working well with my new induction range.  I do use it at times, but can't be used with too high of a heat as it sets bells and whistles off on the range top!  I think it's quite an expensive item, and for me, it really was a waste of my money.  I'm sure, others will be happy with it if they don't have a problem with their range top using it .
Love this flavor and have not found it in any of the stores I shop at in years.  I was so disappointed, thinking they no longer make this flavor but was pleasantly surprised when I found it on-line.  It's the second time I've ordered it.  I have one recipe that calls for it in a Jell-O salad and is one of the family's favorite.  Was so glad to find it again a few years ago .
Nice game, bit too long in downtime, food for 1-2 players, no wonder in top 10 of BGG list, strongly recommend to boardgame lover. Waiting to play the expansion as well .
I was very impress with how bright and durable the headlight was, the front mount was very easily installed to my oversized road bike, but I gave it a 3 star due to the rubber strap loosening every time I went over a bump. I was very concerned that the headlight would eventually fall off overtime. Great news of all, after receiving the product a few days I received a email from one of the chief marketing officer of the company saying they receive several concerns about the rubber strap and in the final stages of re-engineering a studier one. Also, said they will be shipping the new front mount to all their customers at no cost. I was very pleased to hear this, this has been the best customer service I've experienced shopping on Amazon! I was initially skeptical to see if they would hold up to their word.  As I waited, turns out that they did indeed re-design a very solid bracket that does hold the light in place very well!  The interesting part, which I rarely see from companies any more, a sincere hand written letter from the company president. Given that he told me to be honest in his letter, I am doing to have to give this a three star review.  It would have been a one star review if would have not been for the company sending me the new bracket.  I really like Magnus Innovation and would be a repeat buyer.  I would give a 5 star review the next purchase or new product. I would highly recommend shopping with this company as they offer excellent customer service and sincerely listen to their customer's problems .
Simple but brilliant movie in this niche. 2 thumbs up!  A look into the life an conflicts of an intersection/TG teen.  Highly recommend this film for those with an open mind and those that into the beauty of things and not the perversions .
I went into this not expecting what I got. Great Charters, nerve felt rushed.My only complaint is that there were moments I felt there were so many people with powers I couldn't remember who did what. I could have used reference page lol .
awesome read, great author, overall great book. I can't wait for the next one to come out and learn more about the characters .
The spoons did adeptly identify the four measurements.  However, there is no marking to indicate what the measurments are in fractions of one teaspoon .
This was a kit and I didn't  want that, but the company was very understanding and took it back and paid the postage .
Was a x-mas gift for my daughter in law, she informed me that it made her roast taste wonderful.  See she's not a cook .
Loved it!!! I would have left a similar review for the first book but I couldn't wait to start this one. Looking forward to the 3rd book .
Where are the "Jack"s in the world?  This man was delicious, and needs to come home with me!  Not only that, but I was completely engrossed in the story - once I picked it up, I couldn't put it back down!  The chemistry between Jack and Sara starts out as friendly, then changes to turbulent, and then ends up being passionate.  It was a huge roller coaster ride!  The story was a complete erotic novel with an alpha male, a tempting heroine, and hot, hot sex scenes.  Speaking of sex scenes, even though it was not an actual BDSM theme, there were some serious dominant tendencies.  Loved it - it was a great read .
This was an absolute 5 star book for me!  It has it all: romance, suspense, a serious plot twist, and scorching hot love scenes.  The story is about Jade, who has endured some serious setbacks in life, and her alpha male hottie Jeremy.  The two of them become a couple while Jade is reeling from a serious personal trauma, as well as having to overcome all the normal hurdles in a new relationship.  So well put together, I could feel myself in the book, walking around with the characters!  Just when you think you have the story all figured out, Ms. Michaels pulls the rug out from under you!  It was so well written, the characters were perfectly developed and it had some perfectly choreographed sex scenes that were not too much, but added the perfect amount of kink to the story.  I was enthralled from page one!  This book needs to be on your TBR pile .
"Domination in Pink" was an amazing story!  The chemistry between the two main characters Lydia and Damian was smoking hot!  Both of them have dominant personalities and their interaction is intense.  The story includes BDSM, light spanking, and bondage which created some intense sex scenes.  The story line was easy to follow, even though it was a part of a series.  This short story could be a stand alone, but I had to go buy the rest of the Club El Diablo Books so I could read more about the characters.  I was hooked from the minute I started reading and could not put it down!  I give it 5 stars .
I have not yet finished Season 5. Inasmuch as the file is incomplete. Customer service is working on the problem. It seems that episode 14 is missing .
Disappointed. Didn't learn anything I wanted to know. How hard would it be for someone to simply show illustrations of all the icons with descriptions of their functions .
Wonderful little flier! I would highly recommend it! I wouldn't recommend it for small children. But great for age 12 on up .
Did not work for 3 weeks not soooooooo happy won't buy tis again sorry for buying it the first time try harder .
Order a month ago still have not receive it yet what's going on it please send too me soon thanks .
Compelling reading. That is why I have ordered more of her books in this series. Can't review them yat as I have not read them .
Please see my review of the third in the series.  I thought I was talking about this book.  However, I have read Books 1, 2, 3 and now 4, and I cannot recommend them highly enough.  Wonderful series .
Can't wait to put on my daughter's crib. It is super soft and looks way better in person. It matches the Happi Tree line perfectly .
Super soft and so cute! the happi tree line is an adorable idea for a girls room and you can't beat the price .
THIS IS THE WORST POPCORN MAKER I EVER OWNED.I USED IT A FEW TIMES AND IT BROKE.BEWARE;;;;BEWARE;;;;;;DON'T BUY IT .
PLEASE DONT BUY! I brought this for my daughter knowing that it was like a tablet I brought this because she likes to watch Netflix and go on YouTube it does not work both apps that I tried to download does not work horrible product do not buy waiting for seller to contact me so I can return it for a full refund .
This battery did not work at all, that is my fault for buying a battery for 5 bucks. I don't recommend .
I love the color of these Shades but they are REALLY oversized I am not short I am 5'9 and 180 so you can image how big they are on my face. Just a heads up .
The &#34;leather&#34; will never be soft and supple... the zippers needed a little beeswax to work properly..., and there's no screen cover included..., BUT...it's a well engineered system with a perfect fit, and is certainly multi- functional.  I love it and would recomend it .
Interesting  going back in time and seeing how things have changed. kept my interest throughout and who doesn't love Hollywood no matter what era .
Although I am no Dummy - I play several instruments - I needed this book to improve my skills as I haven't picked up a bass in years.  Of course, all the &#34;Dummies&#34; books are written so commically, they are fun to read and learn from.  I would recommend it to any other &#34;Dummy&#34; out there.  It really was chock full of wonderful information .
Well, as long as my purple saxaphone doesn't ever fall over, it works just fine.  I also appreciated the price of it .
Same comment for my sax stand.  As long as my sax doesn't ever fall over it works just great.  For something so simple, it did take a minute to figure it out so it would balance right. But again, the price was right .
This series is not as good as LA Candy but this is a good addition to the fame game novels .
it actually does stay on through the night i have never found one that actually did until now. awesome cap .
I thought this would be alot like the ones that they give in the hospital but these are really hard and my baby doesn't like the feel of them in her mouth .
I love this Stroller organizer it keeps everything just where I need it. I don't really use the cup holders for anything but bottles and water bottles because I have holders on my Stroller but I love it .
my daughter is only 4 months so she doesn't play with it much yet. But it does put her right to sleep at night especially the last song I am not sure what it is but she goes right to sleep with that song on .
Doesn't stay cool that long it's good for organizing but not for more than an hour or two. I used it at a theme park and it was okay for the pouches not the bottles .
Wonderful, tear jerking an amazing insight into the life of  the wonderful Catherine Cookson.  Could not tear myself away fromthis compelling and sad story. Wonderful descriptive writing .
I rate the product low because the product shipped to me is faulty. The front cover screwed to the main body is broken/cracked, and I don't know how to go about it to restore it either by you guy or myself. If it were bought in the store such problem may not have arisen and even if it arises, taken it back will not have been a problem.Base on this fact it will be very difficult for me to recommend it for anybody from Amazon unless something concrete is done to restore it back to normal.Thanks .
I love this book! I don't know why people hate it so much! WTF is wrong with you?! Twilight is awesome!!! You have to read it .
THIS App is really a waste of time! It sucks! Whatever you do, don't get this! I got it and I really hated it .
Its a pretty good app for drawing manga and other cool things. I rarely use it, but when I do, it never fails to amaze me. I really love this app .
Item came quickly. Wasn't sure this was what I needed by just ordering off the internet, but was exactly the item I needed.  Am very pleased.  Thanks so much for a pleasant experience .
This product was easy to install and came with a template to help. I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for an exterior door for their pet. I also like the locking feature to where you can allow them out but not in and vise versa .
This product is just ok.  It looks better on the screen that on my bed at home.  I understood when I purchased this, that it did not have any stuffing, but I thought it would be alittle thicker that it is. The microfiber feel is nice, but the quality just doesn't seem to be there .
My son absolutely loves this toy but it is considerably harder to swith it between the vehicle and the dino than the smaller toys from this line .
Bought these books for my 9 yr old 3rd grade son. These books an rise an eyebrow here and there with the wording but honestly &#34;dumb&#34; and stuff like that, my children do not speak that way but I'm sure they hear it. The books themselves are actually really good! Love love  love .
I ordered 2 Dragon touch tablets for Christmas back at the end of October, since they were Christmas presents they didn't get opened till December 25th, one of the tablets does not charge or turn on...I've been trying to get in touch with someone to exchange this item for a new one.....So far NO luck.....Any suggestion would be appreciated .
I've been tanning for a good long time now, in tanning beds and outside. I love using this, I have pretty fair tan skin naturally and this product is amazing for me. I do also use a tingle lotion so that adds a boost. But if your a new beginner in tanning don't not use a tingle lotion it will burn the hell out of you. But I love this product along with the sparkle lotion by jwoww for after tanning .
i love it. its like you wete ont he ship and trying to escape its not that easy.i just love it so much .
I wish I could play it but the guy talk. ut nothing shows up and then ads come up when the guy is talking .

I don't know what I was expecting from this story but what it gave me was wonderful. I love how beautifully they were all tied in together .
Great shoe, I have always been a fan of the Gel-Kayano shoe. These are flashy colors and a perfect fit! Recommended these shoes to several friends .
I got this for free, but I'm happy I did. Simple and addictive, if only more games would be able to draw me in like this. I'm wondering what it is I love about it. But I can't think of anything. I'm just hooked .
I think I got what I wanted, it didn't dissapoint.For this money don't expect the faux fur to be shiny.I put them on and my socks look I rubbed them over a dog, still I'm happy.;-)So I was worried about it arriving but it came in a decent state with USPS, I was worried because USPS messed up another order of mine a week ago, but oh well.. Back to this item, good looking,and worth the wait.I ordered a size up because reviews here mentioned it to be wise to do so,and luckily I did . good shopping everyone .
Lucky for me I installed them two days ago and it just started raining yesterday! I like to have my windows cracked- people have body odor, food an various objects leave trails, I do not see how anyone simply wants to trap all that in there all day everyday. These are perfect because they allow you to give them that little aeration without fear of sudden weather shifts or someone taking advantage of the crack, no to mention the installation was beyond simple and really feels sturdy, I give these an A .
I ordered another costume (that was not only more expensive but came with far less pieces) that ended up being terrible. The day I got it I shipped it right back and only have a few days til my Halloween party I had to decide what to get in its place very fast, I ended up choosing this costume and loved everything about it! The shirt is really comfortable, the belts, shot glasses and hat are all really well made, and surprisingly for once in my life something I bought online ended up being better in person than in the picture. If you're liking the idea of this costume I say get it, you won't regret it at that price .
I ordered this unbelievably excited being a huge Star Trek fan and excited to wear it for Halloween....what I got in the mail looked nothing like the picture, not even close. Forget what other reviews said about not getting the &#34;delux&#34; with the pin and stars, I got that one and it was every bit as terrible as the cheaper one. The material is cheap and thin, it's loose in the wrong areas and tight on the others, I was truly ashamed of how terrible this costume was and the day I got it I immediately printed out the shipping label and returned it, save yourself the hassle and keep looking elsewhere. Why they didn't just go with a cotton material and make it an actualy shirt instead of having a zipper on the back I'll never know, I just hope someday I can find one that properly mimics the design from the series, all I can tell you is that this is definitely not it .
My old router was miserably slow and needed to be reset at least once a day ( I would call only once a good day) so I decided to upgrade and after a good amount of research I came to the conclusion that this was the best router in the price range. Initially when I recieved it the router didn't function, so I contacted the seller and they told me to ship it back, they then refunded me the amount for the shipping cost (including the roll of tape I had to buy to seal the package) and sent me a new one within a few days. I would definitely recommend buying this if you're in the market for a new router but don't want to spend too much. It's like a Weber grill, it's cheap but it's design and functionality are perfect .
I love how slim it is, and it feels so sturdy. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I have yet to have an experience (and hope to never have to) that really tests it out. But I have dropped it from short distances and the shock absorber edges help the phone bounce and then fall to the ground a little more lightly. I got this mixed with the Sir Lancelot Holy Grail screen protector and I can safely say my iphone feels like a tank .
I love everything about the costume, but the skirt was too short. Besides the fact it fit well and wasn't too tight or big. The materials used were very nice, especially the red hood which felt like a velvet texture. Much better then most store bought costumes .
I got exactly how it was described. It's about time someone thought of a Baby Boomer. Just cause we are old doesn't mean we can't learn new things and have fun in the process .
This book made me, my husband and our baby happy.No more stressful going to bed times for our 10 month old son. Just read it. I love all the tips, gentle and understanding tone of the author. She is a Mom and she is not talking like other people who do not know but suggest as if they know, her advices are based on science, experience and love.It changed so much! Thank you, Elizabeth! I can cook a dinner while my baby is sound asleep at 7:30 with a gentle method: dinner at 6, bath and 6:30, 7-reading in a quet dimmed room and voila-he fell asleep within 15 minutes. No more crying, baby swings, sleep remedies, screaming in the crib. Just pure comforting bed time routine at right time. We did not know about it and took our baby to bed at 8 when he was overtired so he passed the gate of sleepiness. No more...7 pm-magic time .
My son and I love this colorful big book. It looks like an encyclopedia for babies with many animals, birds and fish. The pictures are so bright and so many that it doesn't get boring to look at them and read the names all over again. It takes some minutes for my 6 month old son to look at each page! Love it! Thank you the publisher and seller .

This book is written by a priest. It is religious and material. Stairs to climb to heaven, seeing Jesus and all the characters of the Bible? Heaven is not material, heaven is energy, God is energy, it is NOT a person. I stopped reading and wrote to the author and asked him about the material sides of the book. He never replied me. I said it all. The book does not cover real things, it is all made up by a religious priest .
My 7 month old is enjoying these songs. It makes parent's and child's mood bright and does not annoy like other kids songs! Moreover these songs are positive and filled with sense. They have meaning. For instance a song about Mommy who always comes back, another one about a child feeling good when he took his diaper off and uses the potty, about reading a book, about walking. I listened to many classic songs about funny silly stuff but this album actually teaches children and parents to take it easy when it comes to everyday life. It is beautiful, soothing and fun! I actually compared PiKaboo album and it has more songs including the songs from the album. So you better buy it.I regret i did not see it and bought this for the same price but less songs. It is also by Palmer on Amazon http://www.amazon.com/Peek-A-Boo-Songs-Children-Hap-Palmer/dp/B00000I6YJ/ref=pd_luc_sim_02_04_t_lh?ie=UTF8&psc=1 .
we bought this blanket to work out in fresh air, playdates in the park, picnics. it feels nice, cushioned and flat-doesb not wrinkle and fly from the wind. our baby is crawling on it, playing and relaxing too :) he spit up on it and it is waterproof, just wiped it with a wet wipe-looks fresh an clean! good purchase .
This teether works great when the baby can hold it himself. 7 month and up. Our son used it before as he started to teeth earlier, we would hold it for him. But now as he is able to do it himself he uses this brush every day, it is perfect for theose sore gums. We attached it to the pacifier string with clip and our baby uses it all day! Unlike other brushes it is safe from both ends, it doesn' fall apart in baby's mouth and it is soft, so that if he falls down, he won't injure himself if the brufh is in his mouth. Moreover the lashes of the brush are just right and perfect for teething. Thank you, Amazon .
Thick plastic, nicely made reversable paded cover, easily washable, the only thing which is hard to do is to retract the chair. but we use it in one position, so it's not a big deal. easily and secure attaches to the chair,steady and the child has a seat belt too. good product for the price. I would pay even more for it .
hay and organix-these are the foods we give to our bunny. he is healthy and happy. other foods contain chemicals, nuts and grains are bad for rabbits. one of my bunny died because of bad diet, i fed him with a rabbit food from pet co. so no nuts, no sugar, just hay, organix, lettuce .
I read all reviews and after I saw it today I have the following updates on this item to tell you about:-The wheels have a thin layer of white rubber now. (they don't have it on the photo here)-The wheels spin very well, just put them according to the instriction: screw with a little ring to space the wheel from the baseI would not give to a child the stick of the xylophone unsupervisedMy son is 9 month old and needs our support now but I am sure it will be a great walker as he grows and learns to balance himselfThis product is better than others we saw and used. I recommend it to the gits who can stand on their own very stable and are ready to learn how to walk .
These are comfy and cute, ordered them one size bigger than my size as my size did not fit, I think the model has small sizing. anyways the returns are free and it is like having a personal shopper who delivers cute shoes to your door. try, keep or return if did not fit. These shoes are chic for going out. love them .
they stay nicely on my 6 month old. yes he is a tall guy although they are a little long we still wear them and they don't fall down like other pants, they are designed for baby legs not like other pants which are designed for adults and just looks small .
i recommend these hooks. cute, light do not make any noise. they are cheap and light weight. i like them .
We are using this gel on our 8 month old son. He has fine blond straight baby hair and lots in the middle. The gel makes him look so cute with his hair groomed to the side. It looks very natural and not greasy. He looks neat and modern. a plus of this gel is that it is safe-organic. thank you .
Good product but the music is loud, there is no volume control. we are keeping it since it is multifunctional .
First we swaddled out baby in the swaddle pod from Summer Infant.As the baby grew up and became 2-3 months we needed smth bigger, I expanded the swaddle pod with the help of a sewing machine and little pieces from my husband's tshirts he did not want to wear anymmore- it looks cute and handmade now-it worked well and we used them until our son was 5 months. Now they still fit him but I wanted smth fresh and bought the Woombie. They are the same as Swaddle pods but thicker and bigger to fit a bigger baby. two sided zipper is perfect. i like the wombie for winter sleeping time but in summer i preferred my hand expanded swaddle pods as they are thinner .
when wet the baby skin is covered by the gel material. i don't know how it happens but the stuffing covers baby skin. bad .
i threw away and returned many creams before I found the right one. this lotion is light but nourishing. leaves my hands soft but not sticky. the fragrance is very light almost smell free. i would recommend it to a queen! beautiful! thank you .
the quality is fine but it is black not silver grey as it is shown. returning as it is too dark for my bathroom .
This rug is very beautiful and it looks much more expensive. In the store we would pay $500 for it. We bought 9X12 size and it covered all our big living area. The colors are warm, not busy, good taste! I am impressed and love our room more now! Very, very beautiful .
We used to buy waxelene in plastic tubes but we needed more for our baby's diapers after circamsision. Our doctor recommended to use vseline on them so that the operated part of our son's bottom would not stick to the diaper as it was healing. It is a wonderful alternative to vaseline. We love this stuff and are happy how smooth, thick and healing it is .
My son started to play in it since he was 4 month old. Now he is 6 and jumps and plays, looks up at the Giraffe and lion and the monkey, tries to reach them and reaches them, spins, sits, stands, chews and sucks on the special teething leaf, horse head and a parrot head. 2 activity inserts an elephant that turns and makes sounds and little mouse underneath. The other activity book with cats on a bar, he moves them and when he flips pages there is light and music. He can play in it for so long and it is very safe. Love it and wouldn't buy anything like just a jumper in the door. I liked that it was more stable and secure when I was looking on amazon for a jumper. I was afraid that it was too big but it looks fine in the room .this jumper is super engaging, entertaining and it spins around. Love it! My son laughs and smiles and makes happy sounds in it .
I bought this kit as a present and i love how it looks. It is not tiny but a nice normal box which is beautifully decorated and shows what is inside. I think this is a good idea if you want to give some love to a mother to be .
We are returning it as we need a true walker. this one is jus a small unsturdy for beginning walkers cart. good for those who already walks but not right for those who don't .
These shoes are unusual as the raised part on the heel does not give any blisters on your foot. Usually all new shoes do. They are cushioned and made of leather. I wear them with leggings for walks with my son in the park or when i go to the store. Nice casual and very comfortable shoes. I bought 8,5 as 8 my usual size did not fit me .
My 6 month old liked it and played with it while we walked. He likes variety and he got tired of it. I wish this toy could transfrom from one look to another so it doesn't get boring. When my boy got bored with it i just took it off from the stroller. Other then that the quality is good, nice soft music (2 melodies), not annoying. Fits car seats and strollers .
This doesn't look as shiny and chic as on the picture. It looks like a cheap rag, grey and the thread is thin, so it looks like a net, so thin! I am returning this as i don't want my bedroom look cheap and dull .
my skin looks fresh and smooth with this foundation, minerals are great for oily/normal skin-no shine and lasts all day .
Works great in rain. Fits our car seat Chicco. I don't use it from sun, although it has a reflective light cover. I use it only in the rain since the net is not the best thing if you want your child to get fresh air. I cover his car seat by light blankets as Aden and Anais to protect from the sun .
these are soft, sturdy and shiny. comfy silky feel and they are not as thin as the ones they sell in cvs.pefect for wearing with leggins and jeans.love them .
I got this ring in the mail today in a beautiful box and velvet bag. It is a designer ring made of Vermeil-the mix of precious metals as gold and silver. It is very neat and just right for feminine hands, not to bulky or busy, delicate and makes statement. The gems are sparkly, the pearls are gently wired in the middle. Thank you! I will wear it when we go out with my husband .
These pills work great for my 5 months old. They help to calm his pain and soothes him. We are also using the organic mint teething gel by Earth's best. As this gel was rated as the best one and doesn't contain chemicals like Hyland's gel. That's why we did not buy the gel by Hyland's-we only found the tablets by Hyland's natural. These tablets are natural and help with moderate pain. If the pain is too strong and no gel no tablets do not help we give our little one some Tylenol (half a dose) but very rare as we do not want him to eat sugar and chemicals of tylenol. Also as a natural remedie combination-Gripe water works great with teething meds .
perfect cleaning wipes for sensitive baby skin. before we were using other wipes, they were thinner, they were called seventh generation. These ones are thicker, have cure bears on them and do not smell. They also clean very well. Baby poop, urine, baby oil. we even use them for our personal cleaning needs. But I suggest to wash a baby's bottom after he poops since no wipe can wash as fresh water .
I use this Projector and the Sound machine when I take my bbay to sleep. The relaxing tune of Rock a bye baby is the tune of our bed time routine. He also likes to fall alseep looking at the images of the projector on the ceiling or on the wall. I also use the projector as the night light for night feedings. The light is deemed and my husband doesn't wake up, like before when i used regular lamp light. The upper button is always bright on this machine so we taped it with a black tape so that it doesn't shine at night.So i use the projector light insted as the night light. I also like the ocean sound, mozart, lullabies, rain. I bought the same machine for my cousin's son and sent it to her to Russia. This machine is really helpful .
Here is why, 5 positions, padded seat for a child, a baby sits on his bottom on Cybex while on other carriers he sits on his crotch. That's why I returned them and kept Cybex. The head support for facing a mother position and if you want to place a baby to face out then just fold that pad down. Easy to put the baby in. The carrier expands as the baby grows by unzipping the zipper in the middle.  This Carrier is made for a baby's and a parent's comfort. The padded straps and support on the lower back and shoulders spread the weight so well you even don't feel it! Finally I can carry my son in a properly made carrier. I used others and mu child screamed in them. Then I made a research and top nine carriers included Cybex. There was  Trekker in the article too, but it is shipped from Canada so I hesitated to order Trekker because of their return policy. Try Cybex carrier and you will keep it as I did .
My normal but medium scared by acne and with freckles skin looks so healthy after first use! I started with the !st Level Perfect Image Peel and I loved it. I use it more often than this one but it is a great in between exfoliator, lightener and rejuvinator. This Level 2 Peel is much stronger and I use it once every 2 weeks. It is a great alternative to Salon Treatment at home. Safe affordable and better results! I spent 200+ on microdermabrasions with peels but the results were not as great as with these peels. I love these. I wish I knew about them earlier. My skin is so smooth and it feels very gentle and the scar marks/scars are lighter and freckles are lighter too! I am saving money, time and do it myself which I love as I do not like anyone touching me. Thank you .
nice and stylish. like them. sparkly in the sun. the hills are a little slippery but the shoes are not slippery because the bottom is not .
our baby did not feel comfortable and cried in this carrier. the quality is very good but if the baby is not comfortable what is the purpose of keeping the carrier. we are returning it .
i like this set, my son looks cozy and comfy in these onesies and pants. White color and green color are great on him and pants fit baby legs perfectly, do not slide down and stay on him .
i would not wear them outside as the fabric is too thin and the shoes got holes in two weeks of wearing. i liked them though as they were comfy but now i know they are not sturdy .
did not like it as it was too short. like a shirt but not a dress. anyways. i donated it .
leaves my skin clean and smooth. it is creamy gel with micro beads which foams when you massage it. leaves my skin very clean and smooth. nice light smell.big tube and very little is required for each wash as the product is very rich and not liquid. i recommend it to other girls and women with normal skin. exfoliation keeps the skin young .
I can not believe how shoes can change the performance of my workout. before i had old leisure shoes for working out and running in Baby Boot Camp. I am a stay at home mom and shoe shopping is only possible for me online. As these shoes had free returns I ordered them. I keep them and will order another pair in future as they are so comfortable and accommodate my feet super well! I was running easier, faster, no pain in my shins and foot as before.urned out my leisure shoes were not right and these New Balance shoes are very right! They keep the motion soft ad jumpy. I love these shoes and my workouts are better in them. Thank You for such a good service and quality product! I am very happy and just love that I figured it all out now not later as wrong shoes were ruining my feet, legs, work outs and mood .
Although i like the bottle and the smell but this cream doesn't work. I put even alot of cream and massaged it into my hands. My hands got actually drier. I am still thinking may be it will work but it doesn't. waste of money .
I ordered beige color and it looks like skin color. My husband was not happy about me wearing a girdle but once he saw me in a pink Juicy Couture dress he agreed that it worth wearing. I just had a baby and I am size M. The girdle is true to size. It hides my tummy and makes me look more fit and skinny. Thank you .
good size and wide, super cute color for my white and blue bathroom. they are not luxury but nice thick towels for every day use .
the child should spread his legs very wide in order to sit in this carrier. it is not gymnastics so we are returning it .
True to size, looks nice, fits well, doesn't fall down. Interesting style, mini and midi in one which is also comfy for me, young Mom who plays with her baby:) People comlimented me. Recommend .
Beautiful and lots of it! I got it for me and my mom and I love the quantity I got-two rolls! They are also the size of a standard cabinet so you do not have to cut a lot .
Shiny, comfy, very warm, soft. I bought them for Tahoe. Buy a size bigger. I am M and L/XL fits me just right. Lined with warm thick and soft fleece. Look sexy and not bulky. Great for my Tahoe Winter retreat. I will wear them just for walk in the snow. Love them and would buy them again .
I have been using this product two days. On the first day I noticed significant change of my appetite. I did not want to snack and ate half of my dinner. Today again I felt full in the morning after my breakfast and usually I have tea after the breakfast before afternoon with snacks or a dessert. I ate a little of the snacks and felt full so quick that I did not want to finish. I am going to update this review in a month to inform if I lost any weight.For now I love these natural pills for suppressing my cravings and appetite. It is very wonderful change for me!Update: I stopped taking this supplement as it stopped working. Now I do not eat sugar and I lost 6 pounds! Just do it! Sugar is bad for you! It goes straight to fat, makes you anxious! I look so skinny now! Very happy. I replaced sugar by tangerines, apples and dates in coconut. Yummy! I eat dessert once a month as a treat.Plus I eat Oatmeal with honey, water and a little nuts for breakfastLunch: anything I want but cut the portionDinner: anything I want but cut the portionSnacking: sweet apples, tangerines, coconut covered dates, avocados.I feel great! And I look great .
I ordered several pairs of shoes but nothing is like Momo Shoes repeat the foot shape, they are soft, comfortable and cute! I wish they came in light booties for rainy day. For now we ordered three different designs of Momo shoes for our 18 month old son .
i wear m and it fits me well! i am breastfeeding too, so this bra really keeps everything together, no more bouncing! slightly padded but sof, great material! i recommend this sports bra .
Comfy, fits well and does not pinch boy's gentle places. I wish the the collar was a little wider or had snaps as it is hard to put it on, I have to expand it with my hands and it is not easy. Other than that I recommend these cute shirts .
Order a size bigger for your son. Our son has a wide foot and these did not fit him. But the quality and look are great .
i like this creeper with little embroidered pictures of frogs, turtle and elephants. it is very easy to snap and it opens up all the way making it so much easier to wear than onesies. it is perfect for boys' diapers as it doesn't squish anything and does not dig into the skin as the onesie pants. fom now on i'm using creepers instead of onesies as shirts and summer clothing. the fabric is light cotton, fresh white color and i always buy 2 sizes bigger. it still fits comfy and my son grows into it .
it helps to ease he symptoms as if he  is not sick anymore.great.always using it when my baby is sick .
I like these shoes for the proper design for comfort and development. I returned 8 pairs of other brands and I checked two more brands in the store. Everything was not comfy for my son who has a wide foot. Get a size bigger. The round shape is the best for toddler's toes. I got them for him to run in the morning on wet grass or after the rain but they can also be work in Spring/ Fall as sneackers .
my son is sleeping in it right now, his one arm is out and we are getting t the point when we won't use swaddling anymore.woombies and swaddle pods are so great. who needs unflexible blankets if you can use them. this woombie breezes well-very comfy .
It did not help at all. I lost money not weight. Not even an ounce, I excersize and eat healthy but this fat burner did not help at all .
4 stars for the size-runs big. I ordered M and I usually wear M( 5'5, 149) the dress was too big for me so I gave it to my Mom who wears L, it fits her perfectly! It looks very beautiful on her. I am glad I do not have to return it .
So happy with this crib! It looks even better in real life. Solid thick wood, thick white finish, beautiful design and comfortable structure. There is a string net for the mattress holder instead of just a board which makes this crib-bed so comfortable and flexible. I could give this bed 10 stars. The shipping was not 2 days though but we got the crib during the week and it was worth waiting .
My best thing in the kitchen! I can cook on it without oil and it won't stick! Beautiful healthy surface. A masterpiece for cooking! Thank you and I am washing it by hand! It came with a felt thick pad to put inside when storing in the cabinet with other pans. German quality .
I do not usually read this genre, but when I read The Prisoner's Wife, I was pleasantly surprised at how quickly I was drawn in to Shawn Macguire's story. I loved the flawed characters of this novel as well as the shocking insight in to the lesser known workings of the CIA - it wasn't long before I was completely hooked, racing through the pages and then left wanting more.  In fact, I am now reading other books in this genre which is something I really didn't expect!  I look forward to seeing more from this author .
This was a replacement for one I had for 25 years.  It is very easy to use.  There wouldn't Thanksgiving noodles if I didn't have this machine .
I was pleasantly surprised at the detail included in the book.  I plan to use it to prepare for a disaster like the natural ones occuring in our country.  Have not checked any similar products .
Great stuff! I like this Better than regular hair gel.  It holds extremely firm and does not get all crispy like gel. Allows for some pretty awesome styling .
This knife lived up to the hype. I was really impressed by the solid build quality of a knife in this price range. I was a little concerned about the overall length of the blade being too long for edc, but I found that I preferred it over most of my smaller blades. The textured G10 is nice and grippy allowing for a firm sure grip yet does not chew up pockets. The pocket clip is solid and it holds the knife firmly when clipped. Knife came with a nice edge right out of the box. For the price it's definitely a knife to consider adding to any collection .
Great product.  I usually spring for the higher end screen protectors that require a liquid solution and a lots of patience.  For the price I paid for these they are of a good quality and I would defiantly not hesitate to buy them again .
Fit is perfect and all of the cutouts line up perfectly. Drop protection seems minimal but then again it is not a big bulky case. Overall I am satisfied with this purchase .
Unfortunately the scent itself is nice but the scent never travels past a 3 step radius . I bought both the candle and the diffuser and was very disappointed  with both. The presentation is wonderful but the scents themselves couldn't be any weaker. Although i loved the concept and the presentation I will never be buying anything from paddy wax ever again .
Slightly stronger then the candle but still incredibly weak. I have it in  a small walk in closet right now and to even get a faint hint of it i have to place it near a fan. I've bought both the candle and the diffusers and neither of which have a scent strong enough to permeate past a three step radius. Great design and great concept but the weakest scent i've ever purchased.  You'd have better luck with a glade plugin then this .
My niece first told me about this book. Her husband read it and has incorporated the knowledge into his diet.  He lost 20 pounds immediately and says he feels great. My daughter-in-law, after 1 yr. gluten free, has improved her very serious joint condition in half. The doctor is very pleased.  I'm doing it for better health, not weight.  No more wheat for me .
I got this app thinking that I could just doodle a bit. So I drew a line then I zoomed in then out. After that I tried drawing more but nothing appeared! I wouldn't get the app .
Well apparently you cannot undo things in this free version and you cannot even change the color of the pencil. I think this is a fraud and won't recommend getting it. The screen shot lies about changing the color. I'd give it no stars if I could .
it was exciting at first but, some of the logos I never ever seen or ever heard of. u should categorize the logos from easiest to harder .
absolutely loved these two characters their chemistry is , ,,so hot yet the emotion for colton(his past)  and their love story has me tearing up can't wait for crashed .
This was one of the funniest books I have ever read ..and of course it is it's from a mans POV :) ..i never reread books with one expection this one I def will we need aother Emma .
I really enjoyed this book love danny and Liv and can't wait to start book two still human &lt;3 highly recommended .
This show is great!! I watched the 1st season on Netflix and they did not have season two. So I watched 20 episodes of season 2 on Amazon at $2 an episode and it was worth every penny .
We received the purchase yesterday (3-4-2013), it is beautiful, strong and sturdy. Truly made for the outdoors man. My boyfriend is a landscaper not worried about him damaging this one .
I had a hard time getting the bubbles out of it, I did like that you have a mirror however I do not use this item anymore .
I love this case, I have already dropped my phone like a million times and I haven't lost one rhinestone. My friends love it too, its blinging and it matches my personality to a T .
What a difference htese lights make.They do not come with instructions.  You have to either know what you're doing or do a little research...not that it's hard to change bulbs but a coupl eare a little tricky.All in all I think the difference in illumination is well worth it.  If they make other replacement bilbs, I'm buying them .
Before we get into anything else first, let's just talk about the COVER. The art on this hardcover is stunning, and each super-hero stands out, and yet at the same time none of them are too over-bearing.I will not reveal spoilers about this collection of issues #1-6, because it's actually nothing like I expected it. So, :1). The plot is like a decent Hollywood action movie. (I say this in a good way). Everything is dramatic, and there are pauses in action sequences that a movie would have.2). It reads pretty quickly, but it's very enjoyable.3). Some characters will annoy you. The members of the Justice League don't even really like each other.4). Just like the cover, Jim Lee has drawn a wonderful story.5). I, (personally), feel like Cyborg was just kind of thrown in there. He definitely deserves a spot, (really liked him in the Teen Titans), but they did  incorporate him in an adequate way.Overall, I would honestly give this book a 4.5, but since you can't do that, I just gave it a 5. Definitely should pick-up if you really liked the JLA .
I got this because it would be different from the super-hero New 52's I was reading. Plus, the only version I knew of Deathstroke was from the show Teen Titans.First of all, (like prior comments), it does feel like an over-the-top action movie. But that doesn't mean I didn't like it. There are parts that slow down and explain important aspects of the story that don't distract you from the main story. This Deathstroke also slays EVERYONE. He has no mercy. At first, I had to put it down for a moment, because he really does whatever he feels.The art in this comic was done well, and there are some cool concept features of Deathstroke at the end of the sixth comic.Overall, I'd recommend it to people who want a change in pace, and if you never knew Deathstroke, (like I did), you should get this .
As one of the last Megaman videogames, Megaman ZX Advent delivers a sequel which is at least twice as fun as its predecessor.In this game, you can either play as a Reploid boy named Grey, or a hunter girl named Ashe. They both have their own storylines, and have certain distinct attributes that are highlighted as you play as them.Other than the awesome gameplay, this version of the game has voice actors, which do help bring more depth to the game, (even if it is a little corny at times). It is also interesting to see how both characters interact with Biometal Model A, ( a very &#34;cheeky&#34; one), who allows Grey and Ashe to Megamerge, becoming the ultimate Megaman.To be honest, I haven't finished the game myself yet, because there are a lot of side missions you can do while progressing the main story line. I find myself sometimes as well just standing in a certain zone just listening to the awesome music of the stages. The difficulty of the game is still somewhat difficult, (especially to newer players), but it's doable and rewarding for sure. Speed-running for this game should be a lot of fun, due to all the Megaman and Pseudo-droids you can turn into. I feel that there was a lot of love put into this game, and as one of the last Megaman games it captured some of  the best moments of the Maverick series .
I got this controller because my dorm at OSU my suitemates and I have a 360, ( for Halo), a PS2, (for nostalgia sake), and a Wii where we basically  only play Super Smash Bros Brawl and Mario Kart Double Dash. I needed an official controller to match my friends who had logged hours in theirs. I also like getting high-quality controllers for mu Xbox, so why not get one for one of my childhood consoles?This controller is straight from Japan, even keeping the original box it was sold in at the time. The controllers' color scheme is plain & simple; but almost elegant in a way. The cord is 3 meters long, which is longer than the older GCN controllers,  which is really nice. It plays just as the old ones did; the buttons and the analog sticks work well.Overall, I would recommend this controller because it's from Nintendo and they're running out of stock of official controllers for a very reasonable price .
This is one of the best all around beyblades you can buy. It's the heaviest of all time, and it has 3 modes that it can change into, (although the attack mode and defense mode are the best for this bey), and the attack ring does not scratch. If you can only get so many beyblades, let this be one of them .
after 2 month, one of the headphone is not working, I bought this only because old V-moda after few years is still good. I thought this is going to be same quality but it is not .
Nice mp3 player, good sound, easy to use. Not very comfortable hold switch. And I don't like interface when I connect to computer .
working fine, no problems, sd card reader very comfortable and easy to use. had no problems with it. I'm happy happy happy .
Waiting on the edge of my seat for the next installment.  I like that the reader can be confused about the innocence or not of the characters.  Truly a mystery .
I really love this book it's very interesting and I really enjoyed this book so maybe next time I can read the next chapter. I know that this book was very short but at least I got to read a book because I was looking at some other books on here and I read this other book and then it had all curse words in it and so I didn't read any more and then so I looked at this book and I'm like we'll that looks interesting but yah I'm a Christian so yah and I love who I am...all though I really enjoyed this book homfely I will be able to read the next chapter...neald it bye .
I couldn't believe my son wanted a pair of Wallabee's &#62; I wore them in the late 70s as a high school student!  I guess that goes to show style and comfort never go out of style!Shoes fit great, he loves them.Christine .
This arrived broken in two. Had to throw it away!! Would not purchase again dooo doo!!! Made terribly! Sucks that I spent money on it .
I bought this radio awhile back and NOW i choose to finally review it. At first I loved it, worked great with no problems. Good sound, Waterproof as mentioned, lights and buttons all working just fine. I used the radio in my small bathroom, reception was no issue so I didn't feel the need to write a review. I then decided to take my radio to the beach.. terrible sound. Very faint. I know the beach will minimize the sound because of the wind and all that but the sound was so low i had to hold it up to my ear just to hear anything. When I moved, I took my radio with me and tried to listen to it around the house. Finding reception was terrible. This radio has NO antenna- so imagine, I'm moving room to room going from static to the wrong stations to then finding that right spot where it works! I now hang it in my now larger bathroom, on my shower wall there are two hanging hooks spaced about 1.5'-2' ft apart. When I hang it on the right one- it works. Move it to the left about 2ft or so and hang it on the left hook -no sound! The reception is terrible- point blank .
I bought these for my boyfriend. The picture doesn't do them justice. From the picture they seem to have a orangey shade of leopard. Well- they're not. They are a dark more vintage aged leopard look. Very sophisticated & chic. Not oversized- perfect modest square frames. Looks more expensive in person than pictured. Highly recommend this product .
Cute but not what I expected. When I think of gossip girl beanie- I think of oversized super slouchy beanie. Well- it's not. It's your average beanie- womp womp. For half the price you can get it anywhere else. It's just very basic and ghetto looking. Nothing chic or fashion foward about it .
I absolutely love this lip stick. It looks like it would be some type of purple but it actually looks more magenta pink. You don't need to apply to many coats to see the color. It really pops. I have olive skin tone and this looks great. Creamy and yet moisturizing. Perfect shade .
I just love to decorate with these.They're really small and simple. They don't all face the same way. Some birds look down, some up. Great little touch.I rated it 4 stars because I truthfully think they're a little over priced .
Ok, so after reading so many reviews and seeing that the installation of this pole confused so many people it almost scared me off. I bought the pole either way and I absolutely love it! I cheated in the installation process and got the t.v installation guy to do it ;) lol apparently, they set up a lot of things. I suggest it to anyone not trying to risk having any problems or hassles themselves.Well, the pole itself, is awesome! I'm a beginner, so there's no grace to my pole tricks yet! Glad to see that the pole can with stand all my failed attempts. I climbed the pole and had a friend swing on too. Test of sturdiness!When properly installed, there should be no problems, people :) !Defintely would recommend to anyone looking for a fitness/dance pole that is quality material on a low budget .
I bought this and didn't really pay attention to the measurements, so when it arrived I was surprised on how small it was. Still loved it though. It wasn't just white letters on black background- it has this vintage effect.. worn out- distressed. Looks great sitting on my ladder shelf or hung on the wall .
I love this. It arrived quickly. Applied easily. Looks BOLD, BLACK and no signs of fading of any kind. Its also a funny yet simple extra touch to any bathroom. Love this. Don't hesitate in buying this. Great price. Great, Great, Great .
The brand seemed convincing enough, & the quantity was amazing- but wouldn't you give away a lot of your product too if it didn't work too well?! These tapes are garbageeeee. I've done tape in extensions for years. These don't stick- and are so tiny. Trust- don't spend your money on something that doesn't grip your hair right .
Feels very silky, design is great, very geisha look. It feels well worth the money. I'm 5'4 125lbs and this is baggy even when tied, but that's what a robe is suppose to be like. It hits my knees, great length, not too short. Honestly though, the feel and pattern is to die for .
this lipstick appears to be a shade of light bright purple. ha! far from. I had to double check that it was the same one. I am of olive skin tone. this lipstick looks like a bronze orangey sun kissed look. no purple or pink ! whatsoever. If you want a color that looks like it has brown shades mixed with orange then that's what you'll get. even to get that color I had to put several coats. more than I usually do. Its a great color to go to the beach and have that kimk bronze look lip. but I repeat NOT PURPLE .
I love these glasses. I bought them in black and leopard. They are very large with thin frames. The cat eye isn't dramatic. It's more of a cute chic soft cat eye- instead of a dramatic sharp bold cat eye that thick frames seem to do. They are light and are a perfect fit for my face. I have chubby cheeks and more of a rounder face for a skinny girl. They are very flattering and a great buy for the price. If you are looking for nerd glasses with a feminine, chic edge- get these! By the way- they are not oversized to the point of run DMC glasses. Smaller and more feminine. And the cat eye is very subtle. You won't be disappointed .
Its soo easy to apply, wet the paper and put it up, that simple. It looks great on too. just like the picture. Mines came with a little handwritten note from the seller thanking me for purchasing it. I thought it was really thoughtful :)Oh and I put it up by myself under 2hrs with no previous experience in applying wallpaper. I do recommend you get someone to help you though, the paper is pretty heavy when applying it by yourself, it will be difficult but not impossible to align it correctly. Good luck .
I'm 5'4, 125lbs, 34D-26-38 and this fits perfect (size small). Its not completely form fitting tight. Around the waist area it could be a little bit tighter than what it is for a size small. If you had a 30-32&#34; waist it would be a tight squeeze. Its the perfect length for my height. The color is just as pictured, sheer yet great quality (black .
I love this top. I saw as you open it you can tell its good quality fabric, thick enough to not be transparent. Im a 34D cup and 27&#34; waist- ordered a small and fits very snug. just the way i like it. The girl in the picture must have a long  torso- because the top fits a little longer- closer to my belly button- but just right. can even be worn off the shoulder because of the scoop neck. highly recommend .
the only problem is they don't have enough choices on the length of the chains...thats the only thing i didnt like about this .
its ok but it was not as long as i expected. it doesn't fit the person i bought it for .
it was very beautiful and everything was as expected. My little sister loved it and doesn't ever take it off!! Recommeded to everyone .
Basic book  which is good for recognizing characteristics of codependency and changing your patterns in most relationships. Not geared as much for romantic relationships .
Wayne Dyer at his best! So positive and uplifting. I now ive in a state of love, not fear, and just enjoy my life so much .
I got this for my son who has a lot of hair and has sensitive skin. He loves the product - easy to use - works really well - does not hurt his face or skin at all .
Love it! Wear it all of my waking hours  - it is so easy and fun too - no work required .
Lives up to the hype could not put it down puts a whole new spin on the media reports bravo .
I ordered this pillow at $80 as it said it came with a fill.  The first one I got did not have the fill so Amazon said to return and it and they would pay for the shipping ($30) and send me a new.  The second one came again without the fill.  Pretty frustrating.  Again I was given the option of returning it, getting a new one (?) or finding a fill locally.  I chose this route as I thought at this point it was the easiest.  I went out and purchased the fill which I was reimbursed for.  Seems like a lot of trouble but the pillow is beautiful .
This product had so many bad reviews and I do not know what they are talking about! I loved it! I ordered a medium to be cautious, I am usually a small and xsmall, I am 5 feet tall 110lbs with a booty so it fit tight in the bottom I should have ordered another size larger, so if you are skinny order one size larger and if you are skinny with a booty order 2 sizes larger .
It is a very good Bluetooth device and very sturdy so it won't break ive had mine since February of 2014 I am happy .
It's loose and feels like it going to come.off but I ordered a cleared and I did get that so I'm not that dissapointed I haven't dropped my phone yet so can't say much about protection .
Makes an awful sound nothing like the classic fox 40.  Very disappointing when I blew it and heard this muffled low sound.  Even my students did not like it because they said it was not as loud .
Good quality shirt, does not fad after drying.  Also a thick shirt which is nice because it will hold form unlike thin shirts .
This book was recommended to me as a simple, comprehensive overview of what it takes to win in this profession. I loved it. It had plenty of information but I was still able to easily get through all of it in a single day (I am not a fan of giant month long marathon books). Wes Melcher wrote from experience and, having spent some time with him personally and hearing him speak,  I feel that NetEasy Marketing was a totally congruent representation of his success in MLM. Very Helpful .
this case is very practical and beyond my expection, no bad leather smell, the only insufficient maybe the case is a little heavy,just compare with the kindle, but I'm not care this .
These cups are great for encouraging drinking.  Kids get so dehydrated in the warmer months, having these around keeps them drinking even though they don't realize it .
The book started off strong. As Kaling writes of her childhood and about her growing there is a great deal of authenticity and humor, however the novel did turn. As Kaling writes about her career the book levels off and begins to feel like a less than version of Tina Fey's hilarious biography. The book was a very quick, fun read. Don't expect much though .
Yes this ring is very pretty but after a month of having it, one of the stones on the sides fell out. Of course it was right after the warranty expired so it can't be replaced for a new one. It stinks that I can't get a new one. Its a good price but the ring itself is not very good .
I love the machine but I was billed $79 extra on my card for Amazon Prime which clearly states on my invoice that Amazon Prime was free. I don't know who to contact about this but I am not happy! Beware and make sure you check you aren't billed for the same thing .
Its...ok. the connection wire is not well thought out ...thin. and justd angles about .
I purchased this item about 3 months ago, honestly I was skeptical at chekout. I mean lol 40 sumthin bucks with the free shipping method, gonna prob be a bit cheap was my initial thought. Whelp, I was certainly in for a surprise when the package arrived at my front door. This equipment is to say the least sturdy, bright, and reliable. I've had it for again about 3 months or so and have used it non stop, 24 h and now 18/6 Not a single complaint here. Ty, Oh and I just purchased a second one. I live in Colorado, so yeah.. We gunna be needing many of these inexpensive wonders. Again, thank you Soo much and have a terrific day, Must Have.Sincerely, TheRockyMountainHighs .
Okay, so I purchased this item with a few others, my first online purchase from amazon. I was shocked at how low the price was with the free shipping method, but in the back of my mind I was thinking "this fans gonna be kinda cheap". Whoa, I have seriously used this fan non-stop for the past few months and Not one single problem has occurred, decently quiet but really pushes air and WoW the way it turns is amazing, you'll see. Please trust me, this is a Must Have!! Thanks and have a Wonderful Day .
I bought this pink cosmetic bag a few months ago, and it's perfect for me. It's a little big, but I have a big purse so it's fine for me. The mirror sucks, but I didn't expect much. I'm going to buy another one as a gift .
I got the white shirt with the blue butterfly, and I love it, but it is very transparent. It fits nicely, and is very soft and lightweight, I am only disappointed because I don't like layering shirts, but I don't have a choice here .
I did not install the inverter because I bought it just in case my the LCD cable replacement did not fix my problem .
An amazing story. So we'll written. Can't wait for the next book! No one will regret buying this book.  Brovo .
Game is cool fun and entertaining. Awesome.game must download very cool game for kids teens and adults too. Not they he she it there then back up down .
I found  a pleasant  if not predictable story, I could tell Rosa-lee was going to go through the same thing her mother did  but loved how their forbidden ignited and thought that part was well written.. I also loved how they found a way to overcome the obstacle of her being the ransom for the Falcon and Roberto was a enigma wrapped in a puzzle for her...I loved the twist in the end as well the fact he had his own plan under way was  very well put into the story .
This product was listed as a replacement battery for Acer5732z. It did not fit and it had to be returned. This is a major inconvenience. I will not purchase from this seller .
This product will not seat in the port with my laptop. I t falls out constantly. Do not buy! Not official for Acer aspire .
Half way through the movie it started skipping and wouldn't play. Froze and couldn't get it to work again... Disappointing .
Please don't buy. It takes twice the time to charge.  I used it as aback up for my iPod I left it charging for 3 hours and it didn't even charge it half way .
Cheap hard plastic 1 side stopped working and I only had it for 2 days shipping took extra long alsoNo stars not worth $2 .
I was worried that if I had a case on the laptop it wouldn't slide in, but it fits like a glove!!!! So happy I got it .
I absolutely hated this case!! It was such a waste of money!! I have a screen protector and it ruined my screen protector and I wasn't even able to put the case all the way on. Screen protectors aren't that thick so this case it obviously too small. Don't waste your money .
I bought another case prior to this one and I was so let down so I was already hesitant about gettin this one and sure enough it was just as bad. It doesn't snap on good and the card holder only holds one card. I was very dissapointed as well because the shipper ran over the package so there was a tire mark on the entire package when I got it and it had tape covering a portion of the part that had been ripped open. It was so damaged a corner of the case had a black tire mark on it as well. Needless to say I am livid .
I didn't really see too much of a difference in gas mileage (actually none) BUT my engine did seem to perform better. I have a 5.3 in a Chevy 1500 (80k) if that helps ya .
It works pretty good however, I would not suggest taking the amount listed on the back. It's overkill, you really only need to take about 5 grams a day to see a difference . . . increased muscle stamina for sure .
I have had this watch for a while now and have had no problems. Matches well with different outfits and still looks brand new .
CAN'T WAIT FOR THE 3rd book! Very Cute story!JingleBelle is such a good author! Her name says it all .
In the 30 days that I used the product, my family nor myself saw any visual change in my skins appearance....Was really hoping for more by the reviews and research on this product!!! Oh well, maybe next time .
I was a little skeptical of this product after looking at some reviews and unboxings online. Mostly because they said that there would not be enough room for anything from 120mm fans to a water block etc. Well, I am glad that those reviews were wrong. I just finished assembling my computer (I am writing this review on it) and with a ASRock 990FX Motherboard the water block i have fit perfectly. If a little snug over the ATX 12v plug. Running a push pull configuration on the radiator and had plenty of room. After adding 3 120MM fans (bottom, top, front, radiator in the back) I am getting a Minimum of 8c and a high of 36c on the CPU. Very happy with the quality of this Case for the amount that I spent. The GPU's are held in firmly by the case and has plenty of expansion slots for SLI. Overall one of the best cases if you have a lot of things to put inside on a budget!MOBO: ASRock 990FX Extreme4 Socket AM3+Water Cooling: Antec Kuhler H2O 620 Liquid CPU Cooler System  W/ Push/Pull configRam: 16GB Blue Corsair Vengeance 1600Mhz 4x4Case Fans: Antec LED 120MM x3CPU: AMD 8350FX 8 core Vishera Black EditionGPU: EVGA GTX 660 TI x2HDD: Seagate Barracuda 1.5tb 7200rpm x2SSD Samsung 840 pro 240gb .
I simply love this motherboard, it has integrated WiFi and bluetooth, and has been working with no problems. I bought it without knowing about the WiFi and bluetooth, it simply made everything so much easier. The only problem is that its drivers are way too heavy to download, and the MSI website's download speed isn't a lot .
The survivors book one -  was a fabulous story i would love to see it as a movie. Couldn't wait to read the next book .
Brilliant  i really enjoyed this book and couldn't put it down. Just as good as book one if not better .
*I recieved a free copy of this book from the author in exchnage for an honest review.*This book was a little cliche and predictable. It's a love story that has a twist towards the end and a sad ending and it left me feeling very angry. It has it's way of drawing you in and becoming invested in what happens next. I can't wait for the second book to find out what happens with Ella and Porter.* This review has been done in conjunction with A Girl Amongst Books Blog.

This is a book I'm going to let my 10 yr old read.Wind Warrior is a very easy read and kept my attention. I loved Jon Messenger's view on the elemental powers. I am a paranormal kind of girl and this book did not disappoint. I can't wait to read the second book .
*I was given a copy of this book for free from the author in exchange for an honest review.*This book is not my kind of reading material. I don't know exactly what to expect from this book but it was not what I was expecting. For me, the book was too vulgar. Every time you turned around there was talk of dry humping, princess whore and princess bitch. The plot was exciting though. I loved the ride Morgan went on from dealing with all the girls in his life. It's rare you read a book about an author writing a book.*This review has been done in conjunction with A Girl Amongst Books Blog.

It picks up right where Guardian left off and continues the fantastic story of a love triangle between Emma, Dane and James. And then you throw a little bit of Garret in there and it makes it even better. I was up until the wee hours of the morning trying to finish this book because I just could not put it down. Finally, at 1:30 am I finished it but could not go to sleep. All I kept thinking about was "Wow, How could this author leave me hanging like this? I am not going to make it until the next book." Once again, I'm left with another twist in the story and this time it's right at the end. I can not wait to read the next one .
These have worked great on our iPods.  They haven't curled up and it seems to be kid proof. I would definitely use these again .
It does it's job with keeping the iPod safe and secured but my son can't get it to connect to his ihome because it's too bulky. It's a pain to keep taking the green silicone part off and on. He now just leaves the green piece off which doesn't give it the protection it needs .
I've had my case for not even a month and it's already broke. I can't get my keyboard to work properly and when I went to take my iPad out of the case the corner broke. Now my screen protector is coming off because of the broken corner .
*I was given a copy of this book for free from the author in exchange for an honest review*Vampire Cop is about a cop who gets turned into a vampire while left for dead. He's stuck in a life with only two people, his best friends, knowing what he is. Soon, there's nothing he can do but let his secret out and hope his family will still love him. The plot was very well thought out and I enjoyed it a lot. There is murder, kidnapping, romance and a ton of friendship involved in this story.The beginning starts off very descriptive and almost to the point it was too much for my taste. Then the story line picked up and the descriptions weren't as noticeable as I continued to read.*This review has been done in conjunction with A Girl Amongst Books Blog.

Lisa loves her job and will do anything to make it to the top. She is infatuated with her boss but then meets the hot guy living in her building and they form a connection. One guy is out to destroy her soul and the other is trying to save her. Who will she choose?This book had me completely sucked in and wishing I was Lisa. I would highly recommend this book if you love paranormal. I would recommend this book even if you weren't into paranormal books. The love and compassion that is built in this story is like no other .
Such a beautiful and inspiring piece of work. The description was out of the ordinary that I could see myself engrossed, teary, laughing  and many other emotions. At many instances I could never guess how the story was going to turn. The Cameroon history, Nso culture and Lamnso translations (I actually know a few words now), the literary genre -all these just made  me see the novel as being so educative, interesting and different from the few other novels from African authors that I&#8217;ve read .
Final Fantasy XI captures all of the Final Fantasy elements in this stunning collection. This game has held its own for over 10 years and has not even come close to the end of it's run .
Just because he had  educational  background --does not make him subject to the same biological chemistry  --his delusional trip was all fabricated by his mind --and nothing else --he  said he has all the answers revealed to him  ,yet he never mentions what these answers were ?Also nice way to make  finacial gain --- .
This product gives you more in-game value for less money if you're not looking to buy 50 dollars worth of funds .
Really nice, doesn't seem flimsy at all.  I was able to fit adult size clothing on both rods with no problem.  Went together super easy and holds the weight when the bar is full with no problem.  Will probably end up purchasing more of these for other closets .
I purchased this because i wanted a pressure switch for the Streamlight Pro Tac HL 600L flashlight that i already had. I took a chance that it would work with it, and it does, to perfection. ALL functionality is retained. fits snug,AWESOME! streamlight does not make a pressure switch for this light, which is why i gambled on this one, sure am glad that I did. So, I am sure this product works well for the light it was intended for, However, in my experiences, it works great with others as well. I posted Pics .
I have 2 of these set in a sealed box, wired in parallel for 2 ohm load, and they sound fantastic. Especially since they were 30 bucks a piece!!!  Running 600W RMS Alpine Mono amp, 2F digital cap, Kenwood 6&#34; touch screen head unit.  Custom box was also ordered on here for about 60 bucks. 06 Dodge Ram 1500 Quad.  Perfect Fit!!! Best sounding stereo I have ever had. If they last, It will hands down be the best 130.00 investment ever!! so pleased. wired properly, and with proper crossover settings, these hit every note the book says they do 30-300Hz. And with no distortion, they play loud enough to move the rearview mirror around.Thanks Amazon for giving me a five star stereo for a 2 star price .
Absolutely Stunning Picture!!! I cannot believe that they are selling this set at this price.  I am telling you this panel rivals the W900A from Sony. One big difference though, This Viera is under 900.00. The Sony is more than double the price. If your in the market for a HDTV, stop looking/researching. this is the set to buy .
HAVE A D2 AND DOWNLOAD WAS VERY SIMPLEFROM AMAZON. USE IS NOT HARD AND HAVE TOSIGN UP AND CONNECT WITH YOUR FRIENDS .
I HAVEN'T USED IT THAT MUCH, BUT I FIND IT WORKS GREAT WHEN I DIDI HAVE A D2 AND IT WASNT HARD TO DOWNLOAD OR INSTALLTHANK YOU .
I DIDNT THINK IT WOULD BE AS GOOD AS ADVERTISEDBUT WAS WRONG, I HAVE A D2 AND IT WAS EASY TODOWNLOAD & INSTALLI USED IT AND FOUND IT WAS ACCURATE SO FARTHANK YOU AMAZON .
This Router was suggested by techno savvy people and was easy to set up. Thus far, it meets my needs just fine .
I was disappointed that it was so different from the Tetris game I used to spend hours playing. I did not keep it .
When I check the five D MInt, I can't believe my eyes. There are two D Northern Mariana Island, but I can't find D US Virgin Island. I will return to my country in 5 days. I think the time is not long enough for me to exchange the mint. I think it is my worst experince through Amazon order .
They fit perfect around the waist and length. I've bought Dickies for years and they are the best work pants. I love the permanent crease which makes you look professional without having to iron all the time. I also love that I just wash, dry and hang them up and they are ready to go for work. I see, other people say Dickies run small but this isn't true. If you actually measure them with a measuring tape they are right on the money. In my experience tryng to buy other dress pants made by other companies all the pants are much bigger than the actual size. I was so happy to get them at a really good price and free shipping. I got them delievered to me much earlier than the actul date I was given. Very satisfied with the whole transacton and will be ordering a couple more pairs soon .
It is small and works good for my 5 lb yorkshire terrier but not really big enough to do the 10 lb toy poodles nails. It is made very well and easy grip on handle. Probably really good for birds,cats and hamsters, etc .
mine came in sown completely together and you couldn't even put a gun into it. Horrible choice for a shoulder holster .
Fun game makes u remember things u haven't thought of in years I recommend it to anyone.  It keeps your brain sharp and on the ball .
Beautiful boots but don't expect it to last you very long; it will fall apart on you. I bought it in March 2011, it is now November 2012. I wore it about 15 times. So far, I have lost 3 buttons (one fell off the very first time I wore it); and both soles of the heel fell off. The store manager gave me buttons and heels, but will not pay to fix the heel because it has been over one year and it is "normal wear" on the boots. The store manager was nice; but I do not agree that it is okay for the boot to fall apart after one year and the store or the brand is not responsible. If this was a cheap pair of boots from Payless or something, I would not complain. But I bought a pair of $200 boots, I expect it to last for longer than 1 year. I feel that Miz Mooz has failed to stand behind their product. I will never buy anything from Miz Mooz again because I am disappointed in their quality .
I have a chihuahua and he will not wear anything, but if he has to go potty he won't cause he is so cold. This was a perfect fit and he loves it! he even likes the hood .
Was perfect and he absolutely loved it! Was kinda big but easy to remove links to fit. Delivered earlier than expected and had no issues with the seller. Very satisfied .
The coat fit my little guy very well except that the velcro that holds the coat on and together did not stay latched and he kept getting out of the coat .
this was also broken when I received it, no use in calling on it, I already knew how I would be treated if I called so I lost the money on it and just threw it away .
This treadmill was better than I expected, and with the free shipping, you can't go wrong. It was easy to put together and use, and the box was easy to move into the house without a dolly .
These are a great pair of in ear headphones, they fit and sound great. I like how they never twist up and how they stay in the ear. I would recommend this product .
I purchased this product and its simply superb. i love the leather and the way it save my iPad battery life when i close it. Great product no complaints against it .
It was a good book. Everyone had a point of view, and it provided a good insight. However. there was one flaw in the story... While it was apparant that the author did her reasearch, she forgot one thing - THE FREAKIN PERSONALITY OF THE MAIN CHARACTER. I gave up reading it because as a Laika fan, It was painful to read.According to many resources, the "i hate the world" mentality in this version of Laika wasn't part of the real dog. In fact, it is believed that she was an docile little one, loyal and trusting. This laika also has an ego that was very apparent in chapter 3, while guess what? DOGS DON'T UNDERSTAND MIRRORS. Nor was Laika a sour, sulking pessimist!  Get the facts right! My image of Laika, innocent, naive, patient, little curly tail, was just smacked in the face. Laika was the most patient and docile of the bunch!She was no Katniss Everdeen, she wasn't defiant. She enjoyed everything, acording to reports. Look at her eyes. Do those look distrustful and angry? No, I see an innocent little puppy-at-heart who is as loyal as Buck from "Call of the Wild". And it is well known that on the flight on the sputnik 2, Laika wasn't as calm as she was in here. Her poor little heart was beating three times as fast as normal, and she died in agony, being baked to death. If you want to read a more true to character story, read the graphic novelLaikaby Nick Abadzis. Laika's and Albania's personalities seem to switch, and our heroine's charming innocence makes the reader feel for our little angel. This book is just like when my LA teacher modernized the story of Orphius: exept the fact that Laika is REAL, making it alot worse.So basically, this book exels as a story and novel, but NOT as a biography .
Really happy I went ahead and got this. I have always kept diagonal cutters in the tool kit in the garage, and not with me and the guitar. So I'm searching for cutters when I change out strings. Excellent cutting side, easy tuner spinning, just an all around excellent tool Get one .
These shoes are always perfect. Can't go wrong with Birkeys.  They a comfortable and last a very long time. I wear them for everything in the summer .
Camera arrived to be used by our dematologist office. The camera leaving a dark spot image on pictures.. We purchased a replacement camera and filed for a return on 11/19/13 the date allowed per Amazon policy. We did not hear anything and filed again for the return. The Video & Audio Center has refused to take back this DEFECTIVE CAMERA . DO NOT PURCHASE FROM THIS COMPANY .
We love our K-cup drawer.  I didn't want another thing to put on the counter like the K-cup tree.  The drawer seemed sensible and it certainly is.  The Keurig fits nicely on top of the drawer and all the K cups fit in it nicely.  It is attractive and keeps everything organized.  I would never give up my K cup drawer .
only for people with baby like fingers it didn't fit the top of my finger the measurements should be more specific .
Was looking for a decent zombie book to get into regardless of the writers political affiliation (I don't know why that would even be an issue as stated in other comments) and I was not disappointed who gives a flying s*** about every little grammatical error the book was great got me hooked can't wait to read the next one .
A rootin tootin good read, while there were maybe too many characters to follow it definitely wasn't impossible to follow. Eagerly awaiting the next one .
was super duper excited to receive my nerd sides guilty pleasure of MechWarrior table top miniatures the only thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars was a missile rack was busted off of my condor tank :(  -but nothing a little modeling glue won't cure!!!!! thanks .
I had been looking around for this for ever. Not sure why I didn't check Amazon sooner.Worked great and nice quality.The bulb will break if dropped (not too surprised, but actually expected)....Still works after replacing bulb .
It works as expected.I am not sure what to write for a review about this.It fits, it has the correct space and nice quality.Love it .
Not sure what to write for a review.But this worked as expected. Plugs in and charges my laptop.The plugs fit perfectly .
Nice to have and this app does work.But if you are concerned about security of your wordpress site, using XMLRPC would probably not be a good thing .
It fits and protects as you would expect from a case.but what I did not like is that the chrome looking pieces easily come off .
Plants verses Zombies (PvZ) is an app that everyone needs. Its as necessary as having a web browser.If you don't have it you are really missing out .
Works great. It does stick out a little (maybe a 1/2 inch), but nothing really to complain about.all in all, it fits, charges, and lasts as expected .
Its too bad that the ink that comes with the printer when you buy it doesn't last long.Not sure where you can go wrong with this. Its the manufacturers ink .
How can you not like this game. It is a classic.If you don't know what pac-man is, I am sorry for you.This is a good game and it works .
Easy to install and did not over bulk the phone.Basically worked as expected from a cell phone case.I'd recommend it .
This product was ok, but turns out that the phone was not exactly anything close to quality.If you half to have this phone, then this product is great.But avoid the phone at all costs .
This was complete junk.The parts did not fit what so ever.The two pieces were mirrored to the phone.Everything was backwards .
I have read other reviews about this product. But I have not experienced any of the negative things mentioned.Fit my macbook air model just fine. Nice and tight :-))nothing broken. I love the soft touch .
The battery doesn't last more than  minutes off the charger smh.. this just isnt right to sell tarnished merchandise to your customers.. now i have to purchase another battery .
great for kids, durable.  The only thing that I do not like is that you cannot clean it very well, lots of dust, dirt, crumbs that get in between the screen and frame .
Huge Waste of Money, the chair looked a lot better on the screen than it looks in person. Poor craftsmanship. Screws have been driven through the leather on the bottom of the seat, The tan color looks like dirty and not at all like it looks on screen. For this much money, the assembly instructions were in one tiny sheet (even worse than your normal IKEA instructions). I got this for my husband as a gift and i regret this purchase.It says sleek Norwegian design, but I swear you can find something better designed and without tear in the leather at your nearby furniture place for a lot less. No warranty card or any other items arrived with the box. I gave it 1 star since I had to give some rating for the review process.And before I forgot, the box arrived damaged, so after much anticipation we just ended up with an expensive disappointment. i got this from amazon since we have shopped many times on amazon before and always been satisfied with the purchase. Lesson for us: Never buy expensive furniture without seeing it first in a brick and mortar store .
Great show we love it.each show gets  better and better we can't wait for season 4.and i hope for many more seasons to follow .
Don't buy Pantothen if you have oily skin it did nothing for my oily skin it actually made me break out around my cheek area and doesn't get rid of blackheads .
The book came quick enough but I absolutely wouldn't say it was in Good condition and gently used as was rated by seller. I'm embarrassed to give it to my daughter...a new one is $162 and I only paid .01 for it but was charged $4.99 to have it sent to me. It looks like one I would have picked up at a garage sale for a  nickel. I wished the condition was rated lower .
I didn't read close enough and thought I was receiving three for $12 like the picture showed. My fault, but can't believe $12 for a little piece of plastic and a small pad of sticky notes. Wouldn't have bought if I would have read correctly .
This is so cute. It is rather thin and is meant to be used rather gently as apposed to a make up bag that gets stuffed and tossed from one handbag to another. I'm using it as a wallet to hold just a few cards and cash. Definitely can't overstuff it but that's ok for my purpose and it's recycled which is great and has a good message .
I love this! However, other users of my bathroom did not find this as humorous as I did! It was very easy to put on and I received it in good time .
well I just love my PF flyers and got the leather ones for such a deal I couldn't go wrong.  If I had too say anything negative it would be that I dont think people with wide feet would like them.  I also will share a secret to keeping the leather pf flyers soft, supple and looking brand new...........I use vermonts original bag balm I just wipe a small amount on a paper towel and wipe it one the shoe and it works especially well for this shoe, in fact I use bag balm on all my leather shoes.  but yes, love these flyers so much I ended up going to their website and buying another pair because the ones avaiable on amazon you can bet the cutest flyers never seem to be available in my size lately, so if you cant find your size try their website .
I have to say I have found the fitflop ankle boot to be one of the most comfortable shoes I have ever owned and I have a bad knee and foot problem and I wasn't even shopping for shoes the day I came across them in a Marshalls. I thought they were cute but the best part and boy had I only known was they were on sale and I got them for the awesome price of $35 bucks.  Once I realized how happy my feet were I went back and they didn't have any left so I went online and oh my, if I ever can find them for that cheap again I will buy every pair they have in my size.  You have a great shoe people but jeez, a little pricey.......and I was checking out your sandals but personally, I think a person has to be making good money or be plum nuts because I will never pay 100 or more dollars for a pair of flip flops even if they are made by fitflop.  If you lowered your prices I could honestly say I would by nothing but your brand but I consider myself ahead when I can even buy new shoes, so hopefully as I continue to surf I will come across another pair for a decent price but so far I haven't found the ankle boot anywhere for under 65 bucks.......but I will keep looking a while longer before I break down and pay the price .
got these for my roomate for christmas.  He is handicapped from a near death car wreck in which his legs and feet were so badly injured he almost lost them.  Before his accident he had a big foot, like a 13 and now with his problems from his accident his feet are deformed and usually swollen pretty badly and he walks on the outside of his feet really bad.  no one has been able to find him slippers that fit.  I bought these in a 15 triple E and I won't say they are good looking, how can they be when you have feet that big but by golly they fit him the only complaint is they look like you are wearing them on the wrong feet but for someone with the problems he has and the fact he should never walk barefoot because if he cuts himself he doesnt heal easily and he cant feel it anyway if he does so he wears these to walk to the mailbox and stuff like that.  we were just happy they fit .
I got my first pair of Sanuks while on vacation in Florida, grumbled over the expense wondering how long they would last.  I also have a tumor of the nerve endings in my left foot which can cause me alot of pain and has created some deformity with my middle toes.  Well I am incredibly impressed, first at how comforable they are, you don't even know you have shoes on sometimes, and I am astounded at the abuse I have put my sanuks through and one year later they have been through the washer twice and they are still in great condition and I love them. My feet love them .
couldn't go wrong for the price, cute belt with different colors available,  I like them and it looks like they will last awhile too .
I wanted an alarm of some type for my 125cc motorcycle.......didn't want to spend a fortune and its a vintage bike so I didn't want anything that involved wiring, read the reviews on this and they were all so positive I figured it was worth a try and it more than exceeded my expectations.  It will even fit inside the side covers if I wanted but I have it attached to the back of the seat with velcro strips and really it looks like its part of the bike.  The alarm is really loud and it goes off only if the bike is actually tipped or moved so I know if it goes off someone has had to do more than just touch it or brush alongside it, it is being moved.  I am more than pleased with the purchase and a couple of my friends now want to order one too .
I like it but it does not stay signed in for me and that just makes me mad! I am just saying. but I still like it .
I bought a pair locally, so knew how they fit.  They look like a boot but don't have all the upper boot.  They look great with jeans and have had many compliments on them .
I have to revise my review for this product. It is a crap!Data transfer is not stable. Unexpected disconnection frequently happens.I have tried three new hard drive with it but have the same syndrome: Unexpected disconnect. One time, it disconnected when I am encrypting my data. It totally ruin my data from the hard drive.Be aware what you are buying .
im using the pills for one week now i could see a big different i take 2 in the morning midday and at night my face feels so smooth im not a shade lighter its just one week bout im getting brighter i stop using my whitening cream cause im getting better result with this i wasn't taking it with vitamin c so today i started taking it with vitamin c so i will write a review again soon .
before i try this soap i was scared that im not going to get any result but in one week all my spots were gone everyone telling me how im getting so bright this soap is magic it burns alot thoe after washing the soap off ur face it dosen't dry my skin cause i use a cream after but if ur looking for a even skin tone this is ur soap .
I liked breeding and taking care of the fish, but it would stop working if I breed a lot of fish quickly and didn't let the graphics run it's course .
You just feed and take care of a brown blob. There isn't a lot of changes you can make unless you have a lot of coins that you get when you play. I didn't really like it, since it got annoying after I kept getting notices from my pou to clean, feed, turn off, and on the light .
Great app would highly recommend it! Very challenging i couldn't get through level 3 without help its, a great game to play with a friend .
I ordered it for my at&t Mega. AND it didn't fit. This is the second case I ordered AND it didn't fit .
i own a napa store and we ordered this camera for a customer  it was working fine when she left and we have not heard any complants so far .
I didn't know these things existed. My wife now lets me allow this dogs to jump on the bed! Nicely covers our white comforter .
I don't advise this lead for those who are serious about handling dogs. The clasp is small and will not attach to a large collar. It is also very hard to attach to a dog in a hurry .
I wasn't sure I could wear something crammed between my toes for long. However, I wore them with comfort all day and didn't even notice them. I have noticed that my feet feel good and the product seems to work. I hope they hold up. I am on my feet a lot .
This watch is not water resistant as advertised. Condensation gathers on the face with exposure to water. It is also flemsy .
Not just for children, but an older reader is sure to enjoy it just the same. The readers are offered a brief history of each form of transport, an array of facts, records and speed information to go along with wonderfully clear photographs.  The book is an interesting read, with 20 different types of transport being discussed, from a simple tricycle to a space shuttle - readers will certainly enjoy this fun and educational book .
for the price its okay, the pics don't come out very clear, and its not so easy to figure out the settings .
I think this is good for people who need some help with words. I definitly am not trying to sound mean .
This air bed is so comfortable. I would just lay on it and fall asleep. So far holds air wonderfully. Inflates in minutes. I do t know what else to say, JUST GET IT! Lol. You will NOT regret it .
Another amazing song by Jamiroquai! I can not wait until the next album! So have White Knuckle Ride on one of your devices that you can listen to music on. Because you won't regret it .
This was such a great purchase! The price is just right for the quality and quantity. I got this on 11/23/12 and it is VERY warm for a sheet.`The only thing that disappoints me is that I thought there was 2 pillow cases, but that is nothing to be worried about. I'm so obsessed with Sonic so this was just perfect for me .
Temple Run 2 is an extremely fun sequel to Temple Run! The graphics are simply amazing. There is more obstacles that make it more challenging. The game is brighter then Temple Run. This  game is very addicting and I cannot stop playing it .
The game is really fun and has good music too! It is tricky so it is not like other golf games .
This was to me not up to what I had hoped for the ending left me hanging and need more to round it out .
Though someone said that this material of crocs are not so comfortable as the traditional ones, I just it's ok. But my feet is 24cm. this one is a little big .
Once I receive this, I give it to my daughter(17 month old), she seems not so interest in it, but after one month later, she like this gummy fish, and she can eat 3 once. I don't know why .
like, no like much but is my color prefered and ndsskdjksndfnfjksdf  asdn sakidbias dsdbasid as ds d udua dsd sidsu dasdbsid as dd duasdv asd .
Funny and inspirational story about a disfigured child and how others view him and how he views himself.  It is a great book about accepting others no matter how they look.  It is a great teaching tool for kids in elementary school.  A must read!  My nine year old also was laughing out loud in parts.  It has helped to make him more sensitive to what others may be going through .
The movie would freeze so much mu family and I couldn't watch it im not sure what was wrong with it we tried different dvd player's and it did the same thing :- .
I so loved this book!! I couldn't leave it down for 5 minutes! I recommend this series to all my friends!!-K .
THIS PRODUCT CAME TO MY HOUSE LEAKING MORE THAN THE NILE RIVER!!!! IT WAS WET ALL OVER THE PACKAGE, AND THE PACKAGE WAS DAMAGED!!! THE WATER SPEAKERS DIDN'T WORK BECAUSE ALL THE WATER LEAKED OUT AND I WASTED $30!!! I ALSO ORDERED THEM IN NOVEMBER AND DIDN'T GET THEM UNTIL JANUARY!! I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS FOR ANYONE .
Mister T ain't got nothing on this crew. I can sit and watch thing movie all my life, as a matter of fact I think I will .
Bad TV, won't pick up anything. Believe me you pay for what you get and I got nothin. Do not buy .
Who cares how old it is, it is beyond a classic and if you don't love it then something is really wrong .
Awesome program!  Can't wait for the next season in January .
I am an African American woman with VERY VERY thick and curly natural hair. I swear by my Brocato Vibrastrait iron. I have owned this iron for 2 years now, and I have never, never had a problem with the product. I also got it on sale at Ulta and was very excited about the price. It's AMAZING! I don't know what I would do without it .
backpack was damage in a right right it was ripped & also it takes so long to come So I do not like my backpack .
It broke within the first couple of days.I had it for four days at the most.This product is not worth the money .
This product truly did not live up to the expectations, or advertised results!  Will not repurchase.  Do not recommend it .
I've had Buffalo external drives in the past and haven't had any problems with them at all. I decided it was time to switch to something more compact and with a higher capacity. So I opted for the LaCie Minimus. Big, big mistake! In fact, I bought two of them, so I am double the fool. They look good and solid, small compared to my other hard drives, and come in a heat-reducing alluminium casing. These are the only positive comments I can make. I bought two of these things, less than a year ago so I could transfer all my work data and personal downloads. They have hardly been used, and have been kept safe and secure when not in use. One of them has stopped working completely. It just won't come to life and be recognised on my computer. I am not prepared to fork out 400 quid to have it extracted, if that is indeed possible, and if I return it to LaCie they will format it so the data will be lost (unless I pay their service a fortune to have it extracted first). I won't be using a LaCie product ever again, so whether to return the disk is a moot point. Now to the other one. An annoying point about LaCie is that the drive needs formatting before first use. Buffalo never did. They were just plug and play. This second drive tells me that it needs formatting before use, however, it was formatted and data was stored on it from another computer months ago. Properties tells me that the drive is empty, so where has all my data gone? These drives are 100% unreliable. If you care about your data, don't touch this shoddy product with a bargepole! You have been duly warned .
Was in good conditionJust wouldn't snap together as easilyHad to take it off an on a few times to make it snap right.Other then that still have the case works great an very light .
awesome stuff! apply with a mitt cause it will turn your hands brown real fast but blends well. super long lasting, no weird smell, perfect shade and doesn't fade off weird. will be repurchasing .
This album and Neighborhoods are the two worst blink 182 albums ever. I can't tell Neighborhoods and this album apart from AVA .
I heard about this product through a friend.  She gave me a few samples to try and now i'm hooked. I can't sleep without them! They are awesome! Now I can get good sleep .
I'm 17 and I discovered I had inverted nipples a few years ago. I was pretty embarrassed about it, but this product has been incredible. I've been wearing the nipplettes for about six weeks and I see dramatic changes. I had moderately inverted nipples (one more so than the other), and they've been mostly corrected. I wear the product for 8-12 hours a day, and you can't see the cups under the majority of clothing. While they didn't stay on well at first, I bought lanolin cream which helped with the suction. After 2-3 weeks, my nipples filled the cups completely. While my nipples initially reverted soon after I took the cups off for the first couple of weeks, they are now everted most of the time, with the exception of a small slit (I'm hoping this will disappear with further use). I've recently skipped a day or two wearing them, and my nipples remain out but with a flat top/more pronounced slit. The cups hurt a little at first, and there was a bit of clear discharge, but I've developed a tolerance over time. I'd suggest re-suctioning the cups every few hours because the nipple tissue takes time to stretch out. Overall an amazing product that I'd recommend to anyone with this problem! I look forward to even better results over the next few weeks .
I love the bedding, however "Case of 6" means 6, not 1.  I can get one of those for half that price at Target.  Completely deceptive .
This hay is quality hay at an excellent price.  I have 4 guinea pigs and this hay is their favorite hay, it's not dusty like other hays, and it's so healthy for them.  They love jumping in and out of the box to eat it .
This case does not protect ur ipad... I dropped it from 2 feat and the screens cracked... Also the rubber lines don't even hold the I pad u set it in an angle and it just slips .
I'M REALIZING THE ALL AMERICAN DREAM OF FINDING A JOB TO RETIRE FROM IS A THING OF THE PAST. IF YOU WANT TO BE IN BUSINESS FOR YOURSELF BUT NOT BY YOURSELF IN MLM THIS BOOK IS A MUST READ TO GET YOU STARTED .
I was &#34;hooked&#34; from page one !I felt as if I got to know each character personally and found myself rooting for Jedidiah's football team over Blake's !I also got a kick out of reading about all the local places the kids would hang at.I loved the Gospel being proclaimed through out the chapters and through the characters.I highly recommend this book not only for teenagers but also for parents of teenagers, youth leaders and the like .
Smells very good, u can't smell da bronzer but u wont get dark. Cheap n works well.. smells very good .
By far the best book in the crossover series...so far. :) can't wait to see what's in store for us next .
So goodYou should buy it now SO good can't stop readingSo good SO good SO SO SO good .
So good can't stop reading it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!NIALL IS SO HOT AND FUNNY AND SMART .LOVE ONE DIRECTION SO SO SO MUCH Love this book .
Lost sleep over this book. Would not stop until I was done. Realistic. Any parent can relate. It absorbs you .
I love the book. I could not stop reading it. Kept me looked the whole time. Best book ever written .
Haven't read this good of a book in months! Recommending it to all my friends. They love anime. Great book .
very cheaply made. For the price that you have to pay for it. I would not recommend it to anyone .
Wasn't capatible with any.of the older equipment In my house and.picture quality was less than expected audio was very good tho .
I chose the grey because Black was not available in XL. The amazon plastic said XL but the tag on pants is L. Very long. Being taken up 3-4&#34; I am 5'4&#34;. Pant is very thin but still comfortable. Tight in the wrong L size but wearable around the house .
Cover was cracked upon arrival. Still using it, but wondering how long before the crack gets bigger and doesn't allow the cover to stay on. Should have figured it would be less than great for the price .
I'm not sure how this product would work since it was the wrong thing-but they had excellent customer service I would give them 5 stars for that .
it does exactly what it suppose to do.  i love it.  haven't lost internet since i hooked it up going on 2 months now. i was losing connection  1-2 times a day before .
Works well, comfortable and slimmer than most knee straps. No complaints. The only thing I found wrong with the straps are that they get caught on your clothing, peeling the Velcro back .
funny poster kicks ass on my wall makes my room look really awsome and for the price its not at all bad lol .
didn't work horrible. didnt form a scab watch youtube videos for one hour on how to do it plus read the instructions still wouldnt do it and the thing is im almost out, and i heard its impossible to return it .
its horrible i saw this at a store in seattle and i haven't seen anything so cheesy and stupid in my life its worth around 300 not 53k and dont be a idiot in buying this picture a kid tipping that over and it breaks yeah its better to buy a corvette with that type of money then this pathetic excuse for a stereo speaker system .
well at first i thought the v-neck was super deep and i wanted a black vneck shirt so i can look like terry mcginis from batman beyond lol, after ordering from doublju and other companys a simple v neck shirt was aparently hard to come by well this is as close as it can get, im 5ft7 155 pounds and im a slim body big arms kinda dude and i ordered a size small, wich fit me really well, its comfertable and soft at first i didn't like it but i got used to it and i love it now! and the vneck is actually a little bit bigger then it shows in the pik, if you dont want the vneck to look to big just pull the shirt a little back towards your back, i dont know seriously why some people are complaining just shows they dont got style .
well my fiancee loves this and i ordered it for her, she says that all the years she used this it never builds up on the eyelashes and its so easy to use, umm give it a try i don't know why some have those very negative reviews i never seen my fiancee with clumps in her eyelashes, theirs a difference in using it normally, and using a gallon of this stuff a day lol. good luck .
well this is the first time ordering from doublju and i gotta admit for a cheap price its perfect! the shirt fits nice, and nice quality the skull buttons are kind of a metal/plastic feel to it, its perfect because i hate metal buttons their to heavy and they break off real easy, the only reason why i didn't give 5 stars is because it came in a little lighter color but i think its my fault because theirs different types of the grey color, if you see other people complaining how big or to small it is, their just complaining because they might be on the big side/small side. im 5'8 145 pounds slim, and the small size shirt is perfect for me, ill be ordering from this company more often .
luv it although the chain kinda feels wierd its like more metalic and feels more like a spring, its not flexible at all, i just switched it out with a other necklace and put the L on it and i always kepted getting compliments .
well it ifits perfectly and the date said it would come on january 4-january 22. but it came december 28! wow great shipping speed! :D oh yeah the other thing is its not white it is more silver looking thats the only thing i don't li9ke about the earing .
well i used this hair wax before and its always best to get hte ultimate spikes and stiffness i love this product! way better then crapy gatsby! this can make any style come to life! and its not sticky nor flaky nor wet looking it dries the minute you put it in your hair! and you don't have to worry about your hair bending after applying use! try it out you wont be sorry .
its perfect i bought this for my fiancee because she is into hello kitty stuff, and she is 19 and 5'3ft. i bought a size small, if you guys read any product reviews how small or how to big it is, they didn't use the chart, either that, or their fat, its like a slim fit, for girls that look like that in the picture, im a 21 year old male, and i got it right, people are just to picky and b*tchy. if you get it to small blame yourself, other thing is its for girls that are fit/kinda skinny, not for obese girls .
omg this shirt is one of my best shirts that i have! im 5'7 150 pounds and i bought a size small and all i gotta say is that i love it i go out and i get compliments all the time, its a little thin but thats whats this shirt for, its for those cloudy days, not winter -_- lol. its a true slim fit shirt its not tight nor is it wide like most american shirts are. thats why i buy from this company all the time. a must have! i have already washed it 4 times and its still the same .
The product I got was NOT the product I had thought I ordered... It was a see-through case that was barely green. I knew it would be a gel case, but the case was not what the picture had said it would look like. The case is alright, but unless you are expecting it, I wouldn't order it. Honestly, a waste of my money, even though it's fairly cheap .
This case is super cute, and I use it very often, but it's kind of thin and my iPod has fell out of it before. It doesn't have a place to put your iPod on the charger, so when you are charging it, you need to remove the case, which really isn't a problem since it falls off so easily on my iPod. Even though it's slightly large, I really love this case and use it all the time .
The stickers are cute and all, but they are a real hassle to get off of your home button! Since it comes with 6 pieces, I was excited to be able to swap them out every now and then, but they are really difficult to get off and leave a gross residue behind. Also, if you don't put it on exactly right, (a problem I had) The home button will not work properly and it's really annoying. Honestly, I don't like them, and I don't use them. They may be cute, but they are a pain in the neck .
Super cute online, but when I got it in the mail, the "stones" make it look cheaper than I thought it would look... But for the price I got it at, I can't complain! It's a big necklace that compliments a plain shirt and stands out; I've gotten a couple compliments on it. I would buy from this company again and I enjoy wearing the necklace. It's definitely cute for a couple bucks .
The design is excellent and not causing any pain in the ears for longer usage. I would recommand this to others as well .
Crisp and tasty in my martini. Not mushy as another brand I tried. I only wish this were available locally to save shipping costs .
They came rolled up in just paper and tape....they were mangeled and ragged...They won't stick and keep curling up.Very disappointing .
Excellent....I am very pleased with the quality...very heavy...the cut is very nice....for the price...it could not have been better...I highly recommend this .
For the price you can't complain! Although for a large room you may want to order more than one order as that's what I had to do .
I didn't especially enjoy it.  It has been so long since I even went back to it that I can't really remember why I found it lacking .
Just not my type of game .
I am extremely happy with mine, they are quality and they don't cost much at all. I have recommended these to everyone I know that shoots, they have tried mine and before I told them what I paid for it, they said they wanted to save up for one. I hope this helps .
Love it. Fits under the sink and gives me more room. It is expandable and goes around the pipes with no problem .
Our dog loves the treats, Yummy  Chummies, but the only thing is we did not get as good a discount as we had gotten on previous orders.  This brand is made in the USA which is a HUGE plus for us when we buy our dog any kind of treats or food .
this didn't fit my 2010 cbr1000rr even though I was informed it would nor will it fit any cbr1000rr and it is a 520 not a 530 .
The product was not as it appeared on the internet.  The colors were much &#34;bolder&#34; than they appeared.  When I looked into returning the product, it turned out that the shipping would be nearly as much as my refund, which I would receive only if I met a number of criteria, i.e., ship USPS first class, apparently there was a reduction if the product has been opened, etc.  Overall, a very negative experience -- .
I bought this product but I don't like it because is missing the conection cord and I don' know how to connected .
I'm a big fan of Cecelia Ahern I love all of her books and this has not failed to deliver yet again  :- .
my phone would not accept the connectionwith this kind of Bluetooth.very disappointed for the phone that i needed it for. but it worked on another phone fie someone else .
A true marriage of sweet and salty, the Reese's cup merely needs one word: delicious.This irresistible treat was packaged well, did not melt, and provided my mouth with some much needed lust during exam week. Thank you Amazon .
Probably the best beginner's camera out there that produces quality photos at almost laughable costs! I bought mine used for $60 (body only) with a kit lens ($40) and the f/1.8 50mm ($80). Combine all of that, I have a $180 dSLR to learn from until I have the money to purchase a better body. The previous reviews have hit the jackpot on why you shouldn't get this camera, but I'm here to tell you why you definitely SHOULD.1. Ability to upgrade to the hacked firmware[...] (guide to updating your 300D: [...]- Enables Custom functions menu- Enables Flash Exposure Compensation using SET button- Enables SET button function when shooting (to change image quality or shooting parameters)- Enables Shutter release w/o CF card- Flash sync speed in Av mode- Enables RAW+JPEG rec. Enables setting the quality of embedded JPEG- Enables Mirror Lock up- Enables the ability to select the autofocus mode: AI servo, Oneshot etc.- Enables setting ISO 3200With the updated firmware, the camera is completely customizable, and you'll be able to learn all about how to create the best shots2. Using manual external flashes. I bought a used speedlight for $30 and have been creating unbelievable images using bounce flashes. Who needs e-TTL2 or whatever anyway? Go with manual and learn the right way!3. It's more about the lens, less about the camera body. With a tremendous lens, any SLR will produce amazing photographs. Sure the ISO quality is terrible with 800 ISO or higher, but programs such as Adobe Lightroom and filter programs will get rid of some of the noise. The sensor is not as larger as the newer models, but with the external flash, a tripod, anything you can do with your $700 dSLR, I can do with my 300D.4. Best of all, this camera is faster and, simply, better, than any of digital point and shoots. I have a modern, 18MP megazoom camera that I use for mobile reasons, but it has nowhere the quality as the 300D.5. Buy a $5 external CF card reader and you won't have to deal with the USB1.1 speeds.6. Who cares about the small screen and the slow preview times? You can take thousands of photos on RAW at a time with a 4GB card - just review and delete later on your computer .
Bought this little guy to use in my laptop for my old toshiba 600GB HDD as an extra hard drive to store music, movies, music, documents, etc. following an upgrade to a 120GB SSD. The 120GB SSD runs Windows 7, while the HDD with the caddy serves both as a backup drive, storage drive, as well as a bootable Windows drive. My laptop is a custom Sager, but I'm sure this can fit anywhere.Shipping -I have Prime, so I one-dayed it, and it came in one day. Thanks Amazon!First impressions- Fast! It didn't slow down transfer speeds of my old toshiba drive whatsoever. Combined with the power of the SSD, my computer now runs extremely fast.- Supports IDE 2.5" HDD to be used instead of an internal IDE optical drive in an older laptop needeng an extra HDD while CD/DVD/Blue ray device to be used externally via USB2/3 or eSATA.- Provides 4 screws.- Had a modular structure - can find a way to fit in any laptop, unscewing extra plastic parts designed for IBM laptop along its edges or even remove the rear connecting plug to IDE, allowing to use the classical connection underneath.Cons- Flimsy plastic.- On the rear edge there is no choice to screw in the original attachment fixture which were used for internal laptop optical drive - I had to fix it with only one screw. But since entire unit stays put inside laptop - I believe that one screw is just enough.- Since the caddy was thinner than my BluRay drive, the internal parts of my laptop is exposed. I guess I need to find a cover somehowGreat tool for anyone who doesn't need an optic drive and wants extra data to be placed in a drive inside the computer rather than externally .
I was tired of 2 minute bootup times, minute loading times, and just waiting while files transferred.Bought this little guy to use in my laptop that was using an old toshiba 600GB HDD (now it acts as an extra hard drive to store music, movies, music, documents, etc on an optic bay caddy). The 120GB SSD runs Windows 7 with many applications installed - including one game and many work-specific applications, while the HDD serves both as a backup drive, storage drive, as well as a bootable Windows drive. I have around 10GB free of the 112GB total. My laptop is a custom Sager, but I'm sure this can fit anywhere.Shipping- I have Prime, so I one-dayed it, and it came in one day. Thanks Amazon!First Impressions- Came in a nice box with a desktop bay. Since I didn't need that, it goes into storage.- Install was more than easy. Simply take out your old drive, insert the SSD, place the old HDD into an optic caddy for a laptop or another slot on a desktop. I did a clean install of Windows 7 using my old passcode and a USB drive - took less than an hour to get up and running.Pros- Blazing fast speeds for booting up and shutting down (10 second boot-up until I can load up an application and 5 seconds shut down)- Great read/write speeds (took 12 minutes to install windows 7, 3 minutes to install Matlab)- Loads any application in a fraction of a second- Great transfer speeds for USB/external hard drives on USB 3.0- No more "waiting" or "loading" screens on a game like Call of Duty- No sound- No heating issues- Resistant to dropping/shock due to the fact that it doesn't have a spinning disk like most HDDs- Longer battery life (almost 4 hours now with a 15in screen and web browsing, up from around 3 hours)Cons- The fact that you haven't gotten yourself one yet!Notes- Make sure to switch the SATA ports to AHCI in bios before you install the OS on the SSD. Otherwise the drivers will not install properly and you'll have to reinstall the OS again.Great tool for anyone who doesn't need an optic drive and wants extra data to be placed in a drive inside the computer rather than externally. This, hands down, is one of the best investments you can make when building a PC. Sure, capacity isn't the greatest, but your system runs like a champ. This SSD gets a 7.9 with Windows built in benchmarking, and loads Windows so fast the logo (at boot) doesn't have time to assemble the Windows logo completely before leaping to the desktop.My laptop:Sageri7 quad-core 2Ghz8GB RAMKingston 120GB SSDToshiba 600GB HHD in optic caddyNVIDIA 540M .
Stylish simplicity. I bought this wallet in the color purple, and not only was it great looking, but felt great and has been also durable.- Easy to open, comfortable, and completely genuine leather, it keeps your essentials - ID, credit cards, and cash - within reach and secure.- It has a nice flap closure that snaps shut and tightens pretty well.- Since it's soft and flexible, it can expand quite a bit for your receipts, makeup, whatever else girls keep in their wallets.- Leather exterior and antiqued brass-tone hardware give this wallet a luxurious look.- My girlfriend kept it in a medium/small sized shoulder bag and it fits very nicely.- I'm sure it can also just be carried on its own. The wallet includes a polyester lined interior with a bill compartment, zipper pocket, credit card slots, and an ID window.Measurements:Bottom Width: 7 1&#8260;2 inMiddle Width: 7 1&#8260;2 inTop Width: 7 1&#8260;2 inDepth: 1 inHeight: 4 1&#8260;4 inWeight: 6 oz .
I have purchased this item because I wanted that volume with that natural look to it. And it really did give my hair more volume to it. This product is best used when hair's dry, to allow the product to do its work. At first the price made me not want to buy it, but a friend recommended it and I was like "Lets give it a shot". And its really worth your money. With this product, help me boost my confidence as a person overall. Definitely buying more when I run out. AMERCIAN CREW FIBER FOR THE WIN :D .
It is definitely worth the buy, and this shades will last me my whole lifetime, if don't lose i haha .
Amazing sound quality. The fresh, clean, and white look makes it look fashionable and great to used everyday :D I've been trying to find headphones that are simple and not to flashy. And this headphones definitely suits the criteria of what i have been finding for a while. Definitely fast shipping and worth your money. It's just what I wanted :D .
I've read most of his books. This one was good, like all of his books. I am just so hooked on all the Sigma-Force books and their characters. I have not read the books in sequence though. Sometimes that helps for continuity of the characters. It brings you up to date with where they are, who they are with etc. This is a winner in my book .
I literally count not even stomach to read the whole book. It was so poorly written and it lacked immensely on detail, not to mention there  is no story line. The author appears to be in a rush and it shows. I would never recommended this book for anyone above a second grade reading level. Pitiful .
IT WAS A GOOD PRODUCT BUT DIDN'T FIT MY TABLE THE DESCRIPTION WAS NOT RIGHT AND SINCE I HAD TO OPEN IT TO SEE I COULDN'T RETURN IT .
The PHP6 and MySQL is an excellent reference book. Other books do not show us how to interact with database software. I recommend this book for help when no one else able to help with database connection issues. Listen Amazon, I will not sell my PHP6 and MySQL book ever .
Very bad book. I would not recommend this book because it does not teach. It brags how well they are. I wonder why college administrator require use to use this book. I hate this book .
This book is a pleasure to use as piano exercises. In addition, this book assists one to play harder songs with the exercises. Piano player is like sports. You need a work out. The subject book is an excellent work out for piano finger playing .
Excellent. Amazon, I will not sell this book. I have more than one copy of this book and no one will get this book .
Listen Amazon, I will not sell this book. I have more than one version of this book. I will use as a reference to share with students in my computer science classes .
People are not aware that there is a spiritual realm  The senseless violence and murder from fallen angels who are evel. Hollywood do not inform movie goers that there is a real hell.  Try reading 13 Minutes in Helll .
I will not sell my copies of this book.  I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in Bible prophesy .
I believe I have most of Perry Stone writings. I watched his televised programs every week. I can not wait to meet him in heaven. I will tell him and his wife how fund I am of them. As a teacher of Bible prophesy, he breaks the mold .
This product works well with personal computer towers, but it does not work well with laptops and netbooks. Microsoft Laptops and netbooks prefer Microsoft's security software. Norton works well with my computer/Window 7 and Window 8 towers .
it's a good book, i liked it because i felt like it was speaking about me, i would recomend this book for those people who feel that they don't belong from where they are .
I have not had the opportunity to use these fine tools.  As expected,  these are precision quality tools.  I will resort to their use in applications where back probing is not practical and I am confident that they will perform perfectly.  They arrived promptly and I am very pleased overall .
The design and function of the tool exceeded my expectations.  I used it to obtain the power, signal, and reference ground measurements from the MAP sensor in my truck by back-probing the connector.  The plastic body of each probe is well molded and easy to handle, plus, it accomodates the standard banana plug from my DMM leads.  The spare needles and recess screw are an extra feature.  Some of the needles have very slight markings (not gouges), but these are from the manufacturing process and did not affect their function.  I only mention this because it was discussed in another review.  In fact, another website on the same product says that you can install your own pins on the tool if you wish.  Very well designed .
These are probably the thinnest back probes in the market.  They slide in between the wire insulation and the seal without causing any damage.  The varied angled probes allows you to choose the one best suited for the job at hand before resorting to wire piercing.  The versatile female end connector accepts a standard DMM lead banana plug for a short-proof connection.  Or, you can use the supplied plastic insulated alligator clips.  They arrived sooner than expected.  My experience with Lisle is that they strive for practicality, not fancy-ness .
tablet fit to tight in case and not made for my tablet....just don't like the way my tablet fits in the case .
Truly a twist ending, loved every bit of it!  A quick read too, started and finished in one day because I couldn't stop reading .
Not happy about having to lose every thing to upgrade!  Hours of entertainment. Just wish we could choose different levels or different places .
Quick shipping item was as described. Only problem was one of the new items were damaged inside the blister pack. But they still work and I didn't buy them for appearance .
Balderdash the Dragon is a work of fiction by a writer that I reckon has the most exciting career ahead of her, and a fan base that will definitely grow and grow, demanding more and in the years to come, stand queues for her latest release!  Bernice Mills has a way with words, that's a fact. And from the first paragraph to the last word, this thrilling adventure sweeps you away to a &#34;magical world&#34; that is as believable as Middle Earth and Hogwarts.  Overlooking that this short story makes you wish that it had been a 700 pager, reading it is a pleasure I have last felt when I finished the final chapter of the Deathly Hallows.  The characters are believable, the dialogue sweet, and the story, well, simply put: fantastic.  Balderdash the Dragon is a superb choice, a lovely work of fiction, and I can't wait for Bernice Mills' next book .
This book kept you wanting more.  Couldn't put down  because you wanted to know what was going to happen. I would suggest to anyone who loves happy endings and loves weddings .
I usually don't use mechanical broadheads, but I heard and read a lot of good things about the rage slip cam heads, so I took the plunge and dropped the cash. The cash I dropped was well spent. I like that they give you a practice head to see how the head will affect your arrow, and in my opinion, the actuall heads fly a bit better than the practice head. I have yet to see the damage on an animal for myself, but from some pictures I've seen, these rages inflict some insane trauma on deer...some of the sheep we have here in hawaii have thick hair, and sometimes it looks like wool. I'm not sure how the wool will affect the head, but being that the blades deploy from the rear, I do not see the wool being a problem. All around seems to be money well spent .
Super fun and has different types of songs. some slow, some quick some sad some happy.  Listened to is many times in a day it never got old .
I love this,it's not so easy and it will challenge your brain.I recommend this for anyone.I play it on breAks at work refreshing .
The soap I got works really well. It wasn't fake and it last a pretty long time. I am very impressed with the product .
Let me just say you get what you paid for. I got it on November and the paint hasn't chipped off yet (except for the part that was missing when it was delivered). It protects your phone pretty good. I haven't dropped my phone yet so I wouldn't know if its durable .
The case is not a hard cover case. The 1 I got is rubber. It looks just like the description except its just one whole case. It still protects my phone very well. Also there isn't a part for you to switch turn your volume on/off you have to move it over .
This thing's button switch broke within 2 days.  I think I clicked it on and off four or five times.  The rubber switch cover tore off.  Get a mag-light.  They're not much more expensive .
Absolutely loved this case but it had some minor damage when I received the case. Easily fixed with glue but lost a star because of the damage .
came just like i bought it at the store myself in plastic and wouldn't you know it no scratches can't ask for more .
talk about a product that never fails to impress and holds up to the test you can't ask for more really .
wife uses this 3 times a week and sure enough follow the directions and bam bye bye blackheads her face cleared up in two weeks to no blackheads period .
Bought this for my wife for christmas (she has very sensitive skin) and proceed to use it first day directions were kinda misleading didn't really say how to apply and the company website doesn't give any hints. after contacting a friends wife (certified Cosmetologist) we learned you just lightly moisten and tap it in the crystals and bam your on your way. should only be used once every other week tried it on myself 3 days in a row.... paid for it dearly face was red for a week .
After graduating from high school, I began putting my schooling on hold, at first I told myself that it was because I didn't have enough money, or not enough time. It was after 2 years of sitting around feeling sorry for myself that I realized I lost the motivation to do anything with my life. I came across this book by pure chance, and now my life has changed. I gave myself goals and I worked at it everyday. Now I have a Major that I feel truly passionate about and a job waiting for me when I finish school. Do yourself a favor, read the book, find yourself again, just like me .
I have to say, I was having issues with women, I would go out on dates with women and would call the next day hoping to go on another date. Not only did they NOT answer, the next time I would see them it was like nothing ever happened! Now I am booming with confidence. I no longer need to call Women,THEY call me! I highly recommend giving this book a shot, I'm just stunned on how well these tips work and for so cheap its like the author is giving the book away .
So for the longest time I would use cragislist to buy cheap things that I could use for myself. It never occurred to me that I could buy things that people didn't want or were selling low and resell them to earn a profit! I wish I would have come across this book sooner, just thinking back on all the deals and potential money I may have lost out on makes me cringe! I am really excited to actually use the knowledge that I learned from this book and put it to good use, time to make some money .
I have been interested in goal setting for a long time and came across this book. So I gave it a shot and I have to say the techniques in this book are not only powerful but they work. Very Useful .
I was having trouble sleeping at night, and since i work a morning shift, this was a big issue. This guide actually helps, I got lots of helpful techniques and info on how to fall asleep faster and sleep soundly. I feel more awake now during work and no longer have to rely on countless cups of coffee or energy drinks .
This book has helped me overcome my depression in a big way. I never thought I could start living a happy life. This book has opened my eyes. Very Useful .
I've always wanted to purse my hobby of writing short stories and this kindle book actually helps you with a lot of small details that you normally wouldn't even think of. And it literally doesn't take me long to write a full kindle book! At first I wasn't sure how to even write a proper book, I'm glad i gave it a shot .
I needed to earn some extra money on the side, and since I didn't have any extra time working two jobs, helping support a family of 5, I've decided to try to learn how to make more money without doing anything more than once. This book will teach you what you need to know to not only keep your head above water, but keep some to the side for yourself, and perhaps buy a few Christmas presents .
This book has made training my dog easier then I ever thought possible. The author teaches you easy to use techniques that are not only simple but powerful if you are looking for a great guide on dog training look no further. Thanks .
I ordered this because my original iPhone 5 charger broke. When I plugged it up to my phone, I got a message saying it wasn't compatible... I'm not sure if it's iOS 7 or the brand, but it does not charge my phone .
exactly what I expected and a good size.  Glad I can wear it whenever I go watch the celtics play .
Already does not work, I had to go back to using my old one that fades in out that I bought at best buy probably will go back there to get one .
Pretty nail polish.  I believe it goes great over other nail polish though, it is a bit light, I wouldn't use it alone .
Works perfect, I was able to download pictures from my camera to my sony tablet with no problem.  Perfect fit .
they are small but very cute, I didn't want anything big so they were perfect. I did change the backing of mine just because I don't like the catching it had .
Best bumper ive bought money well spent it fits nice and is very strong it exceeded expectations and i haven't taken it off for weeks .
I love this song. It's a new single for Marc, but it's so catchy how could you not like it? Just makes you want to get up and dance around lo. I feel that you're not a true Puerto Rican unless you have some Marc Anthony in your playlist. Ha .
This stuff works. I got so tired of my picks slipping in my fingers. Gorilla Snot is very sticky, and washes off easily. I'm happy .
WHEN I WAS SEARCHING FOR IT WHEN I GOT IT HOME THERE WAS A DEAD FLY IN IT.IT WAS NOT NEW IT SAID IT WAS .
I bought the hat as a gift and he lives it now he says he wants a nother one I don't blame him .
Thank  you for the best price I didn't have to spend weeks on other sites.i like the external drive feature .
VERY NICE HAPPY NEW YEAR  THE PRICE WAS FAIR TO . IT WAS FOR A CHRISTMMAS GIFT IM NOT PURCHASING ANYTHING TODAY .
I have been an endurance athlete for over 8 years, about 4 years in I found CFE and Brian Mackenzie and I have never looked back. The book is the summation of what they have been talking about over the past 5 years, and is t he core of my training and philosophies when I train personally, and how I coach others, and have gotten great results and used CFE methods all the way up the the full IronMan level .
I ordered these under the assumption that this was a 10 pack of these springs, like the Wiss P406 spring pack I received. I only received 1 of the P407 spring, but was charged the same amount as a 10 pack. I'd like to get the other 9 that I paid for please.After attempting to explain the situation to the customer service rep at Amazon...I received 1 more spring. That still leaves me 8 short of what I thought I ordered. I won't be buying from Amazon again .
This movie was a spur of the moment thing one night when my wife and I couldn't find a movie to watch. We ended up choosing this because one we are both anime fans and it sounded like a good plot. I never suspected that this movie would be so beautiful visually, and have such a powerful story.This is definitely a must have for all anime lovers. My wife and I loved it. We did the 7 day rental, but plan on buying it as soon as possible. Great for all ages, there is one small scene of not even partial nudity, it's tasteful and does not even have the typical anime feel. My wife and I thought it was a great movie of love, loss and strength. We love it and will probably watch it many more times once we have children of our own .
Works great! nothing wrong with it. I love it :) Shipped in only two days! I am very happy with this invesment .
This was such a great gift to give to my college friend. We get lots of use out of it. Its bigger than i expected and just perfect. The only thing i could say that is wrong is that some of the plugs leak, but i mean when everyones drinking its doesn't really matter .
I wanted a tool with just the basic functions and this tool fit the bill. I love the blade steel and the pliers are not as fragile as I was thinking they might be. Awesome EDC .
We have two cheese slicers and the only thing that goes bad is that the wires break and there is no way to fix them other than to replace them. We have already replace one .
OK for scratches. Not OK for cracks. I did try on the crack but to no avail. Any other ideas .
When I received my frame it was plastic. Very poor quality, the clear plastic part was cloudy and scratched. I won't purchase frames from them again considering with shipping I paid $105.00 .
This is a great case and keyboard combination for a Samsung Tab 2 7&#34; tablet. The case is low profile and fits quite nicely. I also liked the magnetic latch used to close the case. One nice feature is that you can charge the tablet while the case is closed. There is a small support built into the case to prop up the display so that you can work at a table instead on having it on your lap. I bought 2 of these for my sales people to protect their tablets. It comes with a USB charge cable for the keyboard that can be used with the Samsung wall adapter that comes with the tablet. You might even be able to get a USB &#34;share&#34; plug to fit the adapter so that you can charge the tablet and the keyboard at the same time. But the keyboard stays charged quite a bit longer than the tablet, so that probably won't matter .
Works great when it works. Great idea just wish it was dependable.  Sometimes sound quits and sometimes it just won't work .
i haven't finished the book, but what i read i found it interesting and very helpful to get ontrack in eating .
I cannot understand why  Samsung  designed a case  that cannot hold the spare battery and the charger :  I had to buy a larger  camera case in a store to be able to bring the spare battery and the charger  with me .
This book is amazing!! I've read it twice and I still can't get enough. It's devastating that there will be no more books made in the series .
The phone case came faulty, I disliked the way it was packaged. Also, the main in convince was it broke after a few days with little to no usage. Very unsatisfied .
These seeds did not even germanate.  I bought a packet for a farmer friend.  She had no success either.  We were both terribly disappointed .
I found the page very easy to navigate and to make payments.  BUT, I wo nder what is my due date?  I was charged a $26 late fee, but had no idea  I was late .
Worth every penny! So light and comfortable. Great structure. Nike knows what they are doing. Great design. Cute on my feet too! I can't wait to use this pair for running .
Doing this painting was enjoyable. Took 3-4 days to do. My girlfriend said she couldn't tell the difference between the finished painting and the box cover. Definitely one of my best works .
The TV came to me fast and quick. Hooked it up no issues. I got the HDMI hook up from my PS3 running with NETFLIX. The only issues I have is sound crackling or pop-ing. I can live with it, slightly distracting but other than that a great buy .
description makes mask seem like a full mask its closer to a 3/4 with a elastic strap in back and the paint on the mask specifically the mouth was horrible. the bottoms are pretty decent quality fit well accorrding to the fitment guide. the shirt of the other hand if your a bit bigger guy the extra padding in the shirt doesn't help anything. There does appear to be a bit of a built in pocket in the padding for storing wallet and phone, or what not. i'm 6'2" and for the most part everything fits rather well some modification may be required to make it fit me specifically. for sure recommend getting a different mask though .
This book was great!!! It was such fun to read. I can't wait for the next one. Definitely a must-read .
I liked this book. I can't wait to start the next book. I hope it's as good as this first one .
I love this adaptation of the classic fairy tale. I can't wait to read the next four volumes! Loving it .
Super quick read, but thoroughly entertaining! Definitely recommend this book to all Stacy Justice and Toad Witch fans. Can't wait for more .
So glad I waited until after all 3 were released before I started reading them. I can't stand the waiting. Really good plots though. Can't wait to start the last book .
This game is so much fun! I cannot find another slot game as much fun as this one. I completely recommend this game!!! Try it for yourself .
Love Star Wars and Angry Birds, so this is the best of 2 things I love. Can't wait to show my daughters, they're gonna love it too .
These books are sooooo great!!! I can't wait to find out what happens next. I love these books. A must read .
Lots of fun and very affordable. I can't wait to unlock the next game. I love this game. So much fun .
I love this game, but it would be better if occasionally the words weren't missing the last letter which makes it a bit harder .
my husband is just starting a job as an Upscale Security Officer in a mall. We had fun with this movie and we also like Kevin James. not sure why the movie had to cost $9.99 though, that is too expensive for an old movie like this. I won't use the service again at that price, this was an exception due to the situation .
This show delves into relationships, trust and testing of everything you think may or not be right and what you will do if you had to. I really like this show .
This series has it all, love, hate, fame and fortune, good looking actors, storyline that is not always predictable and best of all, the music! I really like the song lyrics and the interaction while they are writing .
I never received the book. Maybe I have a tablet, no computer. I couldn't get it, I tried many times, I don't have it, also no pri ter .
I couldn't put the book down. The art work that was talk about made you picture in your mind what clue was revealed during the story. Trying to figure out who was the teacher and who was the good guy and bad guy. The book keep going in different directions. Great action and kept me wanting more .
I have seen his way of coaching when I was I high school. I didn't understand the reason why until reading this book. You get a better inside of the Coach. I don't always agree to his way of thinking but understand a lot better. Great way to turn negative thoughts to positive actions .
Kept me wanting to know what was going to happen next...didn't want to put down the book...made me think about my life, family, and friends and not take things for granted .
Enjoy the book. I really enjoyed how the story kept you going from one suspect to the next. I like how the author included trusting Jesus during your everyday life. Can't wait to read more of her books .
Everyone should read and try to live by what the Bible commands....Made me realized that I need to try and live better.Even if you are not a sport fan, this is a must read book .
I like John Grisham books and this was no exception.  Very smooth reading and keeps your attention.  I enjoyed the book very much .
This was a good book, very interesting.  However, there were times it was a little disjointed and difficult to read.  I like a storyline that goes along smoothly and this did not seem to flow .
People say this is oily, but I have dry skin and this make my face look a mess. Do not like it no matter what the price .
I just remodel my daughter room who just turned 13. I looks so beautiful in her room. No issues with the product staying on the wall. It has been up there since May 2013 .
I saw a bed bug crawl to it 4 days after I lay the trap down, but the bug just went around it and did not go in the trap. I end up killing the bug. I was hoping it wound have got in the trap and get stuck. Lucky, I saw the bug so it won't go anywhere else and lays eggs in my room. It say check the trap daily, so if a bug comes out and go pass the trap  you would think that you do not  have any bed bugs due to none in the trap. This is just me, but I check the trap every 5 minutes to see if I see a bug go pass. It's a little frustrating checking the trap every 5 to 10 minutes all day hoping that you didn't miss a bug, but will continue with my spray treatment as well .
I looked on you tube how to put this up and it was easy. The directions to me was not good so I went to youtube. Looks great on her wall .
I bought this from a store back in April. The av cord and the power cord both crapped out after 6 months. I went online to customer service and they sent me new ones since it's under warranty. Well 5 weeks later they didn't arrive. Went back online to their customer service and they were never sent. Now it's going to be 3 to 4 more weeks of waiting. There is absolutely nothing else they could do. Customer service sucks!!!!! I asked them about overnighting and they said their distributor doesn't offer that option...what!?!?! If you're going to buy this product I would definitely recommend getting some extra cables ahead of time so you don't end up with a long car trip in your near future and no way to get cables, since they don't sell the cables in any stores .
Pretty comfortable, at first I thought it would be a bit too tight but it fits perfectly. The sound is good and almost all outside noise is blocked which is a bit uncomfortable if talking on skype (can't hear your own voice). Sometimes theres static in the headphones (which might not be its fault) but all in all, the headphones are okay .
Recieved the purple bundle instead. Couldn't be bothered to ask for the blue one so I kept the purple. It's not bad, but I expected different .
Great stuff.Nothing equals this product for feline dental health.Excellent treat and easily digestible.Too bad this product is not available in my area.My cat loves it .
I'm really disappointed by this product. I run a boat tour business and refill my boats regularly with gas. Avoiding marina fuel prices saves me a lot of money, so I was more than willing to fork out the money for the "Super Siphon." Sadly, what seems to be a really good valve comes connected to a cheap, flimsy, soft plastic hose that cannot be kept from kinking multiple times between the gas can and fuel tank. Fuel flow cannot be established, and the product is useless. AVOID.Update: I cut the cheap hose off of the valve and replaced it with a good quality piece of hose I got from the hardware store. Works like a charm now .
Not as much support as the shape ups. Skechers needs to find a medium here they may not tone but really help with planterfascitis .
I don't believe we come from monkeys. If we did we would act like them too. God made everything the heaven and the earth .
A typical Melissa and Doug toy. Made very well and my grandchildren love them. Love buying Melissa and Doug...no disappointment .
This is the best product that I have used for cracked skin. It has been wonderful. I was in the printing business for many years and had to constantly wash ink off my hands. They were always cracking and I couldn't find anything that worked as well as this SBS 40 skin cream .
I'm upset by the product, I first came to the second damaged screens phones are Chinese are not samsung Original galaxy have external antenna and no equipment Original S3 brings, exigo I reimburse my money since q ue phones do not work and are damaged .
Had this product for about 3 months now and have not had any problems. I would definitely recommend this product .
Nothing technical about it, fits right over remote. Would of given it 5 star if it fit a little more snug over the remote fob .
I don't know why, but it would not work when the XBOX was hooked up with HDMI cable, had to use the RC jacks in order for it to work.. weird .
I would recommend, only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because the leather started sagging a little bit. Other than that, i would strongly recommend .
After having problems with those charging type cases that just wouldn't work right, I decided to go with just having a larger battery. One full charge seems to last me at the very least 2 full days without having to re-charge (with constant use). In most cases I don't have to put up for a re-charge till the 3rd day. Yes it is a little bulky and heavy, but I don't mind since the phone kept slipping out of my hand anyway. I would definitely recommend this product to those who don't mind the added weight or size of the battery .
Max Lucado said it best : &#34;Brennan Manning does a masterful job of blowing the dust off of shop-worn theology and allowing God's grace to do what only God's grace can do-amaze.&#34;This book will change your life ! The peace that comes from knowing, and being so wonderfully reminded, that God loves us just the way we are and not as we &#34; should&#34; be ! For those of us who are bent and bruised and feel our lives are a grave disappointment to God, find the peace and comfort offered within these pages. They will transform you and you'll never be the same .
The Wire was, upon my first viewing in it's' initial season, the ABSOLUTE BEST series I have ever viewed.~ great characters AND character development !~ GREAT writing; getting a retired Baltimore police officer involved was a crucial decision. Gritty, spell bounding, and drama NirvanaIn a nutshell, STILL the best series in the history of television. Snot boogie indeed !!!!~ antagonist, protagonist, rise and call of action, foreshowding ! Heck all the literary elements are present and accounted for !My recent plunge is my second viewing after a long separation. I'm picking up dialog and character interplay that I missed the first time around. The acting isn't outdated...folks watching The Wire for a second time is like finding that special tshirt that you'd thought you'd lost- comfortable and pure bliss .
It just didn't have the recipes I was hoping for. I think this is on me, because I should have read the description more carefully .
I have always loved entertaining and baking.  However, I would get lost in the words of other cookbooks and feel overwhelmed right from the start, and give up. Not true in this case, this book held my attention right from the start. I truly feel like I can take these recipes and make the desserts shown in the book, and have them turn out absolutely delicious.  Jenny gives you the basics right up front, she lets you know the core of what you will need, and builds the recipes up from there.  Very helpful for the super beginner baker, like me.  The table ideas are beautiful and she makes it easy to convert to any celebration.  I only wish I had this book for my son&#8217;s First Birthday .
Holds phone great! Look is adorable!!!!! Dropped it on a concrete floor and it took all the shock. Phone didn't touch the floor. love it .
The picture does not do this doll justice.  It's adorable!  The fur is soft and the stuffing is just right.  The condition was great and even the box was in good shape.  There were a lot of precautions taken to protect it when it was mailed.The only thing I didn't quite expect was that the voice isn't in English (Meaning instead of saying &#34;Snivy&#34; it says something along the lines of &#34;Do-jo&#34;).  It's still very cute regardless.  The soundbox is voice activated, and it varies on what soundclip is played.  This lets you have &#34;almost conversations&#34; with it.TL:DR - This doll is a MUST BUY for Snivy fans .
I was amazed by the Harry Potter series and was looking forward to the adult offering from this writer.  I was a bit disappointed, the characters were less rounded and more stereotypical, the moral messages were less clear and the writing less spell binding.  This was a good read, but not what I had expected .
Right place, right time.  This is a lovely little read.  Short, sweet, to the point and not intellectually challenging.  Lovely Kipling short story .
This is an absolutely stunning portrayal of just how much cyber bullying can effect others.  This has a realistic plot with believable characters.  I have met these kids so many times - (in reality with different names) - they are not the 'kooky' ones, but the silent majority of our school population.  Read it and you will also want to share it with your friends and colleagues.  Well written, poignant, hard hitting and just such a great read .
This book is very popular with spiritual people and is beyond words. Such great books do not need a review and cannot be reviewed .
the clock was good but when i plugged it into a adapter as i am in australia and we have 240v it got hot and won't work. if i buy another one how can i use it here .
I was very pleased. I had ordered my ink and i contact them and  told them that my order never came after a month had passed .they quickly put another shipment out and i received it in a very short time. Will always do my ordering with them .
This phone is perfect. I love it. Just what I ordered and it is a very good product. If you are interested in purchasing a corded phone, and you DO NOT need the caller idea, I recommend this one .
This cushion does eliminate a sore tailbone on a long or short drive. However, I feel my underwear bunch up around my thighs. Because of this phenomenon, I prefer to use this cushion for a long drive when I really need it. For a short drive, my tailbone is not a major factor. On a short drive, I am not so tolerant of the underwear bunching up. On a long drive, I prefer to have a relaxed tailbone  and I forget about the bunching up .
No offense but this game is terrible I put my finger on there 3 times and saw different characters I did it a forth time and they just keep repeating if you get it it's a waste of time .
Amazing book. A journey taken not only by these kids, but with your heart also. Grab the Kleenex box. And check out the web page .
Lol Philemon meets final fantasy meets TCG.  Why is not to like? Super fun and I am extremely picky when it comes to games, but this is a great surprise .
This fit well alittle hard to hook but once they are in I know they won't come out unless I pull hard to take them out. I did have a problem with my order it gor lost in the mail somewhere but once I contacted the company they sent me news ones right away at no cost to me. I got them with in a few days! Thank u .
It fits well and I would buy more from here. It was what I wanted it to be. Not for lager girls though .
I did have a problem, I only go three out of four straps but when I contacted the company they sent me another strap of whatever color I wanted at no cost to me! I got it with in a few days! Thank u .
I have to admit I was a little put off at the first bit of the book with elmore being so general in his descriptions of generations. I'm from gen. X and most of what he said was true whether I wanted to hear it or not! As a teacher of 17 years teachig all ages...I've struggled with "why is this student so movtivated yet won't do the specific hard work to get there?!" And "what happened to children's attention spans?!" Etc...this book really helped to address WHY these things are happening .
I'm reading comments like "if you want to become a concert pianist this book is not for you...bUT if you want to play for enjoyment this is great!" Reality: as an adult you are not going to become a concert pianist...but do you want to be stuck plunking away at chords/melody sounding like a child?? There is such a thing called "in between" beginner and concert pianist. This huge area is intermediate. Learning piano the way Scott presents it will keep you stuck at the beginner level. It may bring temporary enjoyment but eventually you will get bored and want to move forward in your learning. He disregards the importance of fingering and  technique amongst MANY other things therefore creating bad habits that are VERY HARD to break. If you skip over these you will get extremely frustrated and probably quit. As a professional teacher of 17 years I've seen this time and time again. Learning an instrument is NOT easy and requires much more work to succeed than what the general population thinks. It's incredibly rewarding and as an adult CAN be done! Do yourself a favor and get a teacher trained in pedagogy. You will learn everything Scott is trying to teach but without the grand lack of important skills that will enable you to enjoy playing music forever. IMPORTANT: you can learn to play quickly if you WORK at it and have the right teacher! Our society is tied down by " instant gratification"I'm not an "old school" teacher and there are others out there that understand the importance of getting an adult to play quickly so they don't lose interest and feel defeated. However , a trained professional can teach you in the way you learn best without skipping important lessons that could possibly inhibit your progression of learning. Bottom line: this is a money making scheme. stay away from quick and easy if you really want to gain the true fulfillment that playing the piano can bring .
You can buy much better fake books. Also: just google the song you are learning and "lead sheet" and up will pop the chord changes. Not to mention its FREE. This guy is such a gimmick .
There's a review posted on Scott's paperback book "play songs like a pro whether you've had lessons or not..."The review written by a "hunter_aran" is the perfect summing up of this garbage. I just couldn't have said it better myself!He posted under 2 stars September 17, 2009 .
Please don't waste your money. This guy is out to profit from people's ignorance. If you want temporary....let me emphasize temporary...enjoyment then buy it. If you want to learn and actually progress past children's songs get yourself a real teacher that has experience teaching the "adult beginner .
Broke within a month of use. Not satisfied with the quality of this product. Wld not recommend this product this product .
This was a very interesting book hard to read at times but so true on so many levels. IT made me want to reach in the book and help that sweet little boy i couldn't put it down .
I really loved the book. She's such a brave woman for being able to write a book about all the horrible things that happen to her and over come it move on with her life she's just a amazing person. It made me so sad that she not just missed out on 12 yrs of her life but she never got to see her son grow up I really could feel her pain. The book was so intense I couldn't put it down and after I finished it to this day I still think about it. I recommend this book .
I received my package early which I like and the packing was great but for the product I didn't like it just didn't do anything for me. The reason I bought it was that it had such good reviews but I might be one of the few that it doesn't work on .
Haven't had any issues with screen protector as of yet and have to say that it works very well. I work in a very harsh environment and it hasn't scratched like others have. Time will tell if it holds up .
Very concise book, listing very specific messages with good examples to support them.I'm not sure any company could work like this; but I'm pretty sure my small one could .
The talk button is very stiff and it hurts my ear.  Also, the sound quality is not very good.  I only used it for a little couple of days then got a different brand which is great .
One cartridge produced less than 500 pages out of 2600 and the other cartridge will not work in my printer.  I am very disappointed with this product .
This read like a Harlen Coben storyline.  Kept me on the edge of my seat and wanting more!!  I have never read anything by this author before, but I sure will now!!  Highly recommend it for anyone who likes drama, thrillers and mysteries .
This was my least favorite.  Would have preferred it in bling! and it is  not so easy to find in my purse .
its nice it looks and feels good and its a wind up clip but there are cons like the charger makes a buzzing sound its all plastic and the wind up clip doesn't work all the time and the whole front sight is all orange which you can easily paint and you may have to oil the outside of the clip so it goes in and in and out better but i do like it. some pros are looks really nice the back sight is adjustable good long lasting battery goes fully automatic and its very strong i would think its around 300 fps great for a beginner and even with plastic bbs it still is strong. I would suggest you get it .
its truly fabulous, its great, and i love it. though the only reason i give it a four star rating was because it goes through the co2 cartridge really fast and the slide on top of the gun does not go forward when you finish the clip. its a very good gun has a little recoil and has a good design. if your planning on buying this i suggest you do .
this is probably the BEST!!!!! full metal spring gun you can get. the shipping was great and it has great detail, and accuracy. its double action but it doesn't shoot when you pull the hammer back unless you pull back the slide. the 2 mags that it comes with are almost entirely made out of metal and is hi cap that holds about 90 bbs. the slide has an opening ejection port and the sights are great but you might want to put white out on them because its hard to see during the night. the slide lock doesn't work but if you pull it out a little bit it work. its a great gun and i recommend it to any beginner or someone who just wants an awesome spring gun so what i'm saying here is that you should defiantly get the gun .
its a nice replica of a ppk and its good for beginners i would recommend it because of the cheap price and other things which ill write. the grip the trigger the mag and the inside of it is mostly is plastic but its not such a big deal. the downside is its very hard to cock especially for people who are not that strong so if your gonna get this i suggest you work out a little. sometimes the gun jams you can tell it did if the slide is staying back, its easy to fix take out the mag and pull back the slide a couple of times and a bb will fall out then its unjammed. the whole barrel is orange but not such a big deal. yes, I'm writing a lot of downsides to the gun but its strong maybe 220 fps so it packs a nice punch and the slide and other parts of the gun is metal which is great its a nice gun i recommend it for strong beginners and not a beginner and its a nice james bond ppk looking gun .
now this knife is great though of course there are cons and you can't do anything about that. but the reason i did a 3 star was because the it says it comes with 2 but when i got it in the mail it only had one. i called amazon i got it worked out. they sent me another set but it also only came with one so called again before i returned the first and again i worked it out. now the pros and cons.cons:water can get inside the handle if you put it in, but not a lot.doesn't come very sharp but who cares i fixed that easy.sharpening stone is very thin and hard to use so doesn't work very well.compass is s***. but who caresthe last con isn't so bad but its stainless steel not the best for knives but who cares and i suggest don't use for divingpros:awesome knifecomes with every thing in the descrip and picslove it works great .
For the cost this is a pretty nice cage, if you have a dog that will try to get out of the kennel, then this is not the cage for you, it is not the sturdiest of cages. I had to buy some extra clips to put on my cage when I leave my dog in it just so he can't open the latches. But its big and fits my 70lb labrador with tons of room left in it, sometimes my weimaraner sleeps in the kennel with the lab because its big enough to fit them both in the cage. But the labrador doesn't try to destroy the cage when hes in it, if he did then this cage wouldn't hold up. If you have a mellow dog that will just sleep when he's in the cage then this is perfect .
This is the best screen protector I have ever used. It doesn't Bubble up like other screen protectors do if there is any lint on the screen, and you can wash it and re use it again. My husband and I have had ours for about 5 months now and they are still working great. Definitely reccomend using this product. It is worth the money .
I like the color of the case, but it gets dirty and shows marks really easily. And the cover for the keyboard came already scuffed up a little, its still cute and like how it looks on my mac book but wish it would have been newer looking to start with and didn't get dirty so easily. But I still am using the case after a month of having it and think it makes the lap top stay better protected. Overall I like it, but am not in love with it .
Love the color and it protects my i phone, I have dropped it a couple of times and not a scratch. Very happy with the case so far .
I am returning this case, although it is so cute, it doesn't fit correctly on the I pad. It covers up the sides of the screen and you can see or select anything on the screen if its in the corners. Huge pain in the butt, I tried it for 2 days and hated it. If this fit correctly then I would have loved the case, great material and design, just not made correctly. I wish I had read the reviews before I bought this because all of the other reviews stated that this would happen and I didn't take the time to read the reviews. So unless they fix the issue, don't order this case for your I pad mini .
The carrying bag is too tight to get the lap top in and out of, I have a mac book pro and I've only put the lap top in it twice because its too hard to get it back out. I wouldn't recommend anyone buy this for their macbook pro, not very practical unless you want it for just protecting it, but its not very handy because of how long it takes to pull the lap top back out .
Piece of junk didn't work and the place I took my phone to see if it was something I did asked me where I got it and I told them amazon and they said send it back its defected, 1 out of 10 are from amazon .
WHY did I waste my time and energy? I am not saying this due to the horrific ending (however much I hated it) But more along the lines of what I believe YA represents. In YA novels, there is usually a common ending to series and that is hope of some sort. No, it doesn't have to be in rose colored glasses, but it is why many of us choose to escape from our daily lives to immerse ourselves in theirs. This took the first two books that I loved, and destroyed the whole series for me. I truly believe that Veronica wanted to KILL her YA novel career by this move. I would never invest my time an energy in another book if she ever writes one. I didn't find this edgy, creative, or noble. I found it weak and disappointing. It has been made very obvious by her interviews and appearances, that she has thrived in all the negative feedback of this book. I guess her attitude justifies my exact reason of why this book is the worst I have ever read. She never really loved Tris, nor the readers that invested their time, energy & money into this story .
What is not to like about this book? I think some people build so much of their own back stories on characters that they can't except change. If things went just like the first three books and ended, I would have felt EXTREMELY unsastisfied. Book four was a slower read yes, but it adapted the characters beautifully and I appreciated figuring them out just that more.I have to admit I found this book sinister & sexy. *spoiler* Even with knowing Sebastian being an ultimate villain, I loved his scenes, his wit, his sexiness in a villian kind of way. Yes his incest lust is sick, but what a villian Sandra created here! I loved it.  I also loved the &#34;possessed&#34; Jace. Not in the bound to sebastian kind of way, but the part where he could let his inabitions run free & not be so tormented with himself all the time. The bone chandelier chapter & The club scene in Prague? Kill yourself sexy, hot & down right my most favorite chapter in all five books.My only negative was the end of the series. Now we get to be tortured with this fire in Jace that might hurt Clary. Sexual tension drug out a little longer. I am sure all that frustration will lead to an explosive passion that will burn down my favorite scene in the club at Prague. I loved this book, favorite of the series and can't wait for book 6 to knock us off our feet. Make it sultry & sexy Cassandra .
I loved the variety of recipes in this book. However, the recipes I've tried don't taste very good. Bland and flavorless. I am celiac & have amazing recipes I do in the crock as most recipes can be modified to be GF. The only thing that can't be modified easily are desserts in the crock, so im not sure how they taste in this book .
Chicken of the sea is great, but read the fine print here! I thought I was getting the normal size cans but these are tiny little baby cans! Of course my fault for not reading, but don't make my mistake & assume you are getting normalsize cans .
awesome texture for even the gluten eating eaters in the household. Has a doughy and creamy texture to it. Don't let the grittiness of the batter fool you. I like to really mix this well in my kitchen aide and I have added a variety of different items to the batter. Jalepeno, corn, green chills, the sky is the limit. Awesome product .
There isn't a smell in the world like that of Hempz original. I could lick it up it smells so good. Glad to have found this for such a reasonable price on amazon .
This is a great product for those picky little eaters in your life. When my daughter started drinking juice, I started mixing this with it so she never knew the difference. I can always feel good that she is getting enough veggies and fruits daily. I tried to drink this myself to be healthier and I personally couldn't get it down. The texture and look just made me gag it. I'm sure if I continued to push myself I could get it down. So, I give 4 stars that this is kid approved and my daughter has never noticed she's drinking her veggies .
Yes I am another fan of this product. I only wish I would have had this for my first child. The reason I LOVE this product is it saved my 2 month old from being hospitalized from RSV. I truly believe that if I didn't have this product he would have been hospitalized. Let me explain why, that little bulb you get at the hospital is great for, well, not much. This sucker is controlled by your own suction & it gets deep in there (REALLY deep). You will be amazed at what you can get out. And it's a fact that newborns don't breathe out their mouths, so you can imagine how important & what a lifesaver this product is for a baby that has clogged airpasseges.As some have mentioned, I can see how you might be &#34;sucking&#34; in whatever virus your child has. As for me, I would get any virus possible if it meant I was helping out my baby. That said, even with the dreaded RSV my baby had, I had to suck him out every 10-15 min for a week straight & I never got his virus. If your on the fence, don't think twice & buy this product .
I am flabbergasted by all these rave reviews on this product. I take the time to write honest reviews for products I buy on amazon as I rely upon them myself for products. This pet container came to me with a broken piece on lid. That however is not why I am writing a bad review. Regardless of my defective item, the alignment of lid to container has gaps within the entire back! NOTHING about this container is or can be sealed shut. Stating that this keeps bugs or anything out for that matter is false advertising. If you want to use this container for something that has wheels and you don't mind holes for air or whatever to get in, then this might be for you. Otherwise, save your money and time and go for something else. I wish I would have listened to the other two bad reviews so I didn't have to waste my time in returning now .
I went with Christopher because well frankly his competitor was scary looking. Christopher here isn't scary looking in the slightest, & he has an adorable story book with him that my daughter loves. Definitely a great yearly tradition with the kids to start & my daughter is still asking me when Christopher is coming back .
**UPDATE**I tried the product and it tasted wonderful. I personally didn't have any reactions to gluten either. Great buyI have missed my famous green enchilada casserole since being diagnosed with celiac disease. All the canned green enchilada sauce contains wheat. I was so excited that amazon carries this as this was mentioned being GF and the ingredients support it. Being delivered today, So I will update on taste & if indeed GF .
These were terrible. Lightweight & wouldn't hold my stockings at all. If you slightly bump one it topples over. No go .
Being a celiac it can be so frustrating to have an on the go bar that actually doesn't taste like cardboard. Boy do these fit the bill! I am not even a fan of dark chocolate and these are heavenly! They have a good amount of protein and satisfy that chocolate craving. These are a must buy, and so glad that Amazon carries them because I have a hard time finding these in Utah .
Just like the picture, the wallet is adorable. Upon receiving however it is poorly made inside. Zipper was already stuck for coin purse and wouldn't slide. Also hard to open & flimsy material & quality in the interior. Also looks like not allot could fit into it. I can't verify that however as I returned it due to the other issues .
**UPDATE**- once I opened the box of these crackers I love, they were all broken. Every box was in pieces. Unless you are making crusts out of these, this simply won't do. Can't return food on amazon so buyer beware that you might get pieces. These are a great graham unbroken however if you read belowI've tried all the GF grahams out there and these are by far the best. Don't waste your time with the others. As these aren't as crunchy and identical to the gluten version, they have a very similiar taste & I actually really like the texture. I'd compare it to a shortbread cookie. They are wonderful when you get your chocolate and marshmallow on there but equally as good all on their little own. Great deal here on amazon as I pay $5 a box in the stores .
The kettle takes the cake as my favorite flavor of these. I like them much better compared to some of the other popcorn brands out there. The texture is hearty and it has a great natural flavor of popcorn. Kettle has that perfect salty & sweet too. It doesn't hurt the waistline like a normal bag of potato chips either. Having them GF is also an added bonus .
Being a celiac & having to eat GF, I was sad when I found out I could no longer have campbell's cream soups for ease in cooking anymore. Boy was I excited when I found these. The flavor is amazing & tastes SO much better than the canned processed crap I was feeding my family before. Theses are heaven sent, and everyone should invest in a case whether you eat GF or not. Taste  for yourself the difference. I can promise you won't go back .
As I have wrote a review for the cream of mushroom in these soups, I had to write for the cream of chicken as well! Being a celiac & having to eat GF, I was sad when I found out I could no longer have campbell's cream soups for ease in cooking anymore. Boy was I excited when I found these. The flavor is amazing & tastes SO much better than the canned processed crap I was feeding my family before. Theses are heaven sent, and everyone should invest in a case whether you eat GF or not. Taste for yourself the difference. I can promise you won't go backMy only complaint is that the cost of these soups have increased on amazon dramatically even with subscribe and save option .
I can't speak for the benefits of using this formula because my son refused to drink it. He is 7 weeks old & breastfed and supplemented. First off, the smell of this is absolutely unbearable. I tried several times for him to drink it & the poor thing gave the most awful face and actually started gagging! It doesn't matter how much something works if your child can't even drink it. By the smell alone, I don't blame him! I feel bad for babies that drink this tasting so awful. I have used enfamil newborn and he loved the taste of that & have now switched to gerber good start gentle ease to supplement & he also likes that taste. Hope this review can help some in knowing to buy a small size to see if your child can even get it down .
I was super hopeful to like these as a celiac, but they fell way short for me. The texture of the turkey pepperoni is so greasy & slimy it's unedible. The cheese spread is tasteless. The only good thing about it was the nuts & crackers. Way too expensive for a tiny bag of nuts & crackers. I also though the nutritional content left much to be desired. Even in a bind, these are a no go for me .
These actually look really great on, and seem like they can fit most faces. They are also nice & sturdy not flimsy like some designer frames. Why I didn't give 5 stars was that the cloth was missing with frames (amazon immediately corrected the problem however). Also, the frames are a little wide so they are slipping off my face. That can be corrected at an eyeglass store though. Overall a great purchase at a great price & backed up by Amazon's amazing customer service you can't go wrong .
I love these gummy bears & minus a few nasty flavors it has a great variety. Like one person mentioned there was a powdwery substance on my bears & they weren't very fresh. You cannot return these once purchased, so buyer beware. I purchased the 5lb bag .
As several reviewers have mentioned, this pump leaks. I so wanted to love it as it fit more in my budget than the medela. I've chalked up the problem to mainly not fitting the breast correctly. I have tried several other pumps & never experienced this problem, so that assumption does leave me a little stumped to be honest. As mama's know, our liquid gold is precious, and it was down right maddening to use this pump and have ounces spill out the suction cups all over me & not in the bottle. As far as cleaning, it's annoying but just about as bad as most double pumps are. Pumping is a time consuming process in general, but this pump made for more work, less ease, & worry that things were working properly. I gave two stars & not one, based on the fact that I am a big fan of avent's bottles, so that is absolutely the only positive about this pump for me .
Since this was so inexpensive I rated it 4 stars. It does it's purpose & I love the string attachment as my canon rebel lens cover didn't provide that neat feature. The reason as to why I lost it in the first place! Keep in mind that this is cheap & a cheap material with jagged edges. The string was also a pain in the behind to thread through hole (I had to take a knife to make hole bigger). Like I said though the price is excellent shipped right to your door .
Who wouldn't love the taste of creamy white chocolate with tiny little candy can pieces. These things are absolutely divine. Expensive buying them &#34;off&#34; season here, but I forgot to stock up in the stores .
This doesn't spin very well when you get items in & on it. Also, if you have a munchkin wipe warmer it does NOT fit on top nor will spin because of the cord. Wish I would have gotten something different .
The original version of these are fabulous, these oxi booster on these ones are a hoax. I see no difference with using the oxi, and actually see LESS effectiveness with the color catcher. Save your money and use the original .
These were gorgeous glasses just not flattering on my face. They made me look like bug eyes with such large lenses. For that reason, I unfortunately had to return. They are beautiful however and shipping was awesome fulfilled by amazon .
These were gorgeous glasses & I'm sure would look great on some people but not many. I generally can pull off any kind of frame & these simply weren't flattering. I suggest trying these on at nordstrom's or a sunglasses shop before purchasing. Great deal if they work for your face though .
Yes I know this is a &#34;diet&#34; version of nugo's bars. However I found it to be awful. There is absolutely no taste of peanut in this bar & the texture was sub par. I guess if you want low sugar & are like me who has to eat GF & want a bar to fill on the go then this might be for you. However if you don't mind a little more sugar & even more protein, go for the chocolate mint. It truly is divine .
I will start with the positive & say that these glasses are not as cheap as I thought they would be. They are a pretty decent hard plastic. My complaint is that these were so much bigger in person than they showed online. For some that might fit your style perfectly, but these just looked laughable on me .
I never get dandruff, ever! However this product creates dandruff on me. Total waste of time and money, hate it .
I own several & I do mean several pairs of true religions. I am somewhat of a Jean connoisseur! I recently had a baby, so thought a nice pair of higher wasted jeans could do me some good. I have a small frame & long legs and these jeans definitely did not sit high at all on me. The croch area was also hanging & I generally never have that problem in designer jeans. Then there is the fabric, It's stiff & uncomfortable. It reminded me of the type of fabric on knock off jeans, cheap & uncomfortable. Based on the other reviews, I'm assuming these are more comfortable once washed. The material however is very different than any other pair of true religion jeans I've owned. I'm also not a fan of the tacky insigna on the back of the newer TR jeans. These will be a return for me .
I thought this would be cute and classy like some other reviewers have described, but that wasn't the case for me. If you have large breasts at all, beware of the dreaded side boob. It is also extremely low cut in the back. Material sheen as well .
I have ordered a total of three tops from Patty now and 2 have been a dissapointment. This was one of them. The color of this top is not gray but a light purple. It was also so unflattering! I should also note that im thin with a smaller frame. Hugs around waist showing the dreaded muffin top and then poofs out above. So it excentuates muffin top and then makes you look pregnant. It also has a large gap on arm opening that's hard to see on this picture. That large opening is why you need the bandea underneath. Material came wrinkly also I should note. I definitely would not recommend .
Sorry folks there isn't anything &#34;soft&#34; or angelic about this toilet paper. I am still trying to get rid of the case I bought of this stuff. It was a killer deal but kills down below if you know what I mean. It also breaks at the exact moment when you need it to be strong. Definitely opting for a different brand next time .
This bed is perfect for travel. It will fit in your large suitcase & isn't overly heavy. Had its own little canvas carry bag & is super easy to set up. Used it for my four year old on a recent trip to Florida & she loved her own pink & purple bed. I will note that I added a couple thicker blankets underneath her because there is zero padding. It serves it's purpose though & a great travel or sleep over bed for kids .
This is my second purchase from Pati & this top was a big disappointment. In picture, it shows that the black cami underneath the lace top is covering all of skin. Beware that this is not the case. I'm average height, and the cami underneath came right above my belly button. You can imagine how cheap and tacky that looks seeing half the skin on your stomach through the lace. A tip if you purchase this is to plan on using your own longer black cami or tankSecond issue I had with this top is the length (as another reviewer also noted). The length provided in measurements on here would only be achieved if the shirt was really stretched. It has cinched sides which make it shorter than these measurements state. I also found it odd that the front of the shirt is noticeably longer than the back. that might not bother some, but I think it should be noted for consumers.The only positive of this shirt for me, is that the lace is a soft stretchy material which makes it unique. Considering the cami is useless and it's just a lace overlay, this price is too high. Shipping is also much faster than the allotted time they give. I have received both Pati items I've ordered at different times in a week and nicely packaged .
This jacket is super cute & pretty true to size except the arms! I don't even have long arms and it came well above my wrist. Adult size but kid length arms. Too bad, because it is super cute .
Great price especially shipped straight to my door. This isn't a large cookie cutter it fits more in the small category. That's perfect however for what I need it for & it's a good quality .
While I'm a fan of pampers diapers, I am not a fan of the wipes. Where you could use one huggins wipe, you need 3 of these. They are soft, but they just don't grip the mess very well .
This was a flattering skirt as you can fold over to cover those not so nice areas on behind. I was pleasantly surprised .
Ssshhh....don't tell anyone it's not real & they will never know. Great ring at a great price. Mine did not come with the gift box however, just a ring in a little plastic bag .
Ok I must first start out by saying that I had heard of the Mortal Instrument series but never got around to reading them. On a lonely bored night, we rented in from the red and my husband and I were both really pleasantly surprised. Having seeing Beautiful Creatures that also geared toward YA, we weren't expecting much from this but maybe a laugh or two for a $1.25. We were immediately drawn into the characters of this film, and the storyline. Sure there were some iffy parts, and I didn't have the book to compare it too, but having said that we both loved it. This movie inspired me to start reading the series and I am just about to start book 3. I truly hope that they make the next sequel even that much better. I'm a fan now .
Maybe my son has an extremely short upper torso but these didn't fit at all! Even ajusted to smallest possible they won't fit nor stay up. They do however fit my 31 year old husband if that tells you anything! Cheaply made clasps to boot, and I hardly think they could hold up for more than a couple wears .
I really like this wallet. I ordered several other Kate Spade's that were simply too small but this one fit the bill finally! I carry quite a bit of cards and cash in my wallet. This is a TIGHT fit with all my items but still zips fine but tight. I hope it will stretch out a tad with use. It sometimes likes to get stuck if you don't position the coin zip wallet just right. Once you figure out how to do that it's great. Good purchase .
Absolutely love these Gucci's. I suggest trying them on in a store before you purchase to make sure they fit your particular face. Fit mine perfect but not so much on my friend. This was a great purchase at a great price. I was nervous these might be fakes, but what I can tell they are the real deal .
This wallet is really beautiful and unique. Why I had to rate it only 3 stars is due to its functionality. There are 12 credit card slots and they are SO small that you can't even get your credit cards in. After the battle of prying them in, you can bet that trying to remove them is even that much more difficult. Also when I managed to squeeze 8 cards in the wallet it already wouldn't snap. The dollar bill slot also doesn't let the bill stay flat, you would need to fold all your bills. Bottom line is, unless you carry a few credit cards & ID & you don't mind it being difficult to remove & get in, maybe this could work for you. Personally, I don't know how this wallet would work for anyone. It's a shame too, because it truly is beautiful to look at & I love Kate Spade .
I received this package 3 days later than promised from this seller with prime so beware if you are using these for a party like I was. Not only did they arrive late, which was no purpose to me as party had passed, but the packaging says made in a shared facility with wheat, peanuts, etc. So for you celiacs like me, stay away. Incant vouch for taste as I couldn't try one due to that .
This product tasted burnt and there wasn't even a HINT of sea salt at all. I was truly disappointed and confused by all the positive reviews .
I have thoroughly enjoyed LUVS as a value brand that does the job well. This is baby #2 that I'm using these diapers on. All has been going well until the new looking diapers and box came along and everything is different! Leaks that I never had before I am getting ALL the time now. Insult to injury, these &#34;new&#34; diapers are causing terrible rashes in diaper area. Varying from mild to extreme. He never had those issues with the old LUVS. Now I have a full box I can't even use.PLEASE go back to your old formula that actually did a great job and worked! Sad that I might have to be a customer to switch away from LUVS .
This jacket looks very different in picture than in person. It is adorned in tacky HUGE gold buttons, a couple even scratched. It's itchy and tacky looking overall. I ordered it from the great reviews, but I definitely don't agree with them now that I have this in person. Please also note that the sapphire color is much brighter than what is pictured here .
This jacket is just adorable. Like another reviewer noted however, the sleeves are extremely short. If you have really long arms it wouldn't work. It also has a puff around the bottom which I love, but others might not love as much. The color, design, and that bow though can't be beat .
This fits just as describe being slouchy in back. The material is soft and beautiful, not what I was expecting for this price. Shipped from over seas so it takes a minute, but came faster than expected. I ordered a couple more in different colors I liked it so much .
I LOVE the look of these, so dainty & delicate! I wore them ONCE for a short period of time & the stitching is coming undone & the thumb hole is completely stretched out. I have small hands even. Too bad the quality didn't match the cuteness on this one .
These pants feel like sand paper. They literally hurt just putting them on and off so I can't imagine actually wearing them all day. The color is brighter than pictured and a burgundy. They just look terribly cheap like maybe Rue21 clothes or worse .
These are really cute pants and flattering on. The material isn't the most comfortable so beware, and product does run a tad large. I'm normally a small or extra small and the small fit me a little large but still doable. I love the fact that they are a tad above the ankle and nice and bright for spring .
It has a unique sexy look to it, but it is SO short. I am 5'6&#34; and thin and this didn't even cover my butt. I had to return because of that .
Be careful when replacing a battery. Becasue it sitll did not work. So that was a waste of my money .
Didn't do nothing, no station, no stations, and still no stations. Just continued buffing over, over and over. Ended deleting .
The material is not strong enough for a person with true items in there bag. I had to return because it looked cheap and would not hold nothing .
I love it because I can retract and place in my purse and not have cords all over the place .
they are so so cute. i gave them as gifts. so i haven't actually use it. but the people i gave to seem happy .
An amazing true story of perseverence and strength of character. A lesson for many out there who could learn from it and not use their past and upbringing as an excuse. We all have something within ourselves to do better - if you really want it bad enough you can do it. You can triumph against all odds .
I can barely remember the story, if there really was one.  Sorry, this book did not appeal to me at all .
Nice little story but it did carry on and on. There was nothing in the story to make me keep turning pages .
Not sure if the entire book downloaded.  If indeed it did the few pages made available were a waste of time .
Reading the preview it appeared to be nothing but an advertisment to draw you into buying further books on the subject .
I found the book extremely interesting and thought provoking. One would have to read it a second or third time to remember and piece together all the information from different chapters which did not follow on .
Screen time-sometimes disappears, and the time the printer is printing blurry Ribbon is not rotating.By changing this item if you wish .
Its ok. Not bad, but not amazing either. The case is niceWish the keyboard had a battery meter so I knew if I had to charge it before class or not, so I just charge it every single day.Some of the keys you have to press extra hard to get what you want to display.And one day while taking notes I pressed the delete key and let go.....and it kept deleting and almost deleted all of my notes I had taken for that days lecture. I don't know if that was a glitch from the NOOK or the keyboard.Overall, its nice to have, but not top of the line either. Just wish it had a battery display, and the keys were more responsive/sensitive.I give it a 4 .
They have a great sound, heavy and light. A lot of tracks are great. I have no dislikes. Buy this. it's their last album .
The Odd Thomas series is fantastic; I haven't read one yet that I didn't like .
This CD is very peaceful and the waves sound natural.  We have used this to help us fall asleep for the past three years and were happy to find it available on Amazon since we could not find it in the store where we used to buy it.J. L. G .
bought as a gift...............my sister loved it! great book for anyone who loves to travel not only the usa, but the world .
love this coffee!  although i don't drink it, my sisters are great fans of it.  i have brought this many times and it is always delvered promptly .
Shipped from China to USA faster than the listed date. Arrived new, & well packaged. Decent quality not plastic but metal. The magnification is really good. Got to be kind of close to what your viewing (aprox. 1-2 centimeters) but not any problem for my use. Overall Satisfied .
Some of the scenes are a little off but Hollywood did not ride the boats so you can't expect them to  look actual but it was good for a movie .
I received the set and when I started to play the first disk, &#34;raiders of the lost ark&#34; it rattled and would not play. I ordered a separate single &#34;Raiders of the lost ark&#34; when it came it froze up after 20 minutes. I am really disappointed. The return policy is so complicated it is useless for old people .
The set came on time, wrapped beautifully, really a nice set, but one third of the way through &#34;Big Jim McLain&#34; the movie skipped, jumped tore and then froze up. I have no idea how to replace just the one movie as the other five are fine .
The tail aleron could not be inserted as the groove was upside down. The item came on time and is just what I orderd. I contacted the vendor but I have not recieved a reply .
I looked for this song for a long time I finally found it on Amazon.com and downloaded it with no problem .
I must have hit the wrong button as I did not want a kit I wanted the model, The rest of the models are good except the Grumman F6F .
This is a very good series, to bad Selleck isn't going to make more. I entire cast were very good .
I was really weary about buying this product. I have all old model t.v' s that use coax cables. I definitely will not have to by a new t.v since the ones I got still work pretty good .
This app is very interesting. I love playing kung  fu Scrat. Kids will love this app. It is very easy to follow. I can't wait to level up more to play the other games .
couldn't do better for the money worked as advertised and was of good quality. compared to other products three times the price .
i liked this book because i am deffintly not a  chinese cook but the author has made it seem easy by her choice of ingrediantsand  using common cooking tools did  i mention the taste really good to .
This book honestly took me forever to read.The beginning is long and horrible but by the time I got to the end I couldn't put it down and I was in tears .
It has good graphics but is mostly for little kids but make sure they don't buy the cash. It could have more goals to .
This dress fits me great and I look amazing in it. Everyone loves it on me. Only thing is I have to wear my nude color bra under it and make sure I don't bend over to far or everyone will see lol .
This has good graphics. It has a good story line to. I couldn't play this for hours but it helps with my boredom .
i don't lije this because its mostly for old ugly people lol. also only doing this so theyll shut up .
I love how they fit and feel but they are too thin. I went out and brought black panties just to put under them and you can still see the out line. I have yet to try a thong with them but I wish the fabric was thicker so I didn't have to worry about bending over .
This keeps my cousin who is 6 and  I very entertained when we are bored. I love it.  They give you pet points to so you don't have to buy them .
Although I have no desire to hike the AT, I have the utmost respect for anyone who does.  Wally gives an excellent account of his experience.  I had a hard time putting this book down.  Highly recommended .
They were extremely comfortable, they will definitely become pj pants in the near future.HOWEVER I bought these to use as costume pants for a Kim Possible Cosplay and the picture is not how they turned out. If I weren't in such desperate need of cargo pants I would have sent them back.So All I have to say is update your picture because instead of going down to the ankle they went up to the knee and when you sat down they went like not a full inch but a mini inch upwards so these pants are kneel length for anyone else who are attempting to buy.HOWEVER they are extremely comfortable I felt like I was wearing pajamas to the convention. however their sizes aren't the best like I'm a 20 I will admit that but to get that size I had to buy the "18-22" size which means I had to pay money to get it altered. *wasn't too expensive but still, the worst part was that it was baggy along the crotch line which for some people is hard to alter.All in all shorter then expected, comfy, and sizing sucks .
not much to say but the service was great, and the tester was just what i wanted. It is ease to use too.Thank-You .
Muito boa.O sabor &eacute; excelente, a rapidez com que recebi tamb&eacute;m foi muito importante.Gosto deste produto por ele no conter Lactose nem Glutem e isso &eacute; fundamental para minha dieta .
Gostei deste produto por&eacute;m esperava mais.Muito pr&aacute;tico e f&aacute;cil de armazenar. por&eacute;m como comprei pela internet e no v&iacute; o material com que &eacute; feita.A rapidez com que chegou tamb&eacute;m foi muito boa .
I didn't see the stones in the case. Besides that I like the feel of it. I also like that it's in two separate pieces .
Well for starters it was fast shipping. Good quality. Came with headphones. But, English needed every thing was in Spanish and you can't change the language settings .
I liked it. It was very easy to install but, it really doesn't stick around the edges. The spot for the camera didn't exactly line up. But still good .
This is probably the most amazing book i have ever read. The plot line is terrific, each character has a distinct personality about them, and Dan Wells finds ways to surprise you at every turn.Can't wait for the sequel .
Can't believe I found this for my daughter for Christmas!!  She had this on her list and I looked on Amazon.  I bought it right away and it arrived so fast!!  Thank you so much for yet another amazing Amazon experience .
I cannot believe the price for this movie!!  I love &#34;Lightening Deals&#34;!!  Top rated movies and items for rediculously low prices!!  Yay me!!  Now, back to shopping I go .
I had to buy this game again because my sonwore the last one out!!  He had this on his giftlist for Christmas.  I wasn't surprised to see thatit was now listed in the Platinum Hits.His favorite games are the WWE but this onehas always topped his list.We did get him the WWE 13, as well.  But aclassic is always a classic .
Billy Crystal is hysterical in this movie.  I bought it for my son for Christmas because he loves &#34;The Rock&#34;.  And this movie is so good.  You can't beat the prices here at Amazon, either.  A nice stocking stuffer, I think!!  Thank you .
I can't believe the price I was able to get this movie for!!  My kids saw this movie and loved it.  When I saw it for the lightening deal on Amazon, I couldn't pass it up.  Another excellent deal!!  Amazon saved my Christmas .
Great movie, excellent price....  I love shopping at Amazon.com!!  This is a Christmas present for my son.  He saw this movie at the theater with a friend and hasn't stopped talking about it.  Now, with the help of &#34;Lightening Deals&#34;, I was able to afford to buy it for Christmas!!  Thank you .
They are very comfortable and cute.  Well made and worththe money.  My daughter loved getting them for Christmas!!Even if you're not a Jersey Shore fan, the slippers are a hit .
This case has very fine details.My daughter plays the guitar so this was a mustfor a stocking stuffer.  I'm glad we chose this one.The picture can't do it justice because of the finelining that is on the guitar and around it.The case fits perfectly and was a perfect matchfor her .
The zipper has already torn away from the inside of the purse.  The cloth is frayed around the zipper.  I cannot find an address to return the item.  Am I suppose to keep an item that has become defective within a few weeks of wearing it .
Do not buy this, just 2 months later, stopped working completely =(. At the beginning it was wonderful, then it did not worked. I wasted my money. Now I have lift it up manually .
I bought this for my daughter, she is about to be 8 yrs old in 5 months and weights 56 lbs. I bought her the medium size and it fit her perfectly. The only thing is that it does not comes with the feather as in the picture. Besides that the price is fair .
The pads smells really good, but It didn't stay in place. By the end of the day I lost one, it fell off (embarrassing). I would never buy this product again .
I connected to my desktop and then to my TV and It work immediately. The only problem I found was that the image was kind of red when any white screen appears in any website. For example, I was in the Google page and I could see some red coloring in the screen image, but I went to Facebook or other website with other colors the image appears clear and nice. I don't know what it is .
Just purchased this tent for a camping trip to the Outer Banks of NC.  We arrived Friday afternoon and set the tent up for the first time with no problems.  The weather for Friday night was supposed to have thunder storms with high winds.  When we set up the tent we filled garbage bags with sand and placed them on the floor around the inside of the tent.  We also used sand bags for the ropes outside the tent.  The weather man was right about the bad weather.  At 8:30 a huge nasty thunder storm with heavy rain, lightning and 50+ winds.  We left the tent and slept in the jeep based on the park ranger telling us to seek shelter in our vehicles.  The storm lasted about 3 hours.  When it was all over we looked out and the tent was still standing and in really good shape.  We checked inside to find the floor only had a few puddles.  We were very pleased at how well the tent with stood the weather.  I would recommend this tent for durability and ease of set up!  Gotta love a Coleman Tent .
Fits nicely on my keyboard and shows up well. Shipping was super fast! Only downpart is that some of the blue on the stickers has started to chip off, so I can't see all the characters .
It is very soft and has beautiful curls. Colour is excatly like in the picture. The cap is with adjustable straps. I love it! It doesn't loose much strands when you brush it carefully either .
First off: This turns hot pink on your lips!I didn't like that it turned pink, even though it is kind of cool. it also slides a bit on my lips, and easily leaves that awkward ring around my lips &#62;.&#60; It smells very good though, and the packaging is very cute! The tube is a little low quality, as the bottom separated with the lipstick, and the lipstick got kind of stuck in the cap .
not as quick to register appropriate temperature as had hoped..HAD THERMOMETERS HALF THE PRICE WITH THE SAME RESULTS so the cost alone isn't warranted .
Great price!  There were easy to follow labels and directions.  I had no trouble installing this on my ipad.  Very pleased .
Ot came just as showen in the picture and very durable. Didn't break when i dropped my phone and protect it very good.  I recommend this to anyone that has this phone and it is very cute .
Great product i use it everyday to keep my hair from fizzing out.  My hair is very think and this conditioner is very light weight.  It never leaves my hair heavy and does not create a build up .
The camera is one of the smallest board cameras and has a larger field of view than some. This may be a plus or minus depending if your useing it for overall security or idenification purposes.  The low light actually is not as good as the larger styles due to the small lens size.  Audio was acceptible and small on the board mount makes it stable with less waffle that some of the others.  Good for what it is but if your looking for "Night Vision" this is not built for that, an infred style is what is needed.  With a small amount of light in the area your wanting to target this works and can be put in a tighter location .
The DVR and it's functions are great. Easy setup with a two function selector and on screen display.  Decent quality video and audio as was expected from the specifications.The down side was that it came with a foreign power supply.  I recieved an email from Dozens Media prior to arrival that warned this may be the case and to notify them and they would send the correct one. Contacting them i was told since it had been purchase through Amazon they couldn't help with the matter. Amazon had me return that unit and replaced it with one with the same power supply.  Amazon did offer a 20% discount on the item or full refund. As the unit was what I wanted I took the discount.Hoping it continues to work .
THIS BELONGS IN A BUBBLE GUM MACHINE NOT ON AMAZON. WORST PURCHASE I HAVE MADE IN MY ENTIRE LIFE. AWFUL .
These very expensive Pens have very very poor Ink Quality. I don't like these pens, not even a little bit .
I like to be clean and smell nice. I don't like to smell like I am from the city of brotherly love .
so I don't know what the receiver has to say but since I haven't heard different, I say it was liked a lot. I order from overseas and might again. Thanks for the fast delivery .
Hello,since I just ordered this item as a b-day gift and the receiver didn't say any different I would like to assure you that we did get what we expected. Might order again from you.Kind regards .
This game is amazing. The game play is easy for even people that do not play many kindle games. I'm a mother of and think this is a great quick stress reliever .
Great arrows, best deal I could find. Locally I could only find these sold individually for 7.50 an arrow with no field tips .
This series has been very entertaining so far and will continue to buy the future volumes can't wait for the next volume to come out .
High School of the Dead is one of my favorite animes out there great buy you won't regret buying this if your a fan of anything zombie related .
This game still hasn't lost what makes it great it was fun back then and it is still fun now. This game is tons of fun and I would recommend it even to a new player .
The factory thermostat when out on my jeep after 110K miles and 6 years.  The factory replacement cost $180 and would take about 3 or 4 hours to install (in my driveway).  No thanks.  This little guy slips right into the radiator hose, with a 50cent hose clamp to hold it in place and now my jeeps temp is perfect. I saved about $160 and 3 hours.I love this car but man is it expensive to maintain .
I loved this book even though it broke my heart.So much good information. I wish everyone would read it no later than today .
Every time yu weigh on it you have to bend over and reset it.  It does not return to the setting where you set it.It was a waste of money.  Would never recommend it to anyone .
It did not hold my interest, I'm not sure why but I am hooked on Candy Crush, maybe thats why .
These jeans are beautiful.  The fabric is soft and the color dark enough to be smart or casual.  I am a size 27 in 7 For all Mankind and these were true to size.  I am 5.9 and these were more than long enough so shorter woman would need to have them taken up.  They are a snug fit but not to the point where they are skin tight.  Love these .

I remember wearing these as a child. loved them then love them now. I can't believe how it's exactly the same as they were back then .
if you want a lunch bag to keep your kids food warm, this is not the bag you want. I put warm water in a jar and it went cold after 3 hours. but other than that, it's cute comfy .
I didn't know other people needed stuff like this. I thought I was crazy when I couldn't go to public bathrooms nor could could I send my children to public bathrooms... too bad for me right? til I found this thing lol .
I bought this item for my daughter because she is a huge Adventure Time fan, and her favorite person is Marceline. It arrived in good condition. But the extra head that had came with her was too small to put on, and we when tried to, both of her legs came off. We glued them back on but found this very disappointing. The rest was okay, she looks great on her stand with her guitar, but the head still doesn't fit on .
It is a great sword for the money. Seems to be good quality, I haven't cut anything yet.The main problem is that the holes in the handle are not cut out .
I choose these because they claimed to be multicoated. I already have many uncoated diopters.  I don't even think that these are coated at all. These are very nice otherwise, but disappointing to me .
I have read almost all of Patricia Cornwells' books. They always keep you guessing,making you think you have it all figured out til almost the end of the book when you find out you really were not close to the right ending. Love her books .
Very good product so far.  Easy to use and clean. Bakes as well as regular oven. Heats up quicker and cools down quicker. Have not noticed much difference in cook times with the things I have baked so far.  Would recommend as 2nd oven or for baking smaller amounts of food.  Shipped and arrived promptly .
Product is crsp. Cannot death phone with cover on. .. hole isn't right. And trying to remove case broke the case and scratched my phone .
This item, while super cute, doesn't fit snug enough to hold the phone inside the case.I'm so disappointed! Can I return it .
Great fit, very secure, does not obstruct any buttons. Offers decent protection against everyday bumps and bruises. Smooth leather-esk feel is nice to the touch and allows my tablet to easily slide in and out of pockets. Obvious choice for a simple nexus 7 case. I got the white color, and after about 6 months of everyday use, the white has picked up some color from here and there, mostly blue jean stain from sticking out of my back pocket while walking around .
The book kept me constantly intrigued. I did not want to put it down  I kept wanting to know  what was going to happen next .
everthing is there ,,,this book is amazin bc since i got it and can do things for myself and that is making feel better also i have save a lot of money repairing  myself ...before any detail like changes brake pads i usecto go to the local mecanic no ican do it for myself .
i have drooped my phone several time and nothing happened ,,that is the better part about this silicon cover also easyto take out a i love it .
id like to purchase another one but blackberry doesn't support a lot of app..but it ok it works very fast .
it look like a real mirrow and the better thing is when you turn your screen then evething look like if no mirrow there !  i really love it!1 .
At first breast feeding is not easy, these shells really help me to have a successful experience. They are easy to use and clean, and really protect sore nipples .
Love it, coffee tastes so pure. Really easy to use, a disadvantage could be you can't make just one cup .
Everything was perfect with this product, we used it to make milkshakes and smoothies everyday during 8 months, but a few days ago while using it, it started to sound funny and then it wouldn't spin, so it broke. I don't think it can be fixed since it looks like it burned. This is why I don't recommend this product .
Good quality product, very stable, I felt safe using it. Bath time was a blast all the time, made my baby very happy until he was 5 months old and he wouldn't fit in it, I wish it was a little wider.  I would recommend this product .
For those who are very sure they want to use cloth diapers, I think this is a very good option. They are high quality cute diapers, I like the leg adjusting system. I have been using them for 4  months, my baby is 5 months now, but they were a little big for him at first. I use liners and pre soak them, I think this is why I have never have to deal with stains. I would definitely recommend this product .
I don't actually use these pads, they are not easy to warm. I wish they wouldn't get cold so fast .
They could have just put the cryptex in a freezer, waited until the vinegar froze, and sawed it, removed the paper carefully and that's it! was I the only one who thought about this? Seriously it didn't let me read comfortably, I was all the time like &#34;Why they don't just freeze it? It's just liquid inside!!&#34;Another thing, if Sir Leigh Teabing told Silas to enter Chateau Villete and take the cryptex, why did he hit knock him down when Silas did as he was bid? It is just illogical and unjustified in the book .
Bought two one for friend 60 birthday and one for myself. Was supposed to be CD & Bonus DVD and only got the CD and no Bonus DVD .
A BEAUTIFUL BOOK.  iNTERESTING PICTURES AND GREAT PROSE. i HAD READ HER BOOKS BEFORE AND WAS AFRAIID I WOULD JUST BE GETTING REPEAT INFO.  NOT SO .
A girl's best friend! Great body massaging toy! It's a stress reliever, awesome gear shifts, cute and light weight. Not as quiet as I hoped because I live in a dorm, but still worth the buzz .
I Am an African American female with a relaxer and already I am seeing more new growth than usual! Not to mention its thicker and softer!! My nails also grow thicker and faster so I know they are healthy .
I am 5'4&#34; and thick, so I was worried that the normal 1 size fits most wouldn't fit right. But it looks amazing on me! Other than some of the gaps around my waist from a bigger chest and smaller tummy (still looks sexy because you can see my curves under the stocking) It fits awesome, looks great, it's not itchy, and the material isn't cheap so it doesn't rip or tear around the feet .
These glasses didn't even fit in the case they came with! After about a week they started to dismember and the lenses keep coming out .
It is not a very good quality but it gets the job done. I just wish that it was more sturdy .
I still have it and it does the job. I have had no problems with it thus far and its been almost a year .
I absolutely love this comforter. It's not cheaply made and is so soft .
This shampoo cleaned both my dogs very well and they smell great. The smell is not too overpowering but just enough .
I originally saw the theatrical version of the film first and absolutely loved it, then I saw the director's cut. I fell in love with the first version I saw, but the director's cut was terrible. It had a lot of useless scenes that did not need to be in the film, like Lily's singing. Many reviews say that the theatrical version doesn't make sense, but the plot is super easy to follow and in my opinion a lot better. The director's cut just adds 20 extra minutes of scenes that aren't needed to follow the plot. Whatever version of Legend you like, it is pure magic and a perfect fantasy movie. Legend Ultimate Edition is awesome, it has both the director's cut and the theatrical version. I love everything about the DVD set, it's a must have if you love Legend .
The low &#34;Rating&#34; for this transaction is due to the fact that I paid for a new book but was sent a used book. The item was not damaged in shipping but had been already used. I'm reluctant to place further orders for books, music or videos after this experience .
I debated between one and two stars. I desided to be kind. This balaclava has three drawbacks... First it is way too tight when trying to put on over the head. My head is not that big. Trying to pull this balaclava on with gloves is more difficult than it should be. Second, the neck is poorly designed. It's not only too tight but it's also too long. It has to be rolled up to be comfortable making it even tighter. If it's going to be this long, it should be designed to fit the chest and shoulders better. Last and most important the part that fits over the nose is dangerously tight. Once again, I do not have a large nose. In fact it could be considered a bit on the small size. This balaclava is so tight on the nose it mashes the nose into the face. This pressure restricts blood circulation in the nose. In extreme and prolonged cold this would lead to frostbite of the nose. The material if fine. Some of the best but because of the poor overall design I gave it two stars. There is no excuse for not understanding something as simple as, if the blood has a hard time flowing, the flesh freezes. The OR gorilla mask is a much safer choice .
Cord did not work after one week. Seems to be a short in the connector to the tablet. Cheaply made .
The suction part holds firm to the the glass. The &#34;arms &#34; which hold the tablet lock fairly well.  Ther is a problem with one of the holdin arms interfering with the volume control. If you try to flip the arm section around to attach it to the tablet, the arm section and the sucker section will not stay together. The problem is how the arms section connect to the sucker part of the device. There are four small holes in the back of the arm section that match up with the connection points on the suction part. These points slide to hold but just barely and not at all if the arm section is attached in a way they do not cover the volume controls.  If the point slide is in a direction where the slide is catching and your vehicle hits the slightest bump in the road the two parts disconnect sending your tablet crashing down onto the dash or in my case in a Jeep, onto the gear shift knob. Thus a broken tablet screen. If there was a way to give this device no stars I would have. Why go to the trouble of making what could be a fine device and poorly designing one of the most important parts. If you plan on useing this device make sure your car is not moving and your volume is set before you put your tablet into the mount. One poorly designed section makes this device not just worthless but very costly when it breaks your tablet .
I did not order or receive this item. I am now going over my bank statements to see if I was charged for it. If was charged, that means Amozon's security has been compromised .
The quality of the shorts cannot be beat. It took sometime to receive them however well worth the wait. I bought a size 36 and they fit as a 36 should. However I should have bought a 34 to return them would be to costly. I have cought another two pair 34 and they fit perfect. The shorts sure do provide a lot of complements for others. Would very hightly recommend .
This ring was far from the ring that was on the picture, no were near. I don'r even believe that it was the same ring. I keep it for whatever reason, however will never wear it. Wast of money on this one. I ordered another that should be comming in within the next few days, hoping I have better luck with that one. Anyone want to buy a ring I have one for sale .
Well, it is the end of the working day for me and I cannot wait to get home and take off what they call boxers. It has felt like I  have had something up my ass all day. That said: They may be O.K. for evening wear but I cannot see myself wearing them again for the whole day. They are a little short cut in the front, so it is impairative that you take care of yourself there, however they do look good and even make you feel good, just not to work in all day. So. O.K. for evening wear but not recommended for day wear .
Received in just a few days after, therefor delivery was excellent. The belt I thought would be a little better quatily for &#34;Tommy Hilfiger&#34; product. That said it is not a bad product and looks very good with both dress pants and jeans. I normaly wear a 33 to 34 in waist size and thererfore ordered a 36. It fits in the 2nd hole and still looks reasonable, but I may of been better off with a 38. For the value is is not a bad belt and would recommond .
I bought the (S) and should have ordered the (m) they are a little tight, not unwearable however a little tight. I tried the order the (m) in white and for some reason they would not deliver them to Canada or my area anyway. The (S) I guess they do just not the (m) intresting. The quality seem good. Worth the buy .
Delivery was fast. I am not sure as what all the hipe was about ont he other reviews. They are what they are Boxer Brief, nothing real special about them. That said: They are comfortable soft and feel good, they do streatch a little by the end of the day so I think I may have been better off with a small instead for that reason, however then they may have been to tight for the bigging of the day. If you like this kind of brief buy it but as said before nothing special about them .
Wow, received them in record time. When wearing the boxers you feel like you have none on. They are very light weight and fit to a tee, not to mention the inhanment they give. I bought both the white and the black. Will buy more. Gentelmen do your self a favour and try a pair. Garantee you will love them.... Now on the other hand the cost of the boxers with shipping and handling came to approxamently $73.83 and then was stuck with a bill for customs of $18.00 for a total of $91.83, do the math $45.92 a pair .
Received them yesterday, delivered as promised to the day. The quality of theis shorts cannot be beat not to mention the comfort and they look great. ordered a size 34 and they fit to size. Hightly recommended .
I ordered this short sleeve in a XXL and it is very tight and unfort I cannot wear it. To sernd back it will cost to much, therefor I will keep it and hope to fit into it someday. However it is made of great quality and other then the size not fitting it would have look great. hightly recommened for someone with a six pack, not there yet. That said: please note the XXL is indeed maybe a med for someone without the six pack. However it was made to fix tight. Overall good quality for the price. Well I am happy to add that the shirt now fits. It looks good and has a very slim fit to it. So I guess all along it was the product by me. withsome waight loss and exercise you can make it look good and this shirt helps.... I have washed it a number of time and still lokks great .
Delivered as promised. Very good quality it seem. I have not had a chance to wash it yet. I ordered the XXL and the t-shirt fits good and it very slimming .
The delivery of this item was increadable, less then 3 days to door step. Did not like the fact that I was unaware to pay 24.00 for custom. I thought that may be included in the shipping. However, I bought this t-shirt and another one from the same company at teh sametime, (The Lees CVT07) Men's casual longe sleev botton point round neck, both in XXL as per the comments that it fits tight. Well this one came and I could fit a horse in it while the other one was better in size, this tell us that the sizing of the XXL are competly different for all styles. I decided that since I was going to use them for rags (thin one at that) that I try to wash them and did so in HOT water and through in the dryer. Believe it or not but they came out fitting like a glove. The reason I gave this review a 2 star was due to the material being paper thin and almost completly see through. One the other hand what do you want for $19.00. This company needs to hire a quality control person to assure that the close are all made the same. If they do have a quality control person he or she should be fired. I believe that my shopping days with TheLees is OVER .
&#34;See through, See through, See through. Did I mention see through. The white pair are completly see through. I would not walk around in public fear of being arrested and I mean that. The delivery was good, package arrived prior to delivery date. The lounge pants are well made and very light, you almost feel like you are wearing nothing they are comfortable but can only be warn in the privicy of your home and then depending on who may be there. What ticks me is that the vendor should state or show in the pic that they are this way, there are many that would like this look and did or do not buy because it did not show see through, however, others who do not want this look get a little screwed. That being said: Because they are so comfortable I will keep them and even go so far as to say that I will purchase another pair in Black and hope that they are not as see through, if they are I give up. &#34;The reason for the two star is the vendor's not honest with the pic... In white anyway .
Well, I will not start by saying that my package is to large for the boxers and that I have my wife, girlfriend, partner tell me which one's to put on each morning and then sit there and watch me put them on and then can't stop rubbing my package until well you know, Please people this is not a porn review.I bough three pairs Yellow, black and light blue, I usualy wear a 32 in pants and a medium in boxers underwear, they fix perfect to size. The cotton is good quality and they seem to wash well and no problems with the dryer. The waist band is of good size and does not roll down, a perfect fit in the legs and no riding and the same from the back. Overall, I would recommend then to any one who wants comfort good looking sexy pair of boxers. As one reviewer said: they have good support for the package, as woman have bras to left and support there breasts, this does the same for the package &#34;Well said&#34; and sooooo true. I just bough the other three colours .
The delivery was as stated. However I normaly wear a 32 to 33 in Jeans. I bought the 33-34 and they were very tight has to send them back. In this case I think that a 36 may have fit. The legs are very skinny. That being said. They were well made and had that heavy durable meterial. bottom up fly. I gave them a 4 out of 5 because they did not fit. I wish they did becase as said they were a realy nice pair of jeans. If you hve really skinny legs they will look great on you. They just were not made for me. I would recommond the jeans to all. By the way, To send them back was easy and refunded within a week. Thank you Amazon .
I like my Epson printer and would not use any other ink for it.  I have owned an Epson for the past 10 years .
To peaple in USA, It works fine, and kind of slim.  But the smartcover not always work. It worthes 10 dollar&#12290;&#23545;&#20110;&#20013;&#22269;&#35266;&#20247;&#65292;&#35841;&#33457;&#21407;&#20215;&#20080;&#20102;&#20877;&#36716;&#36816;&#22238;&#21435;&#23601;&#26159;2b&#12290;&#21704;&#21704;&#21704;&#21704;&#21704;&#12290 .
we love the wind up clock.  why is not sold in stores????  ITS A GREAT PRODUCT  TO BE SOLD  WE ARE GOING TO TELL OUR FREINDS .
no fault in phone but charger fail it...charger take alot of time to charge....i love the phone but hate the charger .
i choose a four star because i am happy with my teeth. i would recommend the cosmetic teeth to any one with bad teeth that they won't to cover up .
so this may have been the best gift i've given to anyone this Christmas! i bought it for my youngest niece and the second she opened it you couldn't get it away from her it was adorable! it really is the world's most huggable teddy bear lol .
I'm pretty neutral on this product. I haven't taken it for too long yet, but I have no adverse affects. I picked this product because it has a much higher amount of EPA and DHA and is rated as a clean supplement by an independent lab .
This product sucks ass when I received it doesn't work and have tryed and tryed to exchange it but whirlpool does not and will not stand behind there products .
I looked at powerscore and only powerscore when I was studying for the LSAT. For the logic games I was stuck hitting around a 19 or 20 and no matter what I did I could not seem to be able to get perfect on games. I bought this book to help me and it got me to 22-23 on games. I will not criticize powerscore because they helped me a lot but I will just say that some of the things I picked up in this book really made me question some of powerscore's methods. Overall, I really think this book + powerscore is the way to go. You need to find what works for you on some things and should not blindly follow powerscore without question. I cannot rate this book on its ability to get you a high score on logic games on its own, as I used this book to supplement powerscore, but I really don't see why it couldn't .
This item was not at all what i expected, it did absolutely nothing for my skin.After what i read about it i expected to see some change like maybe smoother skin with more even skin tone.But honestly noticed nothing .
It was not at all what I expected, it was cheaply made in my opinion, the reviews compared it to Conair ( I think I spelled that wrong) which couldn't be further from the truth.  I got no instructions, the battery cover wouldn't stay on. But they were great about giving me a refund. I hate giving bad reviews, but sometimes it's necessary. Thank you .
Doesn't fit properly,flimsy.I thought this a little more sturdy.If the phone was dropped I can't see how this would protect it .
This was not a bad phone,it just wasn't what I wanted.It would drop calls,loose internet service.Was very slow at downloading .
When first reviewing this phone I was looking in the wrong column and gave it a bad review.Thought I better explain this in case it showed up.I definitely recommend this phone I am very happy with it.It downloads fast,no dropped calls.Very easy to learn how to use.I've had no computer experience so its not always easy to learn how to use some of these phones.I was led to believe that if I ordered the phone by a certain time I would get it the next day,I ordered the phone on time but did not receive it the next day I contacted Amazon and all they said was sorry this happens sometimes.I can't say I was happy with that answer .
Don't fall for their free trial offer, this does not exist. They will charge your account $97.88. When you call to dispute this no one will answer the phone number provided. I called and canceled my order within 10 days like they said and they still charged me, so i called and canceled again hoping they will get the message. Also filed dispute with my bank concerning this.And will call BBB .
After what i read about argireline i expected more then what i got, especially in an item that claimed to have 10% argireline. I read it smoothed out fine lines making wrinkles less noticeable, more even skin tone, a miracle cream.But once again saw no results. Would not recommend.I noticed my skin actually felt dry i had to use another moisturizer on top of this one .
A fun game for adults to play with their adult friends. I would not play the game with my adult children and would be uncomfortable playing the game with the &#34;grandparents&#34;, but I guess that's part of the fun watching them squirm. (not the adult kids. I still have a very hard time even considering playing with them .
These are definitely eye catching boots. Wife has Fryes and Uggs and these have a little more room. Very comfortable. If you like what you see in pictures you will love them in person. No doubt a guilty pleasure .
I bought this for my 8 yr old. Big learning curve to fly. I've successfully flown it at times without running into furniture, windows, people... nothing broken and no blood drawn. It is fun to fly once I got the hang of it. Flying time is a little short as the charge only lasts for approximately 5 minutes. The time it takes to recharge provides an opportunity to pickup the things I've knocked over when flying .
I was expecting the camo to be part of the pattern in the material. It's screen printed on the fabric which gives the set a cheap Wal*Mart look and feel. The scarf and hat were at the limit of being adequately sized for my 8 year old, but the gloves are toddler sized. I would not recommend for a child over 6, and if given the choice again I would not purchase .
Wonderful cook book! Everything is vegan, and had recipes to make everything from scratch including nut milks and " cheese". Must have for any vegan . Many ingredients require a trip to the local health good store like whole foods or sprouts or market street but all well worth it. Once you have your pantry staples your free sailing from there . This will help you make wholesome, whole food meals that are not just delicious but packed with useful nutrients and calories to feel good about. It even had a section on infant and child nutrition and making your own baby food ! Buy this book .
The fit was good. The material was excellent.I bought this based on the reviews.If soft, doesn't itch and fits great .
I have had them on for 2 weeks now. No issues whatsoever. The packing in which these arrived was extremely sturdy and I had no issues with shipping either. Does exactly what is says. Excellent build quality. I have been through 3 high powered car washes and not a drop has entered the housing of the leds.Price: GoodBuild and Quality: ExcellentAppearance: ExcellentHighly receommended .
Good built quality. And the light is white.... Does not give a bluish tinge like a lot of led'sRecommended product .
They aren't waterproof but all you need is some silicon sealant and your good. I used these on my F-150 on the front grill. The housing in which the leds are placed is not very sturdy and dont be suprised if you notice a few cracks near the screws.They are extremely bright and for the price they are worth it. Overall if I had to buy these again I would .
Not exactly a mood setter in the car. I'm probably gonna go back to the incadesent bulbs in my car.Looks good for the number plate lights.Build quality is good, works well.The color is not white. It does have a blue tinge to it. Probably 6500k. I was looking for something close to 4000k .
Kept you turning pages wondering what would happen next.So many turns of events you couldn't predict what was going to happen .
I have to buy a new cord every so often because they don't hold up for more than 6 months, even if you're very careful with them.  This one started to fail after just one week.  I have heard that the non-Apple cords do this, but was very disappointed to see this happen with an Apple cord .
I would never get another one. You have to touch the screen real hard for it to work. I do not like it .
couldn't get a better pair of sunglasses, and quality is through the roof,service was sensational and i will always and forever recommenced customers to these guys .
I was totally connected to the characters. I couldn't figure out the  culprit until the very end. I was very unhappy when Ellen was killed off. This is an awesome story. I totally enjoyed it .
Loved Psimon and Steve. The pace was fast. I truly could not put it down. It was such an original plot. This was a great novel .
Don't waist your money on these. It's not worth it. I bought it thinking it was a great deal. And ended up regretting it. The speaker sucks. My only lasted like 3 days and it stop working. It's just not worth the money .
Worst product I have ever bought!! I mean not only did the package came ripped, but the insole is way to wide my feat won't fit in the shoe!! I advise if your planing on buying it, to think twice before you do .
It's not the best product out there but I can guaranty that you get a good deal out of it. I have been using them and they are great. The only issue I had was that the blush brush came with the top loosen. However, that was easily fiches with some glue. Great deal over all .
Did it work? Yes it did enhance my butt size but it is too expensive I wouldn't advise you to buy it. There are provably other products out there with the same formula and ingredients for less money .
I tried on three different rail systems and would not tighten on any of them, sending back. I wasted my time and money .
I have no problem with the cream....it is in the small print of the add that I do have a problem  It comes across as 1.7oz size and in the very small print of the add it is the sample size that is actually for sale.  It does say on the product that I receive that 'it is not for resale' .
I work outdoors in the Summer and Winter and this watch really holds up well! it goes whitewater rafting with me almost everyday in the summer time and I have never had it fog up on the inside! and it holds up well in the zero temps during my winter snowmobile tours! I have only replaced the battery once and it lasted a little over 2 years! The first thing that will go bad on the watch is the wristband but as you can see I am pretty hard on it .
This guard is great! It fit perfectly in my 2006 Kia Sorento! It does not rattle and it keeps my medium sized lab mix in the cargo .
The photos of these salt and pepper shakers do not do the actual shakers justice absolutely beautiful they made a wonderful gift for my boyfriends grandmother who just loves bird houses .
I love this Funster! This is just what I needed for a concert I was going to, it was just the right size for the amount of things I wanted to bring. it has a coin pouch, three credit card slots, and a pocket under the coin and credit card places. This is perfect if you don't carry much. And not to mention it is adorable! Kavu never dissapoints me .
I bought these in November as a Christmas gift to my Grandmothers when I received them I fell in love, they are in fact super cute. But when I looked at them more I noticed the stem that holds the glass wick had been put inside of the glass jar, so therefore when it was shipped to me the wics of course got broken into pieces. When I told the company they said they would gladly send me more wicks....I have yet to see those wicks and it is now March. So if you order these be careful your wicks maybe broken and you probably won't get another .
This case is pretty much what I was looking for. It is very cute and it protects my Windows Surface just fine, the only thing I don't like is that the case covers up the camera for the most part and I pretty much have to take it out of the case to take photos, but other than that very cute .
I can't find the new 1.3.0. Up date but I really need it by the way great game I love it it is packed with all kinds of stuff but plz  tell me how I update it .
This book is filled with practical tips for those women who are swamped with information at diagnosis; it allows women to navigate through the world of hospitals and medical speak and find quick, helpful and relevant information. Written from the perspective of someone who has experienced breast cancer as a young woman, the author draws on the knowledge of health care professionals and other women diagnosed, rather than promoting her own opinion. You won't be disappointed with this book. Sue, a breast cancer nurse .
Normally I would not buy this product because I am in college. Since it was Christmas I thought I would reward myself, and I just gone through Accutane (I have had serve acne) so I thought this product would be perfect. Its not. My Clarisonic stopped working after 2 months. Save yourself some cash, do not buy this product off of here .
My second one, first one lasted over 6 years (broke the band), never had to change the battery. Kept precise time .
I didn't notice that this was for an old operating system when I bought it. I would not even load. Very disappointed .
These jeans fit me very well. It's hard for me to find &#34;short&#34; jeans that are not binding. At 68 my figure is not what it used to be. I have 3 other pair .
The splitter is saving me time and trouble. I can't cut or break pills at all on my own. I would recommend this product to others .
I purchased this pendant for my Granddaughters 16th Birthday. While I haven't seen it, she liked it very much. No complaints from her, I'm very happy .
I was pleased to find a base unit that is land line based. No batteries, and no one moves it. The handsets work for various areas of the house, get lost, etc. but the base stays put. Good quality, reasonable price .
Got it for my sister can't complain it's sharp and looks good. Doesn't look or feel like it will break soon .
It's a pretty sharp knife out of the package, strong and durable won't be breaking it anytime soon love it .
Richard Saul makes people aware who didn't knew, that there can be a million factors in a childs life to diagnose it with ADHD when in fact something else is going on. Good to read this book, though i disagree his favourin bipolar in some cases. I am more in favour of the vision of Peter Breggin, Alen Frances, Robert Withacker and David Healy when it comes to labels like ADHD and Borderline.Good Luck .
Disapointing, to receive an ereader that feeke like oldschool after my other ereader. i didn't realise it wasnt touch screen..making notes is frustrating slow .
The watch is a very classy men's watch...very accurate time/date.  It is stylish & sleek yet casual.. you can dress up with it - I wore with a suit,  or dress down with it, jeans and a t-shirt..  plus its substantal weight to it let's you know it's made from strong quality materials - Stainless steel, scratch resistance face and the heavy canvas band.  It fits my style to a T.  would rec. it to any one that isn't really into &#34;shiny&#34; watches or all metal watches looking for an every day kinda watch. more substance than flash .
This book was great! It was so detailed, but no so much so that children couldn't follow it. My son loved it so much .
This book made no sense. It left in a ridiculous place. It didn't even make sense from the beginning. Not good .
This game is fun. It takes good internet conection to load but it never freezes up. It takes a long time for some of the upgrades to load but its still possible to play without adding money .
This app is hilarious!! The cards are adorable and they make my day!! I get on here to send one person a card and end up looking at all of them and sending like 5 of them. Some of them have pretty mild humor but it don't bother me none! If I could rate it a billion stars I would .
This game is so addicting. I play it whenever I get a free minute. I have no complaints.It is so hard to find good games for free. This one is right on the money .
I ordered this swimwear, then read the reviews... bad idea. This stuff is so small. I'm a medium and size 5 pants. I got a medium. I even email the seller and asked if it was going to be a problem. .. they said no but email them back if it is. So I get it and guess what... so small. Soooooo small. I'm having to get an xl. But I email the company and they said that they would send another free of charge. And they should focus more on the clothing and not the model because I didn't see the file gold beads on the top when I ordered itOverall all right .
I purchased this one because I have been wanting this color. I bought from Kingdom Warehouse. It looked completely different from my other Lime Crime lipsticks. The shape of the tube was similar, but a noticeable difference. The color was definitely different from the other tubes. And the logos were already faded and didn't match up right.... The box was also in terrible shape. Very disappointed .
First the picture makes these lashes look more dense then they actually are. They are super thin and too long I don't know how they appear natural . You can tell your wearing falsies right away. They are easy to apply and wear they're comfortable. But I wouldnt order again I'm sticking to my Ardells .
I used to apply my foundation with my fingers but I've totally stopped.I love this brush !! Its super soft and a dupe for sigmas flattop ! And all the times ive washed it its never shedded definately a must have leaves such a flawless finish .
I have all of Johanna Lindsey books began the  collection over 20 years ago and i still go back and read all her books over and over again. I have tried to read other books but they are not the same as Johanna's books  which keep me comming back to read .
fits very well and never have to worry about it breaking or taking it off when i shower  or go swimming .
I love ramen.  When I lived in japan I tried to make my own but it never came out right.  This book was great.  This book only comes with one ramen recipe so if you were hoping for a whole book of ramen I'm sorry .
I ordered yellow gloves and what I got was neon gloves I can't use them in uniform.  Great gloves but not what I wanted .
But the taste was not so good and it was not as hot as it was advertised.  But I bought it mostly for the name .
It is not the real swarowski, it changed colour exactly in three daysits not genuine swarovski!!!!!!!!!! not recomended it is not real .
It is not the real swarowski....... it changed colour exactly in three days!!!  not recomended......!!!It is not the real swarowski, it changed colour exactly in three days .
Size is not quite fit to me!!its hard to buy clothes by internet,Ok, anyway....its not a reclamation!!thanks .
My papers came early so that was good the cotton candy taste exactly as that should ,they burn a little fast but taste so good and these are the best papers to smoke moist "tobaccos etc. ;") You do not have to keep on lighting them. I rate a 5because they're always on time,and what you see is what you get. Thank.You .
I Absolutely love my pro vac, Ok so it doesn't come with a pump be prepared to get 1, but if you know what your doing OR NOT Its 2014GOOGLE IT there's So many Full Instruction VIDEOS on the ProVac etc Mine came in Excellent condition &I've gotten some of the best tasting concentrates ever making gorgeous product, thank you I Totally recommend The Pro Vac 3Or 5Gal .
Love my new wrapping paper, can't wait to actually use it!! So cute with a red bow for Christmas!! Sender was fast .
Well built stock fit my mini 14 really well but a little bulky feeling when holding it up maybe just not use to it compared to original stock .
Fits like a glove I should've ordered a half a size bigger bc I like my wiggle room BUT my insoles fit perfectly in them so it's mos def true to size so no complaints there!! And I look so freaking GANGSTA I'm so FRESH with these shoes I teach Zumba/HipHop so you know comfortability and style they both come hand in hand for me so BOI I love my shoes .
OMfreaking G!! These shears are the bomb digity I don't ever write reviews but this one definitely deserves 5 stars bc they for one super sharp and they are long that's how I like it so get them!!!! If you're interested!!! Hahaha .
I never received the comforter I had already paid for, UPS reported that it had been delivered to my front porch on the date scheduled. UPS was very rude and dismissive that it was their fault and stated it was my issue to bring up with Egyptian Cotton Factory Outlet.  The customer service agent Syed was very prompt to respond to me, and after I waited for a few respective days and checking with my neighbors to see if it showed up, ECFO sent me a replacement comforter immediately. I am really appreciative that they remedied the issue and took care of it even though obviously it was not there fault at all. Thank you .
Awesome game loved it I shared to 234 people I can't wait to share the wonderful game  it's totally amazing did I say amazing .
I like this frother a lot. It's light and strong, the foam is perfect, and I like that is long enough to reach the bottom of a larger glass. I use it to make my frappe with a lot of ice, it's just a perfect drink for the summer. For the winter I make it with a hot milk. For the price, you are getting an awesome product. I gave it 4 stars only because I used to own a big proffessional frother (and also much more expensive). No complaints so far .
These were time-consuming to install, especially with no instructions included with the fenders. I was able to search for and download instructions for a similar fender set, and used those as a guide. I don't like how bulky the plastic clips are that attach to the fenders and hold the stays in place. My tires are knobby mountain bike tires, and the outer knobby tread rubs against the clips. I had to bend the stays so that they bow outward to get more clearance. This applies abnormal pressure to the clips, which can only be bad in terms of durability. I particularly believe this to be true because the instructions I found, which were for a similar fender made by Axiom, say the stays need to attach at right angles to the fenders. The clips also do not appear very durable, and I expect them to wear out or break soon. Especially the front clips, which are designed to release should debris clog the fenders, risking harm to the rider. However, I suppose the price was reasonable enough, and so far they have kept me from getting a skunk stripe up my back or mud flung in my face when riding in inclement weather .
This light is right enough, but not as great as some of the reviews I've read make it out to be .
This book is really amazing! Historically correct, well written, and simply beautiful. Can't wait to read the rest. God bless .
Exactly what I expected. Looks great. You could not go wrong with getting this product. I highly recommend this product .
I'm an old jazz man who has always had a thing for the seductive cooings of a sultry chanteuse.I hadn't listened to my Julie London albums since the advent of the C.D.After decades I heard Julie's rendition of "Cry Me a River" and the spark was rekindled.The three disc set has all of the great standards sung in her inimitable style.By her own admission she has but a "thimble" of a voice but man,what that thimble can do.Carefully enunciated lyrics,that breathless,hot phrasing,and that torrid delivery still get me.Forty five well chosen tunes and you'll love everyone of them.An easy five star rating .
I'm an old gym rat and was recently injured in a car crash. I began using the triple band handles with several colored tubes. I noticed that the soreness associated with  machine and free weight routines was greatly diminished. I kept at it and really started seeing results . Presently I have a multitude of cables ranging from 20lbs. to 70lbs.With ingenuity I can duplicate all gym exercises for a great total body workout. I take a  pair of 25lb.dumbells with my bag of  cables and I'm set for a great workout.This is the second year that I'm employing this system and have ordered new cables . I still use the gym to keep the muscles confused and I find that I can hit all the muscle fibers by using this system . These cables can take a beating and maintain their power and elasticity . I can't do without them and this old body responds without the pain and muscle damage from my old gym routine. I highly recommend the product. The staff is great and cooperative and delivery is in a few days .
This is one of the best necklaces I have ever owned at first I was a little nervous about the size, as it is bigger than what I would normally wear but this is a Stunning piece and does not appear too gaudy while wearing it. I can't go out in this without someone complementing me on it. It is holding up amazingly and still looks as lovely as the day I got it. Simply an amazing gift I will always treasure it .
loads of fun to be had with this bad boy. Would be 5 stars but the screws that came with it were just the wrong size so had to expand the holes a size before they could be threaded in once that was done it worked like a charm, and had him begging in no time .
Pandora is amazing! This is one of my favorite songs ever how can you not completely love this song anytime it comes on .
My 1 1/2 year old son LOVES the Elmo and would frequently lay down, hug Elmo and say Awwwwww.  He received Elmo for Christmas, opened it Christmas night and by New Years he didn't work well anymore.  He didn't play with it very often, it never was dropped or fell and he never rough housed with it.  Both of Elmo's arms hyper-extend at the elbows making it so he doesn't hug anymore and his mouth doesn't work half the time.  Also sometimes when he presses his belly he doesn't speak at all.  He played with him total about 1 1/2 hours.  Pretty horrible for such an expensive toy .
I bought this dispenser and 12 refills for it last year. My acne was moderate but I still wanted to take care of the few I had. I absolutely love the dispenser so easy and convenient, unfortunately my face has suffered dramatically. I had to discontinue use because my face has been horribly broken out since I started using it. Would not recommend for all skin types at all. I am so disappointed I may have to go to a dermatologist because of what this has done to my face, I've never been to one before and have had no need too. Three stars because I love the dispenser, it will never receive the other two from me because the cleanser ruined my face. Still upset I guess .
Fun so far easy to win too enjoying myself recommend downloading this if you like casino games that are free .
Just needed something cheap and easy to transfer small job files between computerized machines and they worked perfect. Can't complain about anything when they did what we expected them to do .
Totally not what I expected. My son has almost all the schleich animals and love those! This castle isn't sturdy, seems so cheaply made, not like the other schleich items we've purchased. The door that lowers and rises, I have to keep adjusting it. Very disappointed, not worth the money .
This is not at all what I imagined, I know the price wasn't much but it wasn't a well made product. The color of the petals are pretty but the rest of it doesn't look like an orchid. Orchids are pretty, the petals are flat, the center yellow part of it looks awkward because of how weirdly long it is. I bought it to wear for my wedding, but chose not to because I just don't feel comfortable wearing it. I know it's a fake flower, but I just hoped for it be more realistic .
This bicycle is a great addition to my garden bed. It fits a shallow medium size pot and I switch out different annuals throughout the season. It is light in color so it goes perfect on my red mulch bc you can actually see it. Would not recommend placing this item against similar colors bc it will be hard to see .
These masks were a huge hit at my son's dino theme bday party. They are great for goodie bags for the kids .
This was great for the first few months, but then began to not charge and therefore does not work anymore .
This spray is amazing! I got a sample size of the perfume, along with a few other Victoria's Secret scents for Christmas last year and finally got to this sample and instantly fell in love when I sprayed it. Ordered it right away and what a great deal. $20 for a big bottle of body mist. A small bottle of the perfume is $50, and I can't tell the difference between the body mist and the perfume, so saving $30 is the way I'm looking at it .
Looks very nice in my bathroom, but the water pressure is not the best. It's good for a tight budget bathroom renovation. I've bought 2 of them for each bathroom in my condo .
Bought this for my son's bday party and it was impossible to hang so the kids could pull the strings. I didn't have much candy in the box either, so it should have held up the weight that was in it. Poor quality .
I like these bc they are wooden and have a great look and are sturdy for the fridge. My son gets a lot of use out of these. The only thing I didn't like was when they arrived one of the wooden letters was poorly sanded and the edges were jagged and caused it to be unusable, so I had to throw it away. Other than that, great product .
This razor is great I love that you don't need no shaving cream that saves money and time! But it just wasn't for me it didn't get the job done how I wanted it. It did leave my legs smooth it was light weight easy to use but not for me .
We've used these pillows for years.  This was our third set of these pillows, and when these wear out we'll buy more. The pillows provide great support for the neck whether sleeping on our sides or our backs.  They help with neck alignment, an ongoing problem following a whip lash injury I suffered about 40 years ago.  My husband uses the regular size pillow, and I use the travel size pillow.  We're very happy with the quality and the extended life of these pillows.  I'm not sure either of us could sleep on a different pillow now .
It's regretful that it doesn't produce the sound, but it has an excellent light! Great for any Doctor Who fan .
This buttwad product is not even made anymore an its still 600 bucks??? Where did that come from? Im deeply dissapointed i can't pick up a discontinued product dead for a year now for dirt cheap .
'Exciting' is not the word, it's tantamount to being darn right terrifying.. utterly compelling. This is a thriller comparable only to (a modern day) 'Jack the Ripper'! It's intense 'heart-in-the-mouth' suspense has twists and turns you'll never predict. Two complete opposites cross paths and a life threatening scenario develops into an insanely impossible situation. Spiced with subtle humour, the unexpected will captivate you as will each page intrigue you. What a book - what a film it would make .
A riveting and exciting thriller, I found difficult to put down once I started. Rose effectively delivers a suspenseful tale that will have you gripping for more from the very beginning. While I felt that at times the author either rushed through certain details or added in needless backstory, H. Raven Rose held no bars back when she describes the gruesome details of the murders and the sinister mind of a psychopathic murderer. I absolutely loved it and I look forward to more tales from H.Raven Rose .
"Light & Dark: The Awakening of the Mageknight" is a fantasy adventure fiction of a 13 year old boy, Danny Firoth, who discovers that he has powers that are of a different world. "Light & Dark" traces Danny's transition from an average student in his school to his development as a Knight of Light at a Knight's academy called the "White Rock Academy".The novel successfully draws the reader into this magical world, a place of elves and dragons and other magical creatures. Fife knows exactly what he wants in this world, what he wants of his characters and what they are to do. My favourite was the dwarf blacksmith, Sir Bartlett Firebeard who although played only a minor role. I was actually hoping to see more of him. There are other concepts that will keep you intrigued and turning through the pages to the end such as "The Navi", "Bonded" and "Drakes". I quite enjoyed this book and would recommend this to persons of any ages. I would definitely love to see Danny Firoth fully harness on his powers in the following books, should Fife develop into a series .
Book 1, Tea Party Teddy... what do I say? I was chewing through this book in no time. I love a good political read and Dianne Harman doesn't disappoint. This is politics as dirty as it can get. And like politics, this book has multiple layers and plot-lines that will keep you entertained and hanging onto the edge of your seat. And as for Teddy, he is a true politician. No, everything is not what they seem in this cleverly written political tale. Can't wait to read Book 2! Loved it .
Ms Harman successfully exploits the method of using the antagonist as a central character to drive the story in this book. I was particularly impressed with this style in Tea Party Teddy and sought out to purchase The Teddy Saga in my curiosity to see if she would  manage to invoke as much excitement as she did in the first one. Truly enough, she does not disappoint.The Dear Reverend, as he is referred to, is your typical antagonist that everyone loves to hate. But what makes him unique is his hypocritical public persona. The kind of man everyone talks secretly about but no one dares to stand up to. His despicable characterization makes him perfect to carry on the legacy of the almost equally hated Teddy Randall in the first book.The ending was certainly a surprise and the suspense was wonderfully handled through the course of the story. Alternated at clever intervals with humor, action and drama, Tea Party Teddy was a short,exciting read. Certainly recommended to those who love a doze of dry wit with dirty politics .
&#34;The Forest Portal&#34; is a time-travel fantasy of three young people- brother and sister, Cam and Collete and their friend and later Collete's love-interest, Taden.I really enjoyed this story. It is written in simple and descriptive style which makes it easy flowing and a faster read. In addition, there are loads of twists and turns that kept me turning the pages for more. There is also a little romance that had me tingling a bit. And it doesn't disappoint with a fabulous and surprising ending.The concept of how the characters travel through time is so simple and ingenious that you'd wish it was real. Overall, an extremely fun adventurous book .
Don't let the pink fool you. Superhero Princess and the Curse of the Rainbow Fairy is a novel that will take you by surprise. It is hilarious and witty with twists and turns that will have you guessing to the very end. It's a like a long dream that moves swiftly from one comedic episode to another. Yes, there is a princess, all dressed in pink and yes there is a frog prince and even a curse as well. But that's where the cliche ends. Because in Superhero princess it is the princess that does all the work, saves the prince and if he doesn't treat her well enough, there might even be a threat that she will squish him. There is even a food fight and I don't mean food fight but where food fights. Oh well, what I mean this book is not what anyone expects it to be. The style reminds me greatly of a Diary of a Wimpy Kid and it is just as funny. I loved every page .
A fantasy world and the search for a Vullen- the only cure to a Wolfinic bite.Natasha House has created a wonderful fantasy world that will have you enchanted the moment you start turning the pages. The illustrations that accompany these fantastical creatures are beautiful and enhance your imagination as to how and what they are like. The story is beautifully written and the characters well-developed.The Vullens come from a village in The Dredge Forest and are overpowered by a curse that prevents them from leaving it. But what happens when one Vullen called Deilia escapes? And what does Deilia do when she is hunted by King Nahor to cure his wife from a Wolfinic bite? "The Vullen's Curse" is entwined with mystery and suspense that will have you intrigued until the very end.I can't wait to read the next story that involves the search for a baby Wolfinic .
Ok, so I was a little hesitant picking up this book. The issue of black slaves in the early period of America is heart wrenching and to read about it always puts me into a very emotional state. So unless I trust an author to narrate his/her period piece well enough, I try and avoid it. Otherwise it annoys the hell out of me.Seeing that this was based on Nat Turner, the African American slave who led the slave rebellion, I just wasn't sure if the author would be able to deliver it to my expectations. But Cagle's Prophet took me by pleasant surprise. He's done his research and relayed a story that touched my heart. From the first very page on how black slaves were captured in their homeland and then their journey to the plantations of Virginia, caught my attention and soon I was turning the pages, eager to know what lay ahead. Nat Turner, the main character, draws you well into his world as you follow his life, and endure his abuses. The narration and the storyline is excellent and close to real.Prophet is brilliant and I certainly am looking forward to the movie .
First love at first sights has always intrigued me. So when I was offered to give an honest review in exchange for a free copy by the author, I jumped at the chance.On the face of it, I had assumed was going to be one of those cute run-of-mill historical romances. But as soon as I started reading, I was yet once more reminded why I should never make assumptions. This book took me by complete surprise, having me turn the pages consistently until I reached the very end.The story covers a love period lasting from 1533 to 2007. Now how is that even possible? Well, without giving too much away, there is paranomal and time-travel, heightening it to one great romantic adventure. Other than that, I was completely in love with the language and the culture as the author depicted it. Baker is eloquent and appropriately positions language as per the time involved.And then there is the love lorn Gian Luca who painfully searches through time for his beloved, Catarina- THE Queen Catarina de Medici of France which gives a completely new twist to the story.Love, longing, adventure- This story will enchant you through and through .
Absolutely loved it! Heart simply blew me away. The opening had me captivated and the ending left me breathless. There is certainly something exceptional about the way Kol Anderson writes and I haven't regretted picking up this book at all. Five stars all the way from me .
"Gringa- In the Cltuches of a Ruthless Drug Lord" is not your occasional sweet romance. If you're looking for one, I suggest that you put this down and find another. But if you're not averse to capture bonding, rape, vulgarity, sex and drugs, then by all means read on. "Gringa" is a smart and crude rendition of "Beauty and the Beast". It's an adult mini-series that traces the experiences of a woman who willingly barters herself in exchange for the lives of villagers to- you guessed it- a drug lord. Yes, she is a strong, feisty, foul mouthed character that stands up to an equally dominant man, which makes the story quite exciting. While I found the the drug lord to be revolting in the first instance, I began to empathise with him towards the end of the story. Rabi leaves the story at such a point where you would be keen to learn more of what would become of the relationship between 'Gringa' and the drug lord. I enjoyed reading "Gringa" and would definitely be picking up the next book in the series .
"The Footbridge" is about a young seventeen year old girl, Sally Mason, who struggles against the turmoils in her life: a drunk, alcoholic mother, an absent father, poverty, bullies at school and social discrimination. Just as she thinks there is nothing more to live for, she contemplates suicide. But not before fate throws in another twist to her life!!Everyone needs to read "The Footbridge". Yes, it holds elements of fantasy but that is minor compared to the social issues Chapman discusses in his novel. I was so rapped with the strength of this character in the midst of all the social troubles she was facing that I had not realised that the fantasy crept in at a much later part of the novel. And I didn't even mind!! But when it did, there were adventures, action, romance that had me turning the pages like a clockwork. I couldn't put the book down until I was done with it! Absolutely well-written and fluid in it's narration, Chapman delivers an excellent rendition of how a person should stand up against the social adversities in life. It had me crying the one moment, laughing the next and cheering by the end. An awesome, awesome novel .
Yes, Big Brother is back and he is now more sophisticated and more than he was in the year 1984. Big Brother no longer relies on the telescreen; he now has electronic gags. You pay him whenever you speak. When you speak without paying, the electronic gag that Big Brother put on your neck shocks you with its electroshock belt. When you speak words that Big Brother dislikes, the electronic gag starts recording you. Big Brother knows all your whereabouts because the electronic gag has a tracker. Yes, you hate the electronic gag but you can&#8217;t take it off your neck because it will explode and kill you. You are doomed to a life of misery and repression. The only way to end your misery is to topple Big Brother. But Big Brother keeps track of you with the electronic gag he put on your neck.It&#8217;s a great dystopian story which we can all relate to in these of days when the government is spying on its citizens. In Electronic Gags, the government uses a telecommunications company to do its spying on citizens and in our case our government uses web service providers and ISPs to spy on us .
Solstice is a head-spinning thriller. It seriously needs to be read when you're alone with nothing around you to interrupt you because it simply is a heck of a ride.I enjoyed this novel, unable to put it down. The twists, the turns had me turning the pages to the end. It is short but it doesn't disappoint. It's mayhem and gore written superbly and certainly not for those who do not appreciate the dark and intenseful tales. Loved it .
This is not just literary porn. There would still be a story if you take away the sex. This is a refreshing change from most erotic books by new authors, which have no storyline and are just a loose collection of steamy scenes. In Amanda, we have a determined, sly villain and in Megan we have a likeable victim who is a prude. I am waiting for more books from this author .
So what do you get when you combine erotica with mystery and suspense? A super read, that's what!."The Last Time" has a plot that keeps you entertained and sex scenes that are evenly paced to make this a sizzling read, not forgetting suspense that keeps you turning to the very last page. The sex scenes are also very tastefully written that will leave you anticipating for more. Elodie Parkes does a brilliant job at creating a quality erotica you will not regret reading .
"The Winter Girl" had me captivated from the very first page.Lily moves to a small country town only to discover that she has become the target of the local playboy.Elodie Parkes does not fail to create a spell-binding page turner that will have you steaming through scorching sex scenes or begging for more romance. I was in love with the main characters and despite Ash's womanising history, you can't help be smitten by his charms and give this hot character another chance. This is a story about love and the hurts of love. What makes it even more enticing is that it's so true to life, like a page lifted off from someone's real life. "The Winter Girl" has everything that makes it a great sexy romance read .
This book makes you realize how to be the right woman for the perfect rich guy you always dreamed of having. This book also makes you more subtle, classy and elegant but one thing is for sure no matter how perfect your physical appearance is if you don&#8217;t have the right attitude, your appearance is nothing. This book made me realize that a woman needs to adjust and change for herself in order to catch the attention of her ideal man. Women need to know what men are inclined for so that we can suit perfectly with them. I think everything is possible. You just have to do whatever it takes to get what you have always wanted. But remember though, you can only achieve it by improving yourself including your personality not just your physical looks. I want to share this book to all the women out there who wants to have a more stable and secured life .
The first line caught my eye, &#34; Men cheating on women is as old as the world itself.&#34;  And I thought this couldn't be more true, although woman do also, but let's not go there. This is for the sisters.But putting the issue of sexism aside, I think the advice is very wholesome and applicable to both genders. It is direct and to the point, without cutting corners. It's a great companion for people, especially for those who believe they are alone in dealing with this prproblem .
Elodie Parkes does it again! She gives another erotic tale of love entwined with mystery and suspense.Although this is a little shorter than her other novels, it still doesn't fail to hook its reader from the beginning to the end. The paranormal aspect is a great backdrop for a perfect menage.I loved the two male characters- Nathan and Reed. I wish I could tell you more on them but I'd end up revealing the plot. Makes you wish Ms Parkes had more to the tale and hope she will write more on them.So if you're looking for quality erotica, then I would definitely recommend this one .
I'm very particular of historical romances. I took a chance with this one. I haven't regretted it. Like the title, it certainly has that Jane Austen feel to it. It is beautifully and eloquently written which is quite pleasing.Portia, the female protagonist is a likable character in addition to her very handsome romantic interest, Phillip Salisbury. There are enough twists and turns to keep you captivated despite the short length. But don't be mistaken. It is an entire story. Highly recommended for anyone seeking a short regency romance .
Elodie Parkes writes a short seductive tale between two people who had always meant to be together.Daisy is just the ordinary girl who falls head over heels with the handsome stranger, Dhruv, who frequents the bar she works in. Unbeknownst to her, the man knows her only too well and wants her just as much.Parkes weaves an effective mysteriousness into this book, combined with sexy hot scenes that will have you begging for more. But more than that I was intrigued by the element of love between the two characters and I wish this could have been explored more in detail. Regardless, this is definitely your coffee table romance (or your subway romance, whichever you prefer), you won't regret to pick up for that 'on the go' moment. Definitely a winner. Loved it through and through. Highly recommended for all erotica lovers looking for substance .
I have always been a Cinderella fan and I had always thought that it was a tale of this poor orphan girl, a prince, a wicked stepmother and well... the famous glass slipper.I couldn't have been more wrong. I was blown away by the many different versions. Whoever put this anthology together, was brilliant! It's certainly a book I would treasure and keep for my daughter.Oh, and the illustrations are beautiful .
"I see the Devil" is about a mentally ill patient called Jeremy who attempts to commit suicide after believing that his friend Aidan is Lucifer, the Devil incarnate. Aidan helps Jeremy break out of prison and they go on a mission to bring about the apocalypse.This is truly a noir book with a paranormal twist. Not your usual genre fiction. If you're a fan of Palahniuk and other noir writers like Clevenger you might enjoy this one. Being inside Jeremy's head was a little twisted at times, and there might be a few issues I have with the plot, but it is entertaining. Be warned that it is violent with a clever, befitting use of abusive language. If you don't mind that, then you'd enjoy this mature and excellently written read .
A romance novel in the truest sense of the word. Couldn't put it down till the very end. Believable with a mix of sexy and heart.Very cute and fun romance. Enjoyed every minute of it .
I'm not too keen on dystopia and I wasn't so sure about this. But the blurb was interesting and sucked me in. I decided to gamble on it and I'm glad to say I didn't regret it at all.The writing was great and the plot was intelligent and thrilling, keeping me on the edge of my seat. Couldn't put it down until I was done .
&#34;The Black Lion&#34; is a beautiful romance erotica that had me enthralled from the very first page. I immediately fell in love with the two main characters, Melissa and Sascha and felt that they were indeed fated for each other in all that time. Beautifully written, I couldn't put it down until I finished it. Although a short read, it was well worth my time and the ending took me by complete surprise. The best dollar I have spent in a long time .
My daughter (18 mos) thinks this is just great. One of her favorite words lately is "baby," and she has fun  identifying the baby in the house & putting it in the bathtub or the cradle. The house is durable & so are the little people. I came home one day to find my dog had peed on the house. I washed the people and the house in the tub with some hot water & Clorox. I thought for sure there was no way the buttons for the different sounds would work again. After I washed it, I took out all the screws in the bottom and removed the batteries (hindsight: should've probably taken it apart first, I know), drying it as best I could. I was very surprised to find that after everything dried, all of the buttons work just fine! Some of the stickers are a little worn from being wet, but even they held up better than I expected. I definitely don't recommend washing the house like this unless you have to, but I think it says something for its durability that it survived .
this game is really freaking awesome. love how its not ti easy but its not hard either. only thing sucks is most thing charge real money .
good simple game easy to play, my ten year old has enjoyed playing spider. not a great deal of thought required,he liked the help button .
As a single woman seriously considering marriage to a particular person and having a family, and complicated, even in these Obama days, by my being African-American-identified and his not being so, I snatched up this book among others on having a family; But this one I snatched up too quickly.This book proposes that even people in heavily industrialized nations should have three children per couple. This encouragement runs both against demographic trends and against common sense about resource usage. Demographic studies show that as countries grow more democratic and as education and opportunities are extended to women, population growth diminishes, to the point of, on average, just over two children per couple. People may not love children any the less in these cases or be acting any more selfishly than people in the Middle Ages when birth rates were higher. They are simply occupied with many activities that make life exciting and worth living. Also, sanitation and the availability of clean water and vaccines have helped reduce infant mortality and so reduce the need to have four or five or more children per family to increase the likelihood that some offspring will survive to reproductive age. Urbanization has also meant less need to create "free" farm hands by means of growing fetuses.Furthermore, the spreading knowledge about how industrialized nations more rapidly deplete resources than ever, so per capita resource use continues to climb and threatens those available for one's descendants has probably had some positive effect on industrialized peoples' attitudes. These peoples are becoming increasingly aware that the higher the per capita use and the higher the "capita" or head count, the lower the likelihood that descendents will experience a good life.This book both wants to counteract the demographic tendency and hates with all its little heart the increasing knowledge about resource depletion. For its counteractive desire and its boiling hatred of scientific knowledge about resource depletion, this book depends upon a peculiar metaphysical concept that holds that, no matter how many people are on the planet or in solar system or wherever, they, driven by the "free market" will find a solution, such as ever-new kinds of resources and how to exploit them, to any problem the species can ever encounter.This faith is such a blind one, it drops the jaw. The only justification it has is the fact that Malthus's predictions did not come out as predicted. The planet is still surviving, long after it was supposed to have been ravished to nothing by overcrowded humans.Therefore, the logic goes--since Malthus's prediction was off--it must be that overcrowding will never happen and humans no matter how numerous will always prevent problems of "overcrowding" by providing ingenious, happy solutions through the ingenious Magic Hand of the free market.Magic, indeed.This hypothesis is either A) unfalisifiable, or B) proven false only when it is too late, that is when there are too many billions of us and the resources are indeed depleted without the market's having provided any last-minute salvation. Alternatively, the unfalsifiability of it rests in the fact that apologists for the theory could continue indefinitely to promise that the free market is about the solve the problem any minute now. Similarly have cults kept their following growing ever-stronger, upon occasions when the messiah was supposed to reappear, by saying the messiah is coming actually on X date.The basis for this hypothesis derives partly from some 18th-Century thinkers inspired by the showballing enthusiasm for the Scientific Revolution's promise to give us a good grip on nature. Since then, both the sciences and market innovations, whether really free-market or not, have helped usher in many conveniences. But given that many of the long-promised solutions "just around the corner," such as the cure to cancer and nuclear fusion, have yet to happen or even indicate how they will happen, there is at least as much, if not more, reason to doubt the faith in the market's ability to solve any problem humanity can ever face as to doubt that the population explosion will ever create a problem.Given merely the increasing evidence of global warming, ozone-layer depletion, and biodiversity depletion and the vast majority of scientists acknowledging these phenomena as facts and growing ever-more concerned about them, there is substantial reason to doubt the hypothesis's blind faith.It would not be within the confines of reason to follow this book's advice to add more industrialized capitas.One curious note about the book's peculiar assumptions. The book contends that parents really need not spend that much time with their children, even if there are three or more children in the family. On the one hand, the book implies that it is selfish not to have a good tussle of offspring. On the other hand, it is here appealing to a selfish tendency in industrialized cultures to want to spend less time with their kids. (Studies, astonishingly, show that people is these cultures put spending time with their kids low on their lists of pleasures, below things like exercising or eating out with friends.) So it seems we should only have kids, by this book's logic, to produce ever more many brains for the future to solve the problems that the presence of ever-more many brains (capitas) create.And--to further salve the consciences of those too busy to play with their kids--one need not worry about whether ignored kids will develop right. Genes do everything important, all on their own. Apparently, if Einstein had been left in solitary, featureless confinement in a cellar, with food passed under the door and never hearing a word spoken or seeing a thing in print, he would still have discovered general and special relativity. Curious faith, this book .
i bought 2 items last October 20th that said new on the description. im from Panama nad i had to wait 1 month practically to receive the package and find out the wheren't new as described. almost 3 moths and i still don't have my phones.Shame  on tablets distributors.Amazon team helped me out with this issue a lot. Good for you guys, keep on the great job .
The length and material on these were ok. I ended up returning these because the waist did not fit well. May not work well if you don't have a second waistline.  My waist and hips are about the same size so the waistband really cut into my skin .
Fits good, I don't have a waist so this pant does not cut in. The feel of the fabric is very soft and flows with your body well. I would buy more if the future .
kind of difficult to work with - there is no return button on the keyboard (why?),  so if you want to type in more than one line on a note it gets tricky.- you have to use the space bar.  Also the keyboard tends to pop up and block your options panel, making it impossible to use.  The look of the whole thing is kind of dated too. It could be a really neat app if done right .
Truly fantastic. Can't wait for the next chapter. One of the best games I've bought since I've had an iPhone/kindle - you won't be disappointed .
I read this book about eight months ago.  I didn't realize who had written it until I started listening to Father Whiteford's podcasts on Ancient Faith radio, and he was saying some of the things I recalled reading in the book.  This book is solid in its approach to the subject.  I had Protestants trying to preach this dodgy doctrine to me, and since I had no idea what it was at the time, realized I needed an Orthodox priest to sort it out for me.  I am now, thankfully, unconfused on the topic.  Thank you, Fr Whiteford .
I'm sure this is a great toy for some pets.  I had high hopes for it.  Unfortunately my mini daschund never took to it.  I think the toy is good but its popularity will depend on your pets personality.  For my pet, it just didn't work .
My daschund loves these little toys.  They are looking quite grungy at this point even though we try to clean them up every so often.  Has had these since she was a pup and she is now 7 mos old.  Still plays with them and they're not torn up .
Bought this as a replacement for the same toy.  My mini daschund really likes the toy but had ripped off the ears on the other one and it started to lose some of the stuffing.  So, we purchased another one.  If your pet plays more roughly they may enjoy the toy but don't expect that it will last all that long .
Item was just as described.  It's not large but a nice size and elegant looking.  It was purchased as a gift for my daughter's friend and she loved it .
i did not see it but my son in law assures me that it is great just what he wanted.delivered on time and just what he needsthank youM.W .
What a disappointed to pay some much for a DVD that will no play in South Africa!!!!!I don't know why these orders are accepted when being placed from SA .
I found this book to be interesting and hard to put down. the characters keep you involved and you feel like you are there with them. I can't wait for book 2, I already pre ordered it .
These gloves are NOT the same quality as the SAS 66518. Not the same mil thickness, rip if caught on anything, or nothing at all.very disappointed in these will never buy again .
First off, it was sent immediately. ... and when I got it it was the right part.... and since I recieved it ... I have had no problems .
Although I had to return this item, as it was too big for my pet, I loved it. Fabric was great, as was the color, style, & overall look.My pooch is a 7lb. Maltese & the jacket was just way too big for him.  I was very disappointed it didn't fit him. I would definitelyrecommend this item.  It is also very attractive .
love this item , can't wait to get the correct size--love the stripe on stripe look andthe deep pocket fitted sheet .
Eleventh Hour (FBI Series)I like the plots of Catherine. They are well developed and the suspense is really keeping one attached to the story. I do not feel time passing while reading which is a blessing I have read Coulter since ten years that is when I found a book she wrote .
Plot is weak.Th e background taken in the far east countries does not help recognize the progress of the action .
The batteries don't recharge well.  A full recharge last about 30 minutes. This is a poor product, do not buy .
The lens was not upto my expectation. The filter was good thoughOver all not satisfied at all  with it .
Great product, but not the right fit for the Minibar in my hotel, packaging box was not pretty to look at .
I found this book extremely helpful! As most of us know, the GRE does not test knowledge per se, but is set up in a certain way to trick you into failing. This book provided some basic knowledge along with many helpful tricks to identify what kind of question the GRE asked and how to &#34;crack&#34; it. It helped me get good scores on my test and I would therefore definitely recommend it .
It came sooner then expected, and I was really happy for that! This is my first tail, so I can't complain too much... But it is quite large. Thankfully, it's not the first toy I have used, so it only took a little time to be used to it. I really like it, and hope to find more items by this seller .
We have had Bodum presses for years. It's next to impossible to find parts (particularly the plungers) so I bought the Chambord. It's the same beaker size as the old one so that's a plus. If I could have found a plunger I would have kept the old one going but the Chambord is a nice upgrade and doesn't need the cork coaster .
Well, as I read in other reviews, brackets are really weak, not fix great the communicators at helmets. But about communicators, I was pending to buy another more expensive option thinking this by a quarter price could be bad and I was wrong! Until 140 km/h I can talk almost normal, I need to seal better my helmet cause the problem is the wind at ears, but the Mic don't catch the wind sound really. Good time conversation with one battery charge, more than 5 hours (with phone conversation, playing music over Bluetooth and talking to B rider). Bluetooth talking never dropped a connection, B rider sometimes happen but pressing to connect again and waiting 3 seconds, be back to conversation.Bluetooth experience was good with my cellphone GPS app, too.Want to think another way to fix it to helmet. Nothing more to say, will buy one more kit to ride talking with my friends in their motorcycles. Cannot ride with my girlfriend without this, ever, so strange to take a mute ride now. Great product, with a good price, only need better brackets or ways to fix to helmets .
It was very good, and I am not saing that bacause Freddie is my wife's father .I really mean it .
Im thrilled with this purchase! I saw the dress in a department store on clearance, it was torn and not in my size. I was happy to find the same dress when I looked on amazon! It arrived quickly and it fits perfect .
Great story line. Enjoyed the cultural backgroud. The novel's caharecters were not deep[ly developed.Recommended fro those with Italian/American backgrounds and interest in family unity .
This film was extremely moving.  It has popped into my head several times over the last few days, I can't get it out of my head.  Because I don't want ruin the nuances and details for anyone reading this, I will just write that at the end it may feel as though it is a let-down but give it one day and you will never forget it.  It was moving, powerful, provocative, terrifying, uplifting, demoralizing, and motivational all at once .
As a person who has wished for years to play guitar and have absolutely no musical background whatsoever, reading this handbook, I found that I, knowing so little music, found it difficult to follow and was lost within the first few pages, but that is understandable since I know next to nothing about music.  But a introduction inserted before the table of contents might be helpful to lay out the purpose and the authors intent of this book.  This would not be a first book for someone like myself with no knowledge of music and how to even read notes.  Tom PabinI can read and play music, but not on a guitar, but I could very easily see how someone without knowledge of music or a guitar in general would be lost and would need to start out with a much more basic lesson book prior to this one.  My husband, Tom, didn't know what the symbols were for a flat and a sharp note, so this book obviously would be for someone with more basic musical understanding.  Lucie Pabin .
I wish I had bought this sooner. We have been using q-tips and pipe cleaners and it was always such a hassel to clean our smoothie cup straws and stainless steel straws. With one pass this cleans it PERFECTLY! It is pretty long, and the wire gauge is thick so its definantly going to last. The bristles are only at the end, but don't let that deter you. The bristles are stiff so it really gets the gunk out .
The title says RED GLITTER case! it was just a clear red case.  never again they are horrible! Bullshit ass .
Absolutely satisfied. Perfect! Been in the market for a great pair of sunglasses not the ones you spend $10 and break shortly after. Almost a year now and they're all I wear .
Not bulky at all. Haven't dropped my phone yet to test the durability & not intending to. The clear case is great and I love it .
tHIS IS THE BEST SHOW EVER,QUALITY WAS FANTASTIC. cAN NOT WAIT INTILL THE SHOW STARTS AGAIN. lOVE THE ARTISTS, LOVE THE STORY LINE .
worked out well for my cruella costume. Doesn't come with a fake cigar, so I made one out of paper and painted it with an orange marker .
when I saw this jacket at amazon i really wanted it, it's perfect for this season and it's not one of these huge warm jackets, it's comfortable and soft.if you want an stylish jacket and at the sometime warm. BUY THIS NOWW .
Great sound for a little waterproof speaker and pretty awesome to be able to answer and make calls when in the shower and I can't bring my phone in there with me. Battery last super long, almost 1 month with using it in the shower every morning! I love the Tonez Audio AQUA .
When I received this product I noticed that one of the battery packs would not charge at all and the second one would not hold a charge for more than a few hours (not active use). I contacted MadCatz customer service about the issue and they offered their standard version as a replacement. I addressed to the replacement but they never send a replacement and now the return window has ended with amazon they will no longer reply to me e-mails. It has been a month since they last responded to my e-mails and now I stuck with a half working charging system. I would stay away from this company's products in future .
i bought it as a gift for my husbands birthday, he loves it can't stop talking about it, thanks for everything .
OMG... I just realized that I'm the female version of Dad.  Not often do I read a laugh out loud book. My girls agree that this is s*** that I would say. Absolutely love it .
Dell Laptop BateryDidn't give it 5 stars because I don't know how long it will last and be able to hold its charger.The original lasted a couple of years .
Could not ask for anything better than this. Sony never fails me. Tried Sennheiser, Soul and Beats, nothing can top this badass .
The reason why i got  chromebook was to go on the enternet and play games and watch movies.It dose not have a slot to put a movie in and sometimes you can not go on a website and there is not a lot a gb .
So I ordered the case thinking it would be like a cheaper version of a lifeprof, but it wouldn't even fit my phone! It said it was for the samsung galaxy s4 and that is just what I have. Some of the reveiws were good so I thought I should try it out. Like I said, didn't fit! DO NOT TRUST! I was going to return it but that would cost more than the phone case so forget it! Again DO NOT TRUST! Please take my word and do not buy it will save you disappointment, time, and money .
Not the best laptop, Like windows 8 better, but if you are looking for a light and cheap laptop for school this would be the one .
Not as sturdy as I wanted, and way to many air pockets that show, but it is my favorite color .
It did exactly what i wanted it to do it was the very same as i recieved with my tv no second hand replacement .
i got this tablet last day and it looks very good. nice screen but the package came damage . the box was ripped off and i don't know what happened . the problem is as soon as turned it on, it blinking and blinking and i don't know why . still deciding if should replace it or not .
If you are looking for a dating site that protects your interests, this is not it. Identity is verified by phone, email, and Facebook. If they really are who they say they are, they would have at least one friend. Anyone can start a new email in just a few minutes. ... if you don't want to be scammed, this is nor the site for you .
thay look good.I did not get them in yet.if thay sound as thay look.thay be perfect.thsnks  PS. fast in shiping .
Works well, came at a great cost, recieved two at a very good price.Couldn't beat it knowing some of the prices I found. Easy to Install .
Realmente es bueno el producto, me gusto.  Funcion&oacute; a la perfecci&oacute;n. Fue el equipo que solicite con las caracter&iacute;sticas que promocionaba .
Me enviaron un blackberry con defectos, tristemente es un simple tel&eacute;fono, no le sirvi&oacute;: 3G y no tiene disponibilidad para los servicios de Internet .
It was a very good book. I recommend it to everybody. It's funny and keeps you interested the whole way through. I couldn't put it down .
This one album is my favorite. I love EVERY single song on here, Luis Miguel NEVER disappoints. Alot of people my age don't really listen to this music or like him, but i grew up on listening to this & in my opinion Luis Miguel is the BEST artist M&eacute;xico has .
One or Luis MIguel's Best Albums! I Love every song on here! All his music is Great he never disappoints but in my opinion My Favorites are 20 A&ntilde;os, Soy Como Quiero Ser & Busca una Mujer. Shame i wasn't alive during that era hahaha ^ ^ Luis MIguel is the Best M&eacute;xico has to offer, Very unique, if your a fan of frank sinatra or etc... & you want something modern sounding this is it! & not to mention he is also on duets with Mr. Sinatra .
The banana stand provides the utility it promises to. It has a stable base and doesn't wobble. My review doesn't consider its design features .
These extensions do not style in any way what so ever. They are advertised as heat styleable and they are very poor quality .
Muy buen short para correr. sumamente recomendable como todos los productos Adidas.  Si lo que buscas es comodidad, no lo dudes .
it is a little large and the clip is a little weak it comes off some times when you sit down its not as slim as some .
I'm 39yrs old, people tell me I look 30, but I still don't want to dress or wear anything that a teen or someone in their 20's would. I'm a bit bored with red, but I don't like pink. This is the perfect combination. It has no shimmer, which I like .
I would like these to be a bit wider & longer. I'm a shoe size 8 in medium width & felt these were a bit small. Having said that, these do keep your toes warm though. I place them all the way to the front of my shoe, even though it leaves my heel uncovered. Unfortunately they do not last for more than about 4hrs. I purchased an entire box and have found this to be the case with every insole pair I've used. The ad does say &#34;up to......&#34; That's still 4hrs of warmth. A bit expensive though. I will still buy them again. If you have to be out in below freezing temperature, any little bit helps .
I wear these under my long sleeve thermal & sweater, so that I don't have to wear a coat. (the bulkiness bothers me) Were it not for the tight upper arm band, I would've given this 5 stars. Although, I may have simply purchased the wrong size for myself. They definitely help keep me warm.  I will purchase again in the future .
I ordered one of these, then after a couple weeks ordered three more. Initially I only wanted it for the dogs bed area, but this works so well, that I also ordered one for each bedroom. My favorite thing about this is that it is fragrance free! I am very sensitive to anything with a slight perfume odor, triggers my headaches. This is natural, has NO scent and removes stuffy or smelly scents, no masking with any fragrance. I'm a clean and organized person, I keep my house spotless, other than the dog hairs here and there. Even my house has a smell to it because of our dog. Not anymore. I LUV this product. Plus it's inexpensive, considering it lasts two years .
They did not fit my wooden hangers. Weird. I have standard wooden hangers. What a waste of time & money .
This is more of a cement or porcelain material. I can't describe it but it's definitely not metal or steel. If I were to drop this, it would break .
This is one of those stories that keeps you wanting to turn the page and find out what happens next. I loved it can't wait to see what happens in the next book .
This book is awesome ,you will love it , sink your fangs into this great book. You will not be disappointed .
I don't like this at all.  Low budget.  Too fast paced and overall boring game.  It sucks really really bad .
This is for an iphone, so I couldn't use it on my Kindle Fire.  I couldn't even open it up on a Kindle .
I thought this was going to be a game - but it is not a game.  Do not purchase if you want to play a game .
You can't take pictures like a other tablets do. the camera should be on the backside instead of facing you. I haven't figure out the video yet. It all seems so confusing .
Well made and durable. Worth the wait to receive. Trust you won't go wrong picking up a set. Everyone of my friends love them and ask where I bought them .
Finding Momentum:  I  loved the book.. can't wait for the next one to come out.. This woman is one of the best.. You can really learn from her. She will tell you the truth of what she feels instead of what she thinks you want to hear..Looking forward too many more books from her..Very much worth reading..rated 5 stars .
I've never worn other cycling bibs or shorts, so this was my first. I have no complaints about them. II WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT- The ad says something about ''gel'' , there is no gel. The chamois is a foam material.I put this in the washer and dryer without issue .
I chose this rating for Two Face because it is truly a turn page book. I couldn't put it down when I started because I had to get to the ending. This was a awesome book .
I thought this deserved a 5 star rating because this book touched on so many life's circumstances for our youth and they can really learn that whatever their situation is they don't have to go through it by themselves. Thank you Trae Ferguson for your vision .
I bought this and never got it, I told them and they just gave me the rudest feedback ever, basically saying I just have to buy a new one .
the plane is very lightweight and flys fast. when i received it one of the motor wires wasn't plugged in all the way,but was as easy as plugging it back in.goes together pretty easy and theres just enough glue provided.the esc cut-off button on the side for the motor is a nice feature incase you plug the power in and your throttle is not set to zero .
recieved the item pretty quick and broke even quicker. wing is paper thin. first flight,went up,rolled,crashed. wing busted in 3 peices. i fly 4 channel planes and this is a trainer? all it trains to do is crash.it doesn't fly at all.the remote charged the battery for 3 minutes and never charged again. on/off button on remote doesnt even stay on.i would have had more fun tearing up the money spent on this thing .
I purchased this for the sole purpose of lowering my blood pressure. When I started it was about 150/95. After using twice a day for several weekes now my pressure is 180/110!! Not good. I finally had to go and get medication from my doctor. I am not happy at all with this product. The fish peptides I used to take worked much better. I would not suggest buying this product .
There was no screw package, so i couln't connect components. I hope they send as soon as possible as it is useless without screws .
This phone sucks.I ended up going to Verizon and getting a Razor M.I never used the phone and would like some type of refund on it .
I love the product, it fits comfortable. this product is not just comfortable for sport but also everyday wearing! love it .
I love them, they are pretty thin but still manage to stay up with my garter skirt. The design on the side is not as defined as it is in the photo but it's still cute. Shipping was about 3 days bit too bad with Amazon prime .
first off, the case is not white as it appears in the photo, next it's too small, i thought it would fit since it says it's for the galaxy S2 i have the one from sprint. also took a long time to get here, but hey free shipping, otherwise it's cute, just wished it fit my phone .
I have used the wipes two times now within the last couple of weeks and do notice an improvement in the amount of sweat that I sweat. Of course I don't believe there is any product which can completely eliminate it but this product does seem to help alot. I just wish I could get it more onto my scalp where most of my sweat starts from. I do appreciate the effort this company is putting into this very embarrassing sweat problem I have and do hope that maybe they can think of a way to incorporate it into a type of shampoo or conditioner as I think this would be a great way to stop the sweat. My head is really the only place where I have this problem but of course this is a very obvious place. Thank You .
a little on the small side but still works. In the reviews some were stating that the holes do not ling up with snaps on race numbers, this is correct but you just make your own holes. No big deal .
I absolutely love this book trilogy! J.R.R. Tolkien is an incredible author!  Can't wait to read another book of his .
I have just put 500 km on these tires and have to say that there is nothing better out there that I have riden. Supple, light and tacky then Pro 4's and other Vittoria tires I've tried. I'm not a continental tire guy so I cannot compare them to those tires. I do plan on getting another set for back-up .
It works just the way it described it would work. It fits well under most clothing and makes your stomach area look nice and flat. Although I don't wear it all the time, it comes in handy when I want that extra toned look in my midriff area. Wonderful product .
Did not work in my epson CX7400. Wasted mt money. Don't waste yours. Went to store ,paid top dollar for epson ink . It worked .
The box is nice . What's inside was awful. Waste of money. Everyone that tried them did not like them.Yuk .
The package contained only the CD, nothing else.  I had to search the internet to find out how to install and use it.  Once I had it figure out it works most of the time .
Installation was a breeze, restarted lap top  and was recognized immediately.  No problems so far.  Nothing more to say, period .
i never recieved this phone case that was very dissappointing u really wanted this case but had to buy it elsewhere .
Now This Product Almost BLew The RestOff The Shelves...untill It Was Time To Dock It, Use GeneNeric Charger, Etc...the Plugin Holes Are Very Precise Which MAKes The Product Not So VErsatile So if You Are A Docker At Night And Got YouRself BeeFy Headphones YOu WanT To Make Sure It Fits. Quality anD Fit Are A Ten .
great writing and great casting....the plot line keeps you guessing and the surprises never stop.  just love this show and can't wait to get caught up so I can start watching the current season .
I just love English dramas...actually I really love all English tv....the writing is always very smart and very funny....Season two was as good as season one...was not disappointing at all.  On to Season 3 .
The "KOMPUTERBAY 1GB PC3200 Memory Upgrade for DELL Dimension 1100, 2400, 3000, 8300, B110, Op..." was tested after the insertion of two sticks (worked out a few pennies cheaper than buying their 2x1GB module kit) and Memtest showed no errors.The upgrade was for an Dimension 2400, and the machine instantly recognized the memory without any installation issues.The improved computer performance was exactly as anticipated.The modules arrived ahead of the expected date properly packaged.In conclusion use this cheap ... er ... inexpensive memory upgrade for your compatible machine especially the DELL Dimension 2400 [which is what I used it on .
I was soooo upset. I was looking forward to this case. Then when I get it....it was got the HTC Incredible and not the HTC Windows 8X. Someone should really do something about this .
My toddler loves sitting in the back and the buckles are 3 pts harness to she can't escape. Recommend for an older/younger sibling pair.. But i suppose it would work well for 2 toddlers. Makes my daughter feel like a big kid .
Did not care for the watch. It looked like it came out of a 50 cent gumball machine. Returned the item the day after I received it. I do compliment Amazon on their outstanding service .
It's a good knife, but it's not as sharp as you would think. I hope you like to sharpen knives though because this one will need it! Otherwise It is a very good knife now that it's razor sharp! I can't wait to test it out .
This charger stopped working after using 3 months with no lights on. I didn't use this heavily AT ALL. SO disappointed! Any idea why this happens?! Can you replace with a new one .
I was greatly offended by the subtle attempts of the authors to influence the students' opinion of socialism. Coupled with an explanation of how to influence people, it came across as indoctrination. They clearly had their own agenda and it wasn't to present objective information on how human beings behave.What these Californians desire is to see is an America where the people are completely disarmed and subject to the will and force of an elite few. They expect people to believe that a corrupt government, taxing people into the ground, and re-distributing wealth to people with more skin color will create a better world. What they are teaching is not true tolerance or equality, but a new form of prejudice that is thinly disguised as tolerance.It is apparent from their writings that they lack a firm grasp of Southern history, culture, and present day challenges-never-mind the principles the Unitied States Was founded on. They love to bring up racism and the South, but fail to explain the Civil War was started over tariffs, not slaves. Of course they're not going bring up the buildings built on top of slave graveyards in New York; that doesn't fit their southerners-are-the-devil agenda.They bring up violence in the South, but fail to mention that cities with the highest rates of gun crime are some in the north with the strictest gun control laws, like Chicago and Washington D.C. Why? The truth doesn't fit their agenda.I am a descendent of immigrants (legal immigrants) who learned to speak English. Expecting people to legally immigrate, speak English, and obey our laws isn't racism; it's law and order. It's easy for some city slickers from L.A. to call border security racism; they haven't had to live in a border town and be terrorized by the Mexican drug wars spilling over into the states.I could write an entire paper on how much these commies are full it, but it can be summed quickly; they are disguising a political agenda to transform the U.S. into something akin to the USSR as social agenda for false equality and tolerance. Anyone who doesn't agree with this agenda is labeled a racist, a bigot, or just another backwards southerner. I have no complaints about my teacher, but this book isn't about education; it's about indoctrination.-An Angry Texan .
The game is much creative, making those who seldom play games -me, instantly play it for half an hour. The only anxiety is the goal is seemingly too simple? I wonder if the game will be over once all objects are purchased? Sadly, I would never know, but it is quite a good game nevertheless .
We have 4 dogs and I was tired of the monthly maintenance (and mess) of the topicals. My Vet advertised and recommended this product. After using it, I can honestly say I never saw a flea or tick for the entire 8 months! Also, there were no side affects such as oily residue or odor. LOVE this product .
I received my BP cuff not calibrated! And I start school in a week! So returning the product this late and getting a new one is not worth it because they may send me another one with the same problem and waiting for it will be too long, plus I would have miss some of the sessions at school for not having it on time. I would of expected Prestige Medical to check their BP' s before sending it to the customers! They should take out the word (Medical) from their slogan because they obviously don't know how to send good products to students etc... That are in the medical field .
This Is such and amazing value! very sturdy well built wall mount! i would recommend this to anyone who wants to hang their tv and does not want to pay $100 for no reason for a mount .
Well built solid tool. it will definetly last for years. if your in the market for this tool don't hesitate to buy this on you will not be dissapointed .
The book kept my interest until the motel era. i can't believe they were there only a couple of days it felt like a week.i get it he is a saint in her eyes but 4 chapters of the same bla bla bla .
Overall thus thing is well built, and the quality is a B+ average on my scale. No degraded quality of sound. This will power even the most high ohm set of headphones. I mean it goes up to +20db! If you can help it, don't compare this to the whirlwind PA-1. That thing is awesome, but it $200... All in all great little box. If I had too I would buy again .
Overall, not too bad. Good connectors, good length, ect. They're a little thinner in guage than I thought they might be. Because the page for this item doesn't give a lot of info, I had to go off reviews. In some of those reviews, they say the cables come with cable ties... False. Mine did not. I must agree however with the 50/50 chance of getting a really good one. None, I repeate none, are any less then whirlwind quality. (If you have bought whirlwind in the past). I would say 8 out of the 10 were rock solid, just as I expected. As far as value goes, almost unbeatable .
I very highly recommend these cables. Improved my tone quality 80%. And that's coming from live wire cables. When it comes down too it, these aren't that much $$$, go look and see how much lava cables, or some monster cables are. At least $50, but you get what you pay for. You defiantly get your  &#34;bang for your buck&#34; with these. In fact I think I might just order some more .
Just wow! Not only do they sound great, they look good, and are very lightweight. If you are debating getting these, or the Shure SE215's, GET THESE! You won't be disappointed. If you are looking for something with a lot of bass, look elsewhere. These have a very flat response. Yet distinguishable lows, and crisp highs. As a plus they are loud! Be sure to refer to the chart in the instruction about the amount of time they can produce the coresponding spl output, or else you will blow them. As mentioned earlier, they look good (if you can see them, I got the clear ones), also lightweight. As a guitarist the cable running to my limiter/amp runs right up with my guitar cable! Perfect! Overall great quality, and pice .
Eureka, I finally found a tub mat that does not bunch up or slide around and with heavy edges that stay flat against the tub. The relief from fear of the mat slipping and causing a fall makes the extra cost worth every dime.  The favorable reviews were on target and the reason I made my order.  Now that I've tested the mat for myself,  I'd recommend the large sized mat for anyone -  especially those at increased risk of falling while bathing .
After years of struggling with toilet seats that had only two small nylon fasteners, it is such a relief to find a product that has secure metal fittings.  The packaging was unbelievable, packed as if it were jewelry or fine china to protect that lovely shiny  finish.  The only critique I could offer is that for people who are not familiar with toilet installations, the instructions are next to none.  How helpful it would be if the manufacturer added a small direction sheet so the novice would know the proper sequence in installation of the attachments to achieve a solid level seat.  My husband had no problems because he is familiar with such things but we both noted that a novice would not know the proper sequence for fasteners, which goes first, etc.  As for me, I am sold on this product as being exactly as described and far nicer looking than those available locally.  My main criteria was a solid seat, no shifting during movement, so the beautiful finish was just icing on the cake.  Great product and super packing .
Very sweet, but somewhat predictable flick. I like the fact that the ending wasn't too predictable, it left me with a satisfied feeling, that a bite of life movie should .
I love city story so so much it kicks @ss!I haven't played this yet but club story city story and zoo story rock so........can't wait .
Excellent product very satisfied, I use it every day with no signs of wear, looks good also and very comfortable .
Honestly, I was very surprised to find how much I really enjoyed this book.  I really did not know what to expect, but what I found was a well told story that kept me captivated the whole time, I found myself thinking about it when I was not reading, and wanting to know what was coming next.  The day the I finished the book I realized how bummed I was to have it end,I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good story, full of adventure, passion, and suspense all rolled into one.Enjoy .
It is awesome!!!! It has a elastic band that goes around your neck and isn't really fittable for adults but I would recommend it for kids .
love this natural concept  of an interactive toy  for my  cats  finally no  plastic  anymore  just pure nature  in funny forms .
this cd has some gems but for the most part these are hidden ,,the Cds are hard to figure what is what and many of the films are obscure but not great.. These Cds needs to be pruned and clearly titled .
My 9 year old son can't wait to read the next six books. They are free to borrow in the Kindle library but he goes through them so fast that I have to buy every other one .
Thank you for writing these books! I don't know what I'll want to read next once I'm finished with all the books. - from a 9 year old boy who eats cookies every day and reads Diary of a Sixth Grade Ninja books .
This styptic powder works! I was looking at a similar product with a lot of complaints about the rough texture of the powder and containers being open and looking used. This one was sealed, the texture of the powder was fine, and (from experience) stopped the bleeding in no time flat .
This book is funny and gross. We had a good time reading it. We cannot wait to read the Fart series. I am a 40 year old mom reading with my 9 year old son. We thought it was awesome .
This casino is a blast. It has good variety and is pretty realistic. All the fun at a fraction of the cost of real slot play. The house always wins after all .
The PetMagasin Dog Nail Clippers did the job. The customer service from PetMagasin is top notch too.They really want you to be 100% satisfied. The clipper came with good directions and, being a first timer, I was prepared with the styptic powder. Unfortunately, I had to use it on the final clip. My dog was trying to tell me no, but I didn't listen. I do recommend bathing the dog first to soften the nails so they don't crack and I do recommend listening to your dog .
Extremely cheap quality, not what is pictured. Claims to be durable, yet this plastic, horrible excuse for an envelope is anything but "durable". High efficient? PLEASE! I am so unhappy with this purchase. Truly a waste of my money. Not to mention the delay on shipment .
Purchased this for our lego birthday party - it was perfect, and exactly as described.  Brand new lego pieces - 650 - colorful bricks.  You won't get any 'special' pieces - they're all pretty boring, but perfect for giving away in goody bags .
iMac (late 2013) with OSX 10.9 - this device must be directly attached to the computer. It does not tolerate even being on a good USB 3.0 hub like Anker.  The latest ones are shipping with firmware at a higher level than the firmware patch for Mavericks, so there's no need (or ability) to patch it.As a side note, it also isn't supported by Windows 7 under VMWare Fusion even if directly attached...  The drivers don't load properly.  May need Windows 8, I guess .
It would probably take this charger 4 hours or even more to completely charge a nexus 5. Not to forget that cord is short. Do NOT buy the product without reading the description and reviews, as I did.  The seller specially called me requesting a positive review if the product turned out to be nice, which is why I am forced to write ac review to warn other prospective buyers .
I didn't think I'd like these when I got them, put them on and they have been comfortable.  I wear them everyday because of plantar fasciitis and they help .
I bought 2 small and 2 large toys thinking they would be good for my dogs and for using with clients' dogs.  I was very disappointed to find that even the small was almost too large for my Labs!  My dogs did play with them but they are made of hard plastic, not rubber and I found my male dog starting to chew up the top portion so I took it away immediately.  I would not ever let them play with these unattended.  I shipped the large ones back.  They were so large you would need a Mastiff to handle them.  I would not buy them again .
Not what I expected .
Awesome, but suction cup is not the best .
great game I enjoyed it and it was nice that it was not only hidden object, but also there was a story behind it. also liked the fact that I could play for 5 minutes or 20. and still came back to where I left off .
Though it's a little clunky and cumbersome, since it was a little bigger than expected, it's not bad. It's great for whatever you need to bring along with you, and has a lot of compartments. Only real gripe is that the strap squeaks a lot .
As expected&#65292;Rockport never let me down&#65292;it fits me well&#65292;and very comfortable&#65292;I will get some more&#65292;fat man needs to choose larger size or wider&#12290 .
First off the rifle is extremely solid. It has a good weight to it and there's a nice feel to it. Secondly, it has power to it. The sights however aren't the best, but it says in the guide that the first hundred shots should not as great.I would definitely buy a another one if I had to, but I don't see mine breaking any time soon .
The limited access to jacks don't bother me much. The purpose is to protect the zune. I also mentions no belt clip. You should know what you're getting .
The rifle feels cheap and the sights are ok. Overall it does the job, but you can't shake the feeling that the rifle could break apart in your hands .
It is cheaper than game stop and works just fine. There isn't much to say about a memory card any way .
con solo un incencio aromatizo todo el departamento,tiene rico aroma y no empalaga y me gusta ponerlo todos los dias .
The only flaw in this book was, simply, it ending. This story was one deeply rooted  in the complicated intricacies of human sentience, leaving  me feeling empty after I had finished.... Leaving me to ask myself the notorious question : what do I do now that I've finished a book that no other could ever measure up to .
This book has you hanging on until the very last page. If you love romance, adventure, and comedy, then you will love this book. It has twists and turns and unexpected surprises that every reader loves to read. You won't be sorry once you picked up this book .
This onesie is great! It fits me perfectly- I'm pretty small, only 1,62m and the legs are not too long, which doesn't happen a lot! It is unbelievably comfy and soft.I did not expect it to have such a great quality, since it's (compared to other websites that sell onesies) &#34;cheap&#34;.I definitely do not regret spending the money on this onesie! Everything comes as it's said in the description. All in all- great .
Nice shirt came in good condition and i was not disapointed by the quality it looks like it will last a long time .
They are awesome!!!  Reggie Wayne if the Indianapolis Colts has one also.  I love the sound and I don't have to charge for at least two or three days .
This sound bar wasn't on our radar. We bought a Samsung TV and were going to get a samsung sound bar (actually were going to get the Sony HTC-T260H), but we were told we couldn't use one remote. We were told to use the Polk 5000. After listening to it at the store I couldn't bring myself to buy it. The other option was the Onkyo LS-B50. We got it. Set up was amazingly easy and the system paired itself with the remote instantly. The sound quality was wonderful and the bass was superb. It is in our bedroom which has vaulted ceilings and is 20' x 25'. It definitely filled the room and wasn't even near the high end of the volume. I would highly recommend this .
The case covers my phone, yea ... but it broke a litle the first time I dropped my phone ... one of the pieces that holds the back of the case to the back of my phone broke to be specific so now the back comes off sometimes ... oh and it seems as if the back is rubber bt the front is plastice ... not cool .
Item fit exactly as it was supposed to. Packaging was good. Hardest thing I had was finding instructions to do the replacement for my exact vehicle. Not any problem with the handle just have that info available .
Have not finished reading the novel.The author is able to keep your interest while detailing everything he is writing about.It is a great book to read at night before I go to sleep and with a cup of coffee in the morning!His descriptive writing gives me the feeling like I am right there .
They are as advertised. A good read, with good humor. Not an attempt to be overly serious. Could have contained some professional oversight, however .
On -Off switch broke after just a few  times of use. No product guarantee that I could find. Not very well made .
Good book, lots of potential for future stories!!!I loved Deanna character and Talon was super hot!!!!  Can't wait for the next installment .
Outstanding, but you can't really get far without spending money. Still, a great game. Much better than others I have tried .
did not like this at all wish I never got it. don't  waste your money. if it was a real book I would let my dog tear it up .
Was very easy to set up and right away we got a LOT more channels and they are crystal clear! I'm especially happy that we don't have to move the antenna when changing any of the channels-they all just come in so very clear! I would definitely purchase again .
Wrong case so upset I didn't want tl bring back I pay more to send back so I just keep. Not satisfy at all .
I checked the price for an HP 12A toner cartridge at a well known office supplies chain store. The price was around $79.90. Then I went to Amazon and found one for around $19 plus shipping. When it arrived, the only thing I noticed was that the box itself was torn on one end. The toner cartridge still had the manufactures' heavy bubble wrap, no damage to the cartridge. It works perfectly. What a great deal. I'll reorder without a doubt!Charlie H .
Great book! Roni Loren does an amazing job writing. She is one of my favorite authors. I read this book in a total of one night because I could not put the book down. I would read it again. Thank you Roni Loren .
Incredible!!  Not only does she have an amazing voice but these songs are a great way to worship through song .
It's totally worth the price! And it's stylish too! And not as expensive as some other g shocks. Some of the other prices are ridiculous .
My dog just loves the sausage treats they make.  I find the sausage style is best for carrying around because of their smaller size, I can keep a few in my pocket and reward her as we walk. They look very tasty and if you hadn't known they were for dogs I would easily mistake them for food. The package says Human grade ingredients so that could be the reason why .
My pit/??? mix just can't get enough of these treats! He's jumping as soon as I reach for the bag.  They smell great and look very tasty (I wonder.. J/K) I need to get some more of these soon, nothing like a pit mix mad at his owner. I would recommend these to any owner who is concerned about what he feeds his pet .
Product description clearly states that the Made in the USA but on arrival found that the dress is made in China, and the color and pattern does not match the picture in the product description. This dress I bought my wife. I am extremely disappointed .
This was supposed to be a comedy movie, but the problem with comedies is they sometimes make you feel like a real jerk with not much of a brain.  Not worth watching .
I was not sure this was a movie I would watch, but I did.  I could not get this movie out of my head when it had finish.  How true it was I do not know, but this man did exist.  I googled him.  Great movie with sensitivity .
Really good quality. Not just them really cheap made Gauges. I recommend if you want some good flexi gauges choose these cause I couldn't be anymore happy with my purchase .
The book was pretty good, I just didn't like the way it ended. Is there a part two to this maybe .
Product was precisely as advertised.  Very pleased to have found it.  As a matter of fact, it was an exact match to the existing unit that has been in service by the kitchen sink for over 40 yrs.  Never though I'd find another.  Thank you .
The cover wasn't perfect but the rest of the pages were in very good condition.I enjoyed reading and catching up with the series.I recommend the series to those who like Shonen manga .
The book came in good condition, no missing pagesI enjoyed catching up with the seriesI recommend this to anyone that reads Shonen manga .
This plush doll came in good conditionNo damages of any sortsI recommend this product to those who live bleach and collecting plush dolls .
The cards came in good condition.Nothing was missing. I enjoy having them.I recommend this product to those who like playing cards and the anime/manga Bleach .
For the most part the product is in a good condition for the most partThere is only one small damage but nothing major.The Delivery didn't take very long .
The cards came in good condition.Nothing was missing. I enjoy having them.I recommend this product to those who like playing cards and the manga/anime Soul Eater .
Nothing was missing.There was a few small damages but nothing majorIt helped me organize my books in my bedroom.I recommend this to anyone that needs a shelve for any need thinkable .
I was really disapointeted  when I got this dress and it didn't fit. I really wanted this dress and was thinking of ordering other ones but they run too small. I am a size 12 with some junk in the trunk and figured the size Large would be fine for me cause that is my actual size but this dress seems like it was for a size 8. I don't even think an XL would have fit me either. They should say this in the details .
Beautiful  I love the color the only thing the earring backs are not secure enough but overall I love them .
This figure's pretty cool. It's about nine inches tall, and made of solid PVC.This figure is Trunks from the ninth Dragon Ball Z animated feature, known as &#34;Bojack Unbound&#34; in English, and is an limited edition because it features his jacket. The original addition of the figure is him without his jacket.The main issue I have is that he's not very articulated, and the facial sculpt is a little weird. Other than that, this is a cool figure to own. I recommend for any anime fan .
I'm left handed, and as a result, I hate having to use my right hand to do things. This mouse is right-hand exclusive, and can't be programmed to be a left handed one.Other than that annoying inconvenience, I've never had any problems with it .
I honestly thought that this figure would be bigger, but it's only six inches high, and not the eight that is stated in the product specs. But either way, this figure is really cool, and a must for all Dragon Ball fans.I also honestly believed that this figure would be a hollow PVC when I bought it, but was thrilled when I discovered it was solid. It's quite heavy for a six inch figure.The figure comes in four pieces, (upper half, belt, legs, and base) and is fairly quick and easy to assemble. The sculpt on it is amazing for a six inch figure, and looks amazingly like Goku from the series; from the facial sculpt down to the details of the clothing. Even the locks of hair that hang down above his eyes are sculpted separately from his forehead. The sculptor's three-dimensional accuracy in capturing the two-dimensional art style of Akira Toriyama is not something I'm used to seeing, especially in a figure this size.The illustration that this figure was primarily sculpted from can be found on page 98 in the first Daizenshuu (Known as "Dragon Ball: The Complete Illustrations" in the United States). The only difference between the figure and the illustration in the book is that the kanji on the back of his gi are different. On the figure, we have the Kame Turtle symbol, which is the one that Goku is most synonymous with. The original illustration features the Kaio symbol, which Goku has during the late Saiyan arc into the early Freeza arc.This is the only figure from this line that I own, but I will most likely purchase more due to how good a quality that it is. I recommend this for any fan of the series, or a fan of anime in general .
This figure of Ox King is amazing. This version of him is from his first appearance in the original Dragon Ball series, and not him from Dragon Ball Z.He comes in eight pieces:*Base*Upper half*Lower half*Head*Axe*Cape*Head Feather*Belt tieHe stands about seven inches tall from base to head feather. The only downside to this figure is that he's not to-scale when compared to the rest of the characters in this series. In the series, he's about three times the size of everyone else, but he's about the same size as the other characters in this line. In spite of this, I definitely recommend this figure for any true Dragon Ball fan .
This figure of Launch is really amazing, and is sculpted from the artwork of the first moment she appears in the series when she's being chased by the cops after a robbery.This figure stands about 5.5 inches tall from the bottom of the base to the top of her hair. The detail on the figure is incredible, even the money flying from the bag has a particular pattern on it, simulating a print.The figure comes in four pieces: Base, "bike", Launch's bottom half, and her top half. The figure is made primarily of solid PVC, but certain features such as the dust from the wheel and the light covers on the bike are made of translucent acrylic. The electrical control panel on the bike has even been painted to look as if it's displaying information.This is perhaps one of the only Launch statues and figures on the market, and even though I'm not particular toward her character, this figure has incredible detail and is worth the price .
I loved this book. It was definitely worth reading. I liked how original it was. It wasn't like all the other books I've read where it seemed like you've all ready some of it because of the similarities to other books .
I couldn't but this book down. I hope they make it into a movie someday soon. I would watch it over an over again .
I could not book this book down. It held my interest through the whole book .I haven't read a good book in a long time an I was starting to wonder if there where any good books left .
It was very boring. It wasn't a bad story. It was just wrote wrong or something. I guess I was looking for a little more wow factor an this book didn't have it .
I couldn't put this book down. I read it in one sitting. I will definitely be reading more book's written by this author .
This has to have been the dumbest book I have ever read. It didn't even end. It was horrible. Please I beg of you don't waste even one minute of your time on this book it's seriously not worth it .
The cross screwdriver doesn't work at all, which is the most important screwdriver for the galaxy S4 screws. However, everything else is perfect .
The head was fragile, and it broke from the first use; also,the hose is not fully closed. However, generally it is good .
this item does the job.  but be careful.  you will end up pinching yourself in one of those &#34;wdf, that hurt&#34; moments.  it's not an everyday use item unless you're making id's or keycards everyday.  but the product works.  carries a price tag that seems high .
in AK, office/copy paper will cost you an arm and a leg.  sure in the larger cities where office depot is around.. no problem.  but in the smaller towns, a case of paper runs nearly $70-80.  order from office depot?  $45.. plus $40 shipping.  yea, not worth it that way.def love amazon prime shipping .
i picked this up to help with my allergies.  i'm not too sure if this really did anything.i did read online that this also helps with urinary problems.  not what i got this for, but yea..  i did notice a difference in that area .
this item was worth it when it was $8.. and that was a stretch.  it seems they raise the price on anything that moves well.but besides that, i'd say 1 out of 4 won't make it after first month of extended use .
haven't had a problem with these cartridges in my wf3540.  clean and crisp lines and texts.  def recommend and will buy again11/18/13i have had a company send me cartridges for the wf3540.  their ink quality is nowhere near the quality of epson ink.  color printing was a joke and there were different color lines through all color printing.  everyone is looking for a deal.  i just haven't found a better alternative to epson ink .
quick set up, even able to print remotely off phone when networked.  no problems so far.  it does the job and i have no complaints .
my housekeepers like this product.  idk if it really makes their jobs easier or if it's because it's something new for them to use.  it doesn't extend super long, but high enough to reach normal ceilings.  simple to extend, easy to remove the microfiber cloth .
when this first arrived, it worked like a charm.  i'm always running around without access to a wall/car charger and usually have to charge my phone atleast three times a day.  2.5 months later this thing can get charged, but will only charge my phone for 5 minutes.  but nothing beyond that.  this is has become a great paper weight.  very disappointed.UPDATE:2-18-14Anker's Customer service have responded and is in process of sending a new one out.  will update upon the arrival and status of new battery .
Color is much lighter when I recieved it and I bought the bumper for my son since I was looking for a plain red, however it came with ruffles which does not state. Soooo unhappy .
The poles have a tiny plastic piece that is apparently really easy to break, because neither of the poles will tighten down due to that plastic piece being broke .
We've bought several types of sippy cups and finally have found one that our son likes and doesn't leak!!We bought them in the 7oz and 10oz. Love them .
I bought this net and it is not only huge, its very well made and I could not be happier.  Every day that my fish are safe from critters getting into my pond makes me smile.  I look outside to see the critters sitting along the side of my pond viewing my fish and NOT eating them. Thank you for a wonderful product .
The boot calf was huge. I ordered another pair size 9 and they do not come in half sizes, so ordering the 10 fit was very huge .  I will return .

This was a very interesting read and something that definitely needs to be read and understood in today's society, both by believers and unbelievers alike.  There are plenty of believers out there who don't truly understand the meaning of Christmas, or have wrong misconceptions, including myself.  Of course, unbelievers haven't been enlightened to the true meaning of Christmas yet.  These sermons confront so many issues related to Christmas: worship, angels, the incarnate Christ, amongst other things.  These sermons could be read for more understanding, or even taught by preachers or teachers during the Christmas season in order for the Church to gain a better understanding of what our hearts should look like at Christmas, and during everyday life.  It will also educate people on the personages of the Christmas season.  It does a good job of keeping attention by providing real life stories relative to the content being discussed.  Very good and highly recommendable .
It was a little older of a movie, in all, kind of slow.  If you have not seen it before it is not worth the time .
I chose this product because I knew it worked.  I do not even have to use the shock just click on the alarm to remind my dog not to do what ever she is doing wrong .
Wow, this really saved me.  My dog carried it outside and if I would not have had my leather case on my Nexus 7 it would have been a total loss.  Thank you Nexus .
Me pareci&oacute; un libro magnifico, mas que por el tema en si, por el excelente castellano utilizado por el traductor. Considero que vale la pena ser le&iacute;do .
unit has good sound. cd & radio are ok., but the tape player destroyed 2 tapes the 1st night I had it. I borrow these tapes from my local library so I can not  have this. If Sony would rework their tape payer, they would have a good unit .
I haven't used it yet, but I am sure it will be fine. There is a small scratch on the top of the lid, but so what for the reduced price .
These books are the best books I have ever read I wish they were more of them  I can't wait for the movies .
The Digital Dollar book really helped me understand how to fit all the pieces of the online world together into a digitalroadmap strategy for my use. It explained, in simple terms, many parts of content management, internet marketing, mobile and social media that I was not sure about. I learned how important it was to manage and understand the relationship between my brand in bricks and mortar and my brand online.  The Insights, Tips and Advice sections help me take the right actions.  I'd recommend purchasing The Digital Dollar book to everyone who is interested in gaining a solid foundation on the internet; both for their personal use and for their business. Thanks for the guidance .
Awesome readCan not wait for the next book in the seriesHard to put down, and very well written .
this movie shows up under 3D MOVIES OFFERED!!!!!!!! However when you are FORCED to purchase the movie..(because for some reason you are not allowed to rent), it is availble in HD or normal with out any indication that IT IS NOT 3D.  NOW, I am sitting here looking at 3 very ANGRY little girls who would gladly scratch my eyes to the point of me perminatley needing to wear3D glasses just to see, if giving the chance.....Other then that, its GREAT .
It was a very poor quality .I replaced the bulb and the picture was so dark that you couldn't even see it .
hello used this puppywell its not a puppy its an amazing razor id like to say its purrty sweet and well made probably the best razor ive used so far i am impressed that is all bzz agent out .
Though this book was &#34;amazing&#34; i did have one problem... It ended wayyy too suddenly. I understand the marketing strategy to leave the ending open so the reader will be almost obligated to read the next book, but that's just not fair! Other than that, loved it .
AUTOBEST  F2978A  FUEL  PUMP  MODULE i love it  ,  i installed  it ,  the  instructions  were  not  hard  to follow ,  put  fuel  in,  started  on  first  try ,  pump  is  nice  an  quite  ,  thank  you ,  thank  you .  TONY  T .  THIS  IS  ABOUT  THE  AUTOBEST  F 2978A  FUEL  PUMP  MODULE .
Super fast shipping , nice looking product , so far I have not installed yet , might have to wait till  fall , but I am sure they will work just fine , everything I have got from amazon so far , has been great .
The other reviews are pretty accurate, except for the good ones!!  I am a Journeyman mechanic so take this for what it is worth.  Face plate is fairly cheap, was afraid I would break it when I put it on head unit, no joke.  Looks good in my truck, and was easy to install. This is the extent of positive things I have to say about it.  Screen stays blue all the time, no color changing or beat waves like many of its contemporaries have. Usb port in front is only good for thumb drives.  It advertises that it will work with I Phone and pods, and it does but with various expensive cords you have to buy separately.  My wife said it looks " ghetto".  DVD works fine, reads my Cd's as DVDs and won't play them.I don't usually write this kind of stuff, but I felt the need to worn others. I could have bought the Sony, or Pioneer from walmart for about the same price, and regret it every day!!!  I did some research about the brand and it got good reviews all and all, they must not have been talking about this head unit.  The owners manual is poorly written and at times it is not even spelled properly. Boss audios customer service is poor, and not very knowledgeable when it comes to this head unit. In short if you buy this head unit, don't expect much help from them.I don't think that Amazon and Boss have worked out some kind of "scam", and I'm going to see if I can return it tomorrow. I will let you know how it goes.I hope this helps and you all listen to this warning!!!!!!!Called BOSS and they could not help me, said it was a software problem and I needed to return it to AMAZON. Returned it to AMAZON and they will not give me my money back. Just to clarify AMAZON now has the headunit and my money, and I have nothing. Again don't by this head unit!!!!!! I am not so sure anymore that this is not a scam!!!!!!I bought this unit on 2/8/2013 new from AMAZON, to day is 3/6/2013!!!! Be warned!!!!!Afetr much argument and frustration I finally convinced AMAZON to return my money! I went out today and purchased a Kenwood KDC-200U, easy install, does exactly what it advertises, sounds great, and I am very happy.  If you wanted a head unit to read your Itunes files without having to mess with your phone, I would suggest this headunit. Tax and all I only payed $16.00 dollars more than the Boss and no problems at all. Even though it does not have the tiny screen on it I even think that the display looks better than the Boss.  Good luck .
Save your Money!! Couldn't Even Watch. I though this would be cool but man I was wrong total waste of money .
This was such a wast of money. SK energy is nasty an doesn't work nearly as good as other energy drinks .
These headphones just can't compare with simlar or even cheaper headphones.  Sound Quality is just not up to par! Waste of money for me .
Not comparable with other similar or even lower priced Headphones. These head phones are a pass. I can't recommend at all .
Total Crap it's a pass not even worth 50 cents. His latest music is just terrible total pass shouldn't have bought .
This special was not good at all. Way better stand up out their. Complete waste of money seriously save you money .
Terrible just awful Wow Wow this guy sucks... I mean worst stand up I've ever heard. Don't waste your money .
I liked it's cotton, and the color also good. However it stays loosely, also it doesn't cover my chest, I need to wear something inside .
At first it looked promising. I read some reviews and it said it can hold at least a charge and a half, but after using it once to charge a phone that's 25%, it just stopped working. It did not even charge the phone to 100%. I clicked the power button but every time my screen would go on standby, the charger would turn off as well. I'm not sure if it's just out of charge already, but I know I just charged it before using. I'm disappointed really. I just wish I got a good use out of it. I'll try again and if it works better next time, I'll change the ratings .
I bought this when it was 249.99 bugs. It came really well packaged, intact, without scratches. The game is awsome totally as i expected and I can recommend it to you. The multiplayer gameplay for me is awful, its not like the common multiplayer from AC BH or AC lll its like RPG now. Nevertheless is a perfect gift or for personal use .
Price a little high, but well packaged, works 100%. Original as it says. I recommend this and not the other lower prized car adapters. This one you know it will work and its high quality .
Perfect. It came in a box, pretty cool cover, like 20 spaces for ps vita game cards, 2 spaces for memory cards. A ps vita carrier (in which the Vita DOES fit) plus this carrier has 4 game slots and it can be removed so you don't have to carry the whole case. Just awsome!! Totally recommend it .
It is exactly what I was looking for. The size is perfect for me. I bought it because I wanted a gym short. I really coudn't make my mind if i should buy M or L. I took the risk and bought it M. After all it was and is an awsome training short!! Totally recommended .
A little to graphic for me. I did not finish it. It was not for me but maybe someone else .
good product- looks good- feels flimsy, but on the positive side, it is relatively light- had to return mine b/c it started rattleling after approx 30 mins- will get replacement fan soon from amazon- hope it is not defective. recommned .
Dissatisfied with the material, did not use it, nor did i bother to go through the hassel of returning it. Do not recommend .
Does not work with my Ipad2- other than that- it would be very good product! Consider using other products- did not even bother returning .
Great product- fit good- not issues- great for running/walking- light- ewasy to clean- continue to come to this shoe beacuse of the comfort .
Do not buy- sorry to say very bad product- trashed it as soon as i opened the bag- this is truly &#34;you get what you pay for&#34 .
get what you pay for- use it at work- not too noisey- recommned for desk top use. perfect for a small cubicle .
There are LESS expensive (OVER $40 less) editions with the SAME functions/accessories- not as responsive as one would expect- would recomend to be able to see vids immidiately .
Sound not to good when you turn up the volume. over all not to bad for what I will be using it for .
The end of the attachment piece would not fit into the load slot intended, thus, I slid the attachment in from the end of the needle. I managed to get the first end through the button and material, However, you are forced to use the intended slot for the other end of the attachment piece; and, as I said the attachment end would not fit in the intended load slot.My wife tried to make it work, and she was as frustrated as I.Total waste of money,Gary Musselwhite .
As others have said, the mount is too small for any handlebar end.  You'll have to use a zip tie or something to mount it.  Then it will not bend to stay in position and when you bend it on a day when temps are below about 70 degrees they arm snaps off.  I had two of them and both of the arms snapped off.  Fwiw, you can buy this mirror all day long for less than $1.50 (including shipping from the junk capital China) on another on-line auction site .
Very little to no arch support.  If you need a flat piece of thin memory foam in the foot bed then this should work for you.It also is seems to irritate the outside edge of my foot between the heal and arch.  I don't understand what was the point in raising the outside rear edge but it doesn't seem natural.  Not worth paying more than $10 for this item .
I knew from reading all of the reviews that you need to order up one or two sizes in this shoe. I guess the China workers can't read or measure to get the sizing close at all.I normally wear a 11.5 to 12 or 46 so I went for the 48. They are a bit too big but I probably could make them work with a better insole. (I have no idea if the 47 would have been the better choice - but I'd say if you are only 11-11.5 and never a 12 then probably yes)The outsole on this shoes looks to be good but that is about the only thing I found to be of quality. Otherwise this shoe appears to be pretty low end to me. The insoles are removable but are of the very lowest quality. The uppers are thin and cheap material that doesn't look like it will hold up. They should "retail" for about $50 (To suggest $100 is simply ridicules)I would not have high expectations if you want to try this shoe. Mine will be returned .
It smells OK and doesn't linger anyway.  I can't tell if it is any better than any other snake oil products.  It can burn for a minute or two so don't over do it .
It will not work with your Linux systems so be alert to that.  I don't know about using Wine so you might could try that .
As everyone says these do not stay in the position that you try and bend it.  Then when you bend it again it snaps right off.  This happened to both of the mirrors and after the first one I was being extra careful.  These are junk products made in China and are worth next to nothing.  Get the Mirrycle mirror the first time around and you will be good to ride.  It is so much better and worth the few dollars more - save the aggravation .
The reviews on the balls were great so I purchased them for my 9 month old.  He hasn't quite taken to them yet, but I hope he will.Only negative is, once I saw these and ordered them and waited for them for three weeks, I then saw them in our local Toys R Us store .
These replacement spouts are a necessity.  As the spouts wear out quickly.  I loved the cup but found that the spouts do not last long, and none of the stores that sell the cups sell the replacement spouts.  Had I known this, or how quickly the spouts wore out, I may not have purchased the cup.  My son loves this cup however, and so rather than spend the full replacement of the cup every month or two, I found these online, ordered 6, and should be set up for awhile until he graduates to a new cup.  My only negative, is that I live in Canada, and these ship from the US and took over 3 weeks to arrive .
Autofocus isn't working!!! Only manual mode,  Do not buy on the internet because the lenses must be checked at purchase time, I was sad to return back there because of the departure to another country .
HELLO FELLOW CRAB OWNERS!Hermit crabs are awesome, fun, crazy pets. BUT there is a lot of information out there that is incorrect when it comes to their care needs. PLEASE PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS CAGE. I used this cage in my very early days of having hermit crabs, I then learned the hard way a lot of the things that hermit crabs need that this cage cannot provide. These are some of the things...1. Gravel is dangerous to hermit crabs, it can cause their legs to break or be damaged, also not suitable substrate for them to dig and molt in.2. hermit crabs need 3-6" of substrate to dig into and burry themselves in to molt successfully.3. there is not enough room in this cage to have all the items that a crab needs.a. salt water dishb. fresh (declorinated) water dishc. food dishd. room to climb and explore4. this cage cannot hold in heat or humidity, which is vital in keeping hermies alive. Crabs have gills, they need to be able to keep them moist at all times.This plastic tank could be good when you go pick up a hermit crab from the pet store and for the drive home, but this should never been the hermit crabs home! NEVER.ALSO, PLEASE DO NOT BUY PAINTED SHELLS FOR YOUR HERMIT CRABS -- THEY ARE TOXIC !!WWW.HERMIT-CRABS.COM is a great website, there is almost everything you need to know on this site alone,hermit crabs require a lot more than pet stores let on. but they are incredible pets, so if you have purchased ahermit crab for yourself or your child, please do some more research, it is not your fault that you have fallenfor the "hermit crabs only need water, pellet food, and a sponge" We all have to start somewhere. please do not let this steer you away from having hermit crabs because they are great pets, and once you put all the hard work into building a healthy crabitat and learning all the Do's and Don't(s) they are relatively easy to care for .
I got this for my 10 gallon tank for my hermit crabs, If i could go back and redo my choice I would go with something a little bit bigger/warmer. It kept my tank at a decent temperature, though my hermit crabs kept close to the side with the heater, they loved the hide out on the heated side, but it has helped my conditions for molting, I have had both my hermies molt since buying this. -- I now have a 20 gallon tank and larger heat pad. But beware, once you stick this on, you cannot take it off and move it. it is forever attached to my 10 gallon ISO tank.Not too bad of a buy, it works exactly how it should but I would advise a larger/warmer heat pad for your hermit crabs! Depending on tank size of course .

This product does not have the correct levels for your hermit crabs. These products are made to get a customers money and make the consumer believe their hermit crab is getting the correct care. It is much SAFER and CHEAPER to buy Instant Ocean Sea Salt and mix accordingly! please do not buy this because the price is cheap and there is a hermit crab picture on the front.www.hermit-crabs.com is a fantastic website for all hermit crab care and needs information.surf the internet for awhile to learn more about the things your hermie needs, if you know he/she needs salt water, you are on a great path! keep going!HAPPY CRABBING .
PLEASE DO NOT GIVE THIS TO YOUR HERMIT CRAB OR BUY PAINTED SHELL HERMIT CRABSpainted shells are TOXIC to your hermit crabs.over time the paint will start to chip off the shell and will stickto your hermit crabs gills. Also hermit crabs are scavengers, they willeat almost anything they come across. if they find pieces of paint theywill eat it. sometimes unintentionally while eating their real food.it is not safe for them.sometimes, poor hermit crabs are forced into painted shells while the paintis still wet, causing their bodies to dry to the shell, which will likely killthem.if your hermit crab has a painted shell, please offer him/her plenty ofnatural shells similar in size to what they have and hopefully they willchange into it! please throw away any shells that are painted and empty .
This kit is sort of okay. Your hermit crabs needs are much larger than this kit provides for. I do not think this kit is all bad though. but many factors play into it. two things that greatly affect this is the size of your crab and how many crabs you have.but from reading the other reviews on this item, you may want to buy this ONLY for a tiny hermit crab.BUTTHE SPONGE -- your hermit crabs needs more than a sponge for its water source. Your hermit crabs needs a salt water DISH and a fresh DE CHLORINATED water dish. The crab needs to be able to climb in the dish and soak its body and clean out its shells. if you have a few different sized hermit crabs, you want to have either a sponge or empty shells to help your little guys climb in and out. hermit crabs should not be able to submerge their entire body and shell under the water. So make sure you have a dish safe for both water types and sufficient bowls to do so. I personally have found that my hermies love the Zoo Med Reptile Ramp Bowl. It has worked the absolute best for mine. I have a 20 gallon tank, 4 hermit crabs, (2 medium, 2 tiny). I ordered the Medium bowl. It is perfect for my bigger guys, but I have extra shells in there to help my little ones get in and out if they find themselves to deep.  ALSO sponges need to be cleaned often, I personally do not use them because they stay moist and are an object that can easily start mold. if you decided to go with sponges, I would boil them every two weeks or so, and replace them often. I have not had sponges in my crabitat for months and my hermit crabs do not miss them. They love their bath way more!SAND-- from the other reviews, you may want to be aware that the bag being sent is smaller than advertised. but in general, you need WAY MORE sand than this kit provides. There should be enough sand for your biggest hermit to dig down and completely burry himself. Depending on your hermit crabs size, you need 3"-6" of sand/substrate. This is very important for your hermit to be able to complete the molting process. If your hermit cannot complete this process, chances are, they will die. I am not exaggerating, please do not learn the hard way on this. I personally do not buy sand from pet stores. Plain old Play sand from Lowes is suitable for your hermits. you will want to spray the sand daily to keep it moist so the hermit crabs can borrow and create a molting hole. Also, misting your tank and sand can keep the humidity up, also another vital factor in hermit crab care. if you care about the color of the sand, then spend the money on this stuff. but you will pay three times the amount on colored sand. I bought a 5 pound bag of play sand for 3.49 this weekend. I put the whole bag in my 20 gallon tank. when I had a 10 gallon tank I also used the whole bag!SHELL FOOD DISHES & PELLET FOOD-- you will want and need more than a little shell for a food dish. but that does not mean this item is useless. I like the shell food dishes to hide throughout the tank with treats on them. Hermit crabs love peanut butter, put a little on this and hide it somewhere, you crabs will love discovering it later. but don't forget where you hid it, you don't want mold!!!! you should have a larger food dish for the fruit and veggies (and occasionally meat) that your hermit crab needs. Pellet food should not be the hermits main diet. I always give fruit and veggies along with a little pellet food because some of my little hermies like it. so don't think you need to throw away the dish or pellet food, but they are not enough to sufficiently take care of your hermit crabs.TWO SHELLS -- two shells is nowhere near enough shells for your hermit crab. if you have one crab, he should have at least 5 shells to choose from !!!AT LEAST!! I have 2 medium hermit crabs and have 20 shells for them to choose from. the last thing you ever want to find is a dead hermit crab and the other one walking around in the dead crabs old home. it is rather disturbing. if there are plenty of shells, fights are less likely to happen. Don't get me wrong, sometimes there is plenty of shells and one crab will still want another ones shell. that's life I guess. but two shells is not enough, but two is better than none or one.CLIMBING WALL-- I had the same climbing wall before too. the two small strips of Velcro do not hold it that great. I had 5 pounds of sand in the tank that held the climbing wall tightly to the side of the tank. But, this wall attracts mold easily. it holds in moisture which is good for humidity but if you get mold, it will continue to grow on this wall. just be careful that no crabbies find their way to the back of the wall and that you change food often to avoid mold. if you have the correct amount of sand then this wall should stay into place, if not, the Velcro will not be enough.THE HIDEOUT -- as I said before, you may only want this if you have a little tiny hermit crab. I personally have two small hermit crabs and I have a small coco hut like this one. They love it. And truthfully, I often find my larger crabs smooshing themselves in it too. If your hide out is above sand, the big guys will dig down to be able to fit inside. Its funny to watch them try to get their shells through the door, but I think this hide out will be just fine for all sizes, unless my crabs are just weird and like small spaces. I have four hermit crabs and I have 4 hideouts. All different sizes. Because if you do have a tiny hermit crab, you want a hide out so small your big ones cannot get into it. the small crab needs somewhere to go is he or she feels unsafe or bullied. Normally crabs get along just fine, they love friends, but they have cranky days too. I wouldn't worry to much, if your crab wants in, he will find a way in.This kit is okay to supplement a tank or to HELP get you started. but your hermit crab needs much much much more. please do some research to find out what you are missing or just plain do not know. I started out with very little ideal of what hermit crabs need because I was fed the same myth of hermit crabs needing a sponge, a little sand, and pellet food. after much research and reading, I have learned a great deal.  please go to www.hermit-crabs.com if you want to know more, I have found this site helped me a lot, there is tons of info on there from basic care to being able to tell if your hermit is a boy or girl.HAPPY CRABBING EVERYONE .
HELLO FELLOW CRAB OWNERS!Hermit crabs are awesome, fun, crazy pets. BUT there is a lot of information out there that is incorrect when it comes to their care needs. PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS CAGE. I used this cage in my early days of having hermit crabs, I then learned the hard way a lot of the things that hermit crabs need that this cage cannot provide. These are some of the things...1. Metal is dangerous and toxic to hermit crabs, small exposure is okay but not as toys or part of their tank2. hermit crabs need 3-6" of substrate to dig into and burry themselves in to molt successfully.3. there is not enough room in this cage to have all the items that a crab needs.a. salt water dishb. fresh (declorinated) water dishc. food dishd. room to climb and explore4. this cage cannot hold in heat or humidity, which is vital in keeping hermies alive. Crabs have gills, they need to be able to keep them moist at all times.when I changed tanks, I kept this cage for "incase of an emergency" moments. If I am having an aggressive crab or crab fights, I COULD use this tank to have them calm down for a little bit or I have used this when I am deep cleaning my tank or when I moved I used this to transfer them (but I removed the water dish and metal climbing wall). Now that I have since upgraded twice, I do not use this because I have a ten gallon tank that I use to isolating an aggressive crab.  If you have 1-2 hermit crabs, I have found a 10 gallon tank works good, if you plan on having more, go bigger!ALSO, PLEASE DO NOT BUY PAINTED SHELLS FOR YOUR HERMIT CRABS -- THEY ARE TOXIC !!WWW.HERMIT-CRABS.COM is a great website, there is almost everything you need to know on this site alone,hermit crabs require a lot more than pet stores let on. but they are incredible pets, so if you have purchased ahermit crab for yourself or your child, please do some more research, it is not your fault that you have fallenfor the "hermit crabs only need water, pellet food, and a sponge" We all have to start somewhere. please do not let this steer you away from having hermit crabs because they are great pets, and once you put all the hard work into building a healthy crabitat and learning all the Do's and Don't(s) they are relatively easy to care for .

They say that there should be 5 gallons per hermit crab.Putting this tank at a one hermit crab home. If you have two tiny little hermies, this would be a good STARTER tank.I do not advise buying it though. I am sure the product is great, but it is not ideal for proper hermit crab care.It is rather cruel to have one lonely hermit crab. They love friends! But do not go out and buy 5 of them if you have not had a successful molting process. I have had many different habitats in the last 3 years for my hermit crabs. I started out in a metal (DO NOT USE FOR HERMIT CRABS, THEY ARE TOXIC) cage habitat then upgraded to another easily portable plastic/metal cage (once again no metal!) then upgraded to a 10 gallon but found that after I started adding the salt water dish, fresh (DE chlorinated) water dish, food DISHES, climbing items, 1 hide out per hermit crab that my 10 gallon tank seemed smaller and smaller. I have recently upgraded to a 20 gallon tank and so far so good, but still feels like I could have more room and easily fill it with more things for my hermies. until i have a place of my own, i will stick with a 20 gallon but hope to have a much bigger crabitat one day!If you plan on getting more hermit crabs for your little critter i highly advise a bigger tank or you will soon be spending more money on yet another tank. but this 5 gallon would not be the worst choice for your hermit crabs, but it is rather cruel. they need space!www.hermit-crabs.comis a fantastic site for any and all hermit crab information. check it out before you buy anything harmful for your hermit crab, they require much more than most people think .
This tank is a better option of a hermit crab habitat.There are many habitats on amazon (and the pet store) that are not suitable for hermit crabs.This ten gallon tank has enough to get you started.The size is good depending on how many hermit crabs you have and want in the future. There really should not be more than 2 hermit crabs in this tank. Three itty bitty guys would be okay in here for awhile.Pellet food is not a sufficient diet for hermit crabs so please do some research on food for hermit crabs (which is pretty anything, just avoid salt, butter and anything heavily seasoned). But adding the pellet food to other fruits and veggies is a good ideal!Also, I have read some places that the sand included in this set is not great for hermit crabs, I have used it, and cannot say I have had a crab die specifically from that, but I personally avoid it. PLUS that sand is outrages. I buy a 5lb bag of regular play sand for $3.59 and have put the whole bag into my 10 gallon tank. it is much cheaper than the sand at the pet store. your hermit crabs need 3-6" of substrate to successfully dig, burry, and molt.Last but not least, I cannot tell if this set includes a heat source but you will need a heat source and thermometer (with a humidity gauge). Hermit crabs require a temperature of AT LEAST 75 degrees at all times and a humidity level of 70-80%www.hermit-crabs.com is a great site for just about all questions you could have about hermit crabs .
I gave 4 stars because some one need to correct the problems of words not having spaces. For example: the words to see will have no space. Many times that it takes away from the story a little trying to finger out the words. Great story with many twists and turns. I enjoyed language of that time and some reference to believing in God. The person who talks about God is the person most would notbelieve to talk of God. This is just a little part of story but enjoyable part. Glad I read all the story .
The seeds came in fast and in nice package.The plants that were grown in a planter did not get flowers bigger than 1 to 1 1/2 inches. the plants were tall and had a lot of leaves. The ones planted in the ground did not grow at all. I've never had a problem growing from seeds but these did not do well .
I don't remember it the size of the flower was given but my that did grow the most was 10 were the size of my big thumb. Growing instructions were very incomplete .
1. Company name on package!2. Complete planting instructions, A must for all people who want the best from your seeds! Even had pictures on how to plant them.3. Even told you what happens in cooler (I think means cold) and warmer regionsWill not know if seeds will grow until summer 2014I did learn that putting package with seeds inside it into ref. for 3 weeks helps seed grow.Keep soil wet like directions said. I say it was worth itNot giving 5 stars until spring when they grow or not.500 Seeds, Somniferum Poppy "Double Mixed" (Papaver somniferum) Seeds By Seed Needs .
I didn't purchase these BUT I'VE learned that you should always put a metal spoon, fork or knife with it touching the bowl's glass bottom and side. Never but boiling water or whatever into cold glass container. I gave 3 stars NOT to change customers stars .
My husband had so much trouble with his that I didn't want to even try. I ended up having a friend putting it on my computer but it is working great and my computer is 12 years old.  My friend has also add memory and other things over the years. I didn't give it 5 stars because ot proublem my husband had with same one. Works great .
Hummingbird & Flowers - Etched Vinyl Stained Glass Film, Static Cling Window DecalDecal Shipping is way too much; almost $6.00 is ripping off customers.This should not cost over $3.00s if that. Send it first class and insurance four the least amount $30 I think.Take white computer paper to protect Hummingbird & Flowers - Etched Vinyl Stained Glass Film, Static Cling Window Decal, then with plastic bag cut to size and taped close put it all into home made envelope from 8x11.5 white computer paper or a reused envelope .
Yes, some needed a little paint touch up, mostly on the hair and cloths. I wish the eyes were not so black but I took a tooth pick and lighten them up. I make my own ornaments from these and I was happy to find them. Enjoyed all the anamals, Most sets don't have any .
Like I said it looks just like the picture but I'm not as happy with the picture as I thought I would be.It is made of very thick material and should last for a long time .
I would not want the earnings bigger but they are not over big. The necklace chain is long for me but I like it that way. The owl has a lot of  open spaces which lets the colors of your top show.  I'm not bending back the bent stem because I'm afraid it may brake. I wish the backing was bigger because I lost it right away. I will enjoy wearing them .
I cannot say anything bad about this bracelet. It was very impressive to see.  When I put the bracelet on it looked very expensive .
The story was very good but also very short. It should be free or  with a set of great short story's. Cost way too much for what you get. Not happy .
I have to say, this exceeded my expectations. I had to adjust all the straps and belt a bit to fit me, but I had no problem in doing so. It fits great and I'm 6'2 and 220 lbs. The accessories are right where you want them already installed onto the vest. The leg drop holster is great and accommodates a full size pistol even with a light and laser combo on it. I absolutely love this set up. Very well worth every penny and I was surprised that something this good is this affordable. THANK YOU .
I'm 6'2&#34; and 215 lbs. I got the jacket in size large and it fits great. Love the ITS feature and it's very lightweight. Not really anything like a winter jacket (of course winter in Alaska is a bit different than lower 48) but still great and can wear layers underneath .
Came unopened, even has seal on bottom of canister that says must remove  before use (good way to know it's not used). Not expired and won't expire until 2018 (unlike many other canisters here on amazon .
I bought these because I needed a place to store my motorcycle gear in my toy hauler.  I didn't want to put in heavy cabinets, so I tried these instead and am very happy with them.  I also mounted one in the kitchen area of my camper so I can hang my skillets, pots and pans, pot holders, etc....this way I don't have to keep putting them away in the cabinets while camping. Product is well built and should hold up well .
I've been a DJ for 8 years, played at a number of venues in Hollywood, I also do a lot of my mixing at home. I wish being a DJ was something I can do as a career but life isn't always the way you'd like it to be, nonetheless--I am passionate about EDM and still pump juicy 4step progressive/tech house in my home studio.Let's get one thing clear, the sony MDRV6/MDR7506 is always chosen over the XD-53 ONLY during my visit to studios and during my home studio, I will explain the reason for the choice and application.Both are accurate with tracking, great transparency, however--the sonys are more quick in timing, far more revealing in the lower-upper high frequency with a mid range that's just as close to perfect or ideal for mixing at home, preparing a set, producing and other applications in a studio environment, they have this wonderful sparkle. Another aspect that the sonys excel over the XD-53 is comfort, I don't think I need to elaborate the difference in comfort as everyone's head size/ear-to ear is different, but to give you an idea--an analogy would be a firm orange vs exotic Persian silk pillow.The 53's ace card is undoubtedly the reproduction in bass response. I'd like to note that these headphones have the largest drivers within the DJ headphone market. Additionally, these 53mm drivers are admirably hard to distort, I'm sure you can but at that level of volume you'd do more harm to yourself than get audio pleasure.I'd like to go into more detail about the bass. As loud and physically impactful these can get, they at no point--even with a much more complex track, do they bled into the other frequency or cloud the working elements of midrange and highs. The bass just hits gloriously hard in its own space and time allowing me to dissect and break down a track with ease and haste. The decay, quality, and it's accuracy at loud volumes makes these almost absolutely require in a club compared to other DJ phones. Again In a club, not at a home studio.By now, you can clearly see where the sony and the 53s are special in their own right. While I can use the 53s at home, I found the sonys to be a lot more enjoyable as well as having the edge in my studio. With electronic music, it's crucially important to listen to the snares, hi-hats,cymbals of the track you are cueing up to present it through your monitors and as important as bass is in that aspect, I believe the instruments I've mention are more important for a silky, grain-free, and harmonic blending and transition within the mix. But, I wouldn't use the sonys at a club, I'd have a hard time judging the bass of the cue track, this will cause me to turn up the headphone which would end up hurting my ears and a quicker fatiguing of the ear from its upper frequencies.So if you are a resident DJ every weekend at a club or would like to enjoy legendary bass that's clean, accurate with impactful enough to shake your vision( exaggerated, only the Audeze LCDs yield this type of godly bass ) mixing at home, then the XD-53 is obviously the choice. But if you are nit-picky and has to have brutally(in a good way)honest midrange and high frequency, the mdrV7 and 7506 will not disappoint, it gets the job done in spades.So basically, for me, I need both. Lol, sorry about your wallet. Cheers .
Ah, I remember this epic night. Sander threw a ridiculously long 6hr set, but it was Digweed that took the crown. The set that he played with Sasha was literally mind blowing. It was dark, urke, tech house. I honestly did not care about the fact that it was 97 degrees at 11PM that night. For anyone that went and remembers that night, it was an insanely hot that day .
I work as a smog check inspector in the state of California, in California there are more vehicles than there are of human beings. So depending on the station's service, price, etc the number of cars may vary. I for one, work at a shop that has a high volume of cars that come in per day, typically around 15-18 cars daily. Doing 15-18 smog checks on my own is quite a bit of work on the feet.My review directly reflects on the performance of these boots while on the job:Comfort - Prior to owning this particular Timberland work boots, Ive used Caterpillar, Bates, and Wolverine. I preferred Wolverines as they offered the 'Contour Welt' technology for great comfort, especially for long hours--I felt they were the most comfy of all. Im happy to say that these Timberland PRO work boot is far superior in terms of comfort and 'end of the day' results, I honestly thought boots cannot be anymore comfortable than what the Wolverine Buccaneer and Raider models offered. When I first slipped these on and tied the laces on both feet, it felt as if my feet were pillowed by some exotic Persian fabric and padding. These boots are ridiculously comfortable to wear, the best by far.Performance - Here again, prior to these, I felt that Wolverine outperformed the competition with their 'Multishox' feedback or energy return technology. But against these, there's just no comparison. Timberland's 'Anti-Fatigue' technology is like walking on cloud-nine, the energy returned or 'bounce' is amazing, it allows you to maneuver quickly, safely, and with grace without a hint of discomfort. Another excellent feature these boots have is their 'Electrical Hazard Protection', on their website it states that these boots meet ANSI Z41PT99, ASTM F2412-11, ASTM 2413-11 and F2892-11 standards to provide protection from open circuits. I do not know what all those actually mean, all I know and care about is the fact that I do not get shocked/static from touching any metal surface after going in and out of customers vehicles on a windy day. Don't you hate that, when you get in your vehicle, drive to a gas station to fill up, and you get a jolt of static electricity while closing the door? This happens because the shoes you are wearing are of rubber, a great static build up material as your shoes are touching the fabric floor mat. With these, I can work worry free of those deadly static shocks I used to get 100x a day, I can literally rub these boots on carpet for 10mins and touch you without shocking you! How awesome is that...This review has gotten longer than I wanted yet I can go on and on about how wonderful they are, but I wont, Ill let the product speak for itself. I highly recommend these boots, excellent value, and of course--buy with confidence with Amazon .
In my opinion, Digweed's material is tougher to actually 'understand' or 'feel' over what most International superstar DJs offer in terms of style/flavor. I always get the "who's that?" when I mention Digweed to someone who  claims to love EM, and it baffles my mind that they have no clue as to who he is and what he has accomplished. I believe they have a much better chance of understanding his style if they saw him live at a club and not at a rave or from a CD. Then again, not everybody enjoys the wildly dark and haunting progressive house this man possesses. But really, how can one not..?LIA is the lastest release from the "Live in" series yet it sets itself on another level. Live in London was good, really really good--prior to this I felt that the London release was Digweed's finest mix. However, with LIA there is absolutely nothing wrong with the entire 1-4 Discs. These 4 Discs are filled with real quality tracks that had me grinning, scratching my head and glued to my 5,000.00 headphone rig for the entire 4+hours. Its so properly done with his signature style of dark, tech, progressive house it is undoubtedly the best mix any DJ has ever created, possibly for the next 10 years. The track selection is simply a work of art and Im convinced that Mr.Digweed is not human but of something else.Digweed appears to always be at his prime but 2013 was particularly his year, releasing some of the finest albums, LIA being the best. For those of you who thought that "Live in London" was the best, be sure to audition this one--I'm sure you'll agree. You'll have a hard time deciding which of the 4 Discs you like best, every Disc envelopes you completely and differently.I originally wanted to purchase this album with Beatport in higher than MP3 quality but Beatport is seriously greedy with money. If you want the album in WAV format which is essentially 16/44 or CD quality, you'll be asked to pay an insulting price of 63.00. Obviously this album's value is more but you can order with Amazon which gets you a actual CD--all 4 Discs AND even a free MP3 version download. Shame on you Beatport, shame on you.. And Thank you Amazon .
Great book , when I bought it and read the first page I was in the zone and couldn't put down till the end .. I wish there was a sequel cause a lot of unanwsered questions but great book .
I ordered these stands because they were made by Ultimate and in the past they have latest a long time.  But by no means are these Ultimate worthy.  Several reasons...The bags they arrived in were covered in mold and gross.  The bags might last 2 gigs (if your lucky and baby them). I want to protect my gear.  Made from supper cheap material all around.  Secondly, the stand itself is weak.  With just a little weight the supports bow and twist. The threads are worthless and feel like they are on the verge of stripping.  Even if you tork all the clamps it slips down with little weight.  You have to use the safety pin because the clamp can't hold any weight unless you use cardboard speakers. Overal very disappointed and was seeking for something with much more of a standard.Don't buy these because the bag is simplify more of a inconvenience when it rips.Don't buy these if you want a sturdy speaker stand that will last.  They will fall apart .
Product fit withonly minor alterations needed to replace 1950's line which was rusted away. Would recommend to anyone who asked. Shipping faster than expected. Good company to deal with .
The picture of the this Toyota Camry wheel covers looks exactly like the ones originally came with my Camry. But when I received them, they are not quite the same in that the five holes for putting the nuts through are not holes, although I can still use one them for my missing. Very disappointing .
I honestly couldn't stop reading I love this series and the books just keep getting better! But how about a little more romance next time .
I bought four New.All are old.Even damaged.I have no way to use any of them.Is it cheating .This is a lesson for me .
As a technician, light under the hood is just as valuable if not some times more then tools that I use  when im doing my job. Great battery life. Handles my environments very well .
It looks good and all but when I put it on my phone it won't stay on. I find myself fixing the case a lot while its on my phone. I would return it but will just cost me more money to ship it back then what I payed for, not worth it .
I know that many foods we eat out of convenience aren't good for us. Have read so many diet books and none seemed right to me. Dee makes it so easy to understand what's really in the processed food we eat every day. I am making changes because of the book. Some things I removed from my diet immediately. I know it will take time to totally change my eating habits but this book is my healthy eating bible. I make notes and take them to the store with me. Thank you Dee! Can't wait until the cookbook is out .
I ordered my speaker a month and a half ago and still have nit got it. Who do I write to? I know something was going to go wrong cause it said there was not tracking number or info for it. Somebody tell me what to do about this. Thanks .
Proactive did not work as good as I thought it would for my face.It was cracked up to be this AMAZING product when for me it wasn't.However,  it wasn't ALL bad. My face did clear up a little bit. I wouldn't purchase it again though. I personally don't think it's worth the money...for me .
This is a plot intertwining novel. Interesting and I could not put it down, only to sleep. I recommend it highly .
Moves slowly in the beginning.A sleeper compared to The Wizard of Oz. My eyes wouldn't stay open. Unsurprisingly boring! A sleeper .
A great portrayal of an adult relationship between a mother and a son. Shows how minor events can live in hearts forever .
Good read!......worth the time hard to put down what more could I say can't wait to read the next one .
I love this app but the newest update on my kindle fire for it doesn't fit the screen completely anymore it is too big for my kindle.  Please fix .
Useless. Nothing more than a tv guide listing. I have the app on my S3 and I can watch shows and movies. This is the last straw for my kindle fire HD....going to trade it in for an android tablet .
I've been playing FV & FV2 both since they were first launched. Quit FV because it became too cumbersome. And now FV2 is on the same path. All the quests require help from others to complete.  I thought that the developers would make the mobile version a bit friendlier to entice people but they completely missed the mark.  Don't waste your time on this.  Play Hay Day instead .
Ive read all the reviews on this and I didn't encounter any problemsI have a Breckwell P22. everything lines up fine, only thing that I needed to change was thewiring connectors, Simple electronics. Cut the end that came with it. and attach corresponding bullet connectorsHad it installed in 30 min.Its running much better that the stock motor. (which was making a high pitched squeaking) .Best price I found .
This is great movie can't wait till season 4 comes out .... I would recommend that it is for the whole family to watch it my kids loved them to .
I loved this book from the moment I read the summary. Traci Bee keeps you on the edge of your. He takes you high and low. So low you wonder what will she do to keep this book going in your favor.....If you never read a book again make sure that this is the last one...but it won't be..10 stars .
No matter how I follow instructions to move piles, they do not move, and then you lose game after game.  Wish I hadn't wasted money or time on it .
I do not know how James Patterson keeps coming up with wonderful and exciting story plots that keep me on the edge of my seat over and over again.  Love Alex Cross and care about him and his family, great writing and suspense .
I had read two of the Deadwood Mystery books and when I saw a short story available I was excited.  It was okay but not what I had expected .
Still reading, but have found some excellent information.Not sure if I would recommend it just yet.Need to try some of the suggestions on how to help my memory .
We bought this for our 6 month old daughter and were not pleased when we got it so my wife got on here and wrote a nasty review but the folks at BDDistributers did refund our money and our our shipping costs. They did offer to replace the item with what we were supposed to get but we were frustrated and went with the refund. I'm sure this is a great item to have .
Bought for a friend and she loves it. She could not find one in local store. She is a Looney tunes freak .
I Loved it until it randomly broke on me while I was trying to adjust it. wtf. The LED lights don't work either but other than THAT it was fine .
The heat isn't hot enough but it works great .
my phone is not work, so i want to change a new one; the white is very beautiful, i like it very much; i will recommend it to my girl friend .
i like to use pen to record my life, but i can't find it in local Wal-Mart; so i buy it from amazon online, i like it very much; i will recommend it to my  friend .
Never saw it coming. It shows that priests can be in conflict with themselves. Enjoyed the suspense. I want to read more books of this author .
I have a 42 inch vizio monitor and this game purchased from Gamehouse Website and Amazon does not fit the screen correctly when put on full screen--the screen is bigger than the monitor .
I bought the book for class and every page had answers written in it, i also found loose papers in it that were not apart of the book its as if they didn't even look through the book to check its condition .
As to the content of the movies themselves, we will never know. The discs would not play properly so watching the movies is nigh impossible .
I truly LOVE Facebook!! I keep up with family and friends thru Facebook. I LOVE the pictures and all of the day to day happenings that you would never know without it .
I liked the storyline. I could not put it down. I stayed up way to late reading this. Good story .
my eye lashes are not long at all , but mary kay love lash mascara make them look longerthan they are. I love mary kay love lash mascara .
This is a book which has endured for years.It is the best verb book I have encountered.I'm not too happy with the kindle version and will buy the hard copy .
I need a hard copy. I just can't get a flow reading on the kindle.It has been a disappointment .
This is the first foreign language dictionary I have know to just do one way translationsMight suit some people but not me .
Within 24 hours, the stitching on the top that holds the cell phone in the case broke.  I sewed it back together as I didn't want to mess with a return.  A few days later, the stitching that holds the credit cards, tore.  The wallet cell phone cases for my type of phone are limited so this was my only option.  I guess you get what you pay for .
I really love this flat iron so far so good I mean it's very very cute and the box is two now for the shipping it was excellent let me tell you it took 3 days to get to me now I order something else from another seller and I actually ordered it before this and I recieved this item first so yes I do recommend this seller they get your package out to you asap not to mention the other thing I ordered was first class !!! So yea I love the flat iron and how fast it came oh one more thing I wish it did have a heat setting they do get hot they definitely work great on African American hair and weave .
Excellent product. I have tried many weight loss products from raspberry ketones, green coffee extract and everything else under the sun. A friend recommended this product, as it was inexpensive I decided to give it a try. I have a thyroid condition which makes losing weight hard. After a month of using it I lost weight and a significant amount of inches. I wish I had measured myself before, but with all the other products I had tried I figured this would be a failure also. On another note one this project was far the best because it helped reduce my hunger cravings. After I finished the bottle I was at the health food store and came across another product and the label looked the same so I decided to give it a try. FAILURE! I am now going back to ARX Fast Weight Loss Pills (Extra Strength) because simply it works. Of course it's not a magic pill and you still have to eat right and exercise, but it sure has helped me. I would recommend this product to anyone that looking for a healthy, all natural, weight loss supplement .
I'm still pregnant so I haven't got to use it yet but hopefully it holds up and stays together well. I guess it's a little on the expensive side for a pacifier but it was giraffe and I couldn't pass it up .
haven't used it yet but its in the baby's room, setup, it's beautiful. Very soft.. My cat seems to like it .
Birthday gift for grandson--huge success! He cannot wait for colder weather; he's wearing it around the house because he likes it so much. Good quality and great price .
I ran with this shirt several times. It dries really quick and it's pleasant on the skin (not like other dry fits).Thought the hand holes are a bit weird.Really good value for the price .
These said that they could be used in mountains. That is incorrect. They couldn't even be heard a mile a way much less fifty feet .
cool, it is not exactly what i had in mind but it works and fits anyways, good quality as well .
Great unit- Does an excellent job removing moisture from our double wide mobile home located in humid Florida. I  would have no trouble recommending this unit .
I was pretty excited to get the shirt when I saw it online, so my enjoyment of the product is a little biased. It's a nice enough shirt, looks good. Don't buy it though, I don't need a bunch of people wearin the same shirt as me .
What a read!Summer is definitely taking one for all the ladies around the world, to open up and let everybody know that it is normal to do all those crazy things!Thank you.Can not wait for the next one .
I was bit disappointing with this purchase because the laptop did not bootup when I tried to boot it for the first time after I received it.I then took it to service store where it was found that the motherboard has issues. Service engineer changed the motherboard but then later it had display driver issues.I had to take it to service store multiple times within 15 days of purchase;I rather would not recommend this laptop/purchase option to anyone .
This product has not done what I intended for it to do. I still have the same spots I had before using it. Any answers as to what might work for me .
Suelo ser&eacute; benevolente en las cr&iacute;ticas con los libros que leo, pero en eta oportunidad tengo que decir que este libr&oacute; es verdaderamente malo. No ense&ntilde;a absolutamente nada valioso.  Afortunadamente es bien barato y corto, de manera que no perd&iacute;, ni mucho dinero, ni tiempo .
Beter than expected. Highly recommended for kids as well as adults. For kids keep in mind this is not a toy. It is the real deal.I love tis train set and look forward to expanding it over time.Lionel Trains Polar Express Train Set - O Gauge .
Right out of the box the quality of this HDTV set is simply amazing. Not only is the picture simply amazing , the design and look of the TV is quite nice. It was a breeze to set up. This is a deal that should not be missed. I would gladly recommend this purchase to family and friends anytime .
I was worried these boots would not be as attractive as I was hoping, but they were even cuter than portrayed online! I love them. They are perfect winter boots. Stylish, durable and warm. One of my favorite things is that you can easily rinse them off if they get muddy. My only critiques are that they are super stiff at first. So stiff they are hard to walk in and heavy so that they hurt your ankles. When I am walking it feels like I am stomping around. It takes some getting used to it. They are also a bit difficult to drive in. The first time I wore them I wore ankle socks with them, and they rubbed the back of my ankle and almost gave me a blister. Now I wear leg warmers and rain boot liners with them and it is no longer a problem and even more stylish. They are warm and toasty, but almost too toasty. I wore them when it was 50 degrees and they were too warm, and my feet are always cold. They are hard to get off, but it gets easier every time. I think once I have them all broken in they will be just fine. I never want to take them off. They are very adorable boots. Perfect with skinny jeans or tights and a dress. I plan to wear them forever. I am obsessed with boots. I have many pairs, but these are my favorite. I don't know if I will ever take another pair out of the closet. Worth the money, especially since I found them $72 cheaper than retail price! Thanks amazon .
Could not watch 20 minutes of this film. It is so cheesy. The plot is so unbelievable and the acting is poor. A waste of money .
this book kept me on edge.i could not put it down.i love all of Johansen's books.Her style of writing is easy to follow and she does not switch her characters around so much that you lose the storyline .
as all johansen books this one kept up a fast pace reading.never boring.she has a style of writing that keeps you reading .
i got an excellant product for my grandson.he is really enjoying it. he did not need any help in working the Kindel he just started going thru the functions .
They still don't show images of a person clear had to put two in one room in order to get blind spots in the classroom .
Hello... i want my game only by ps3... cause i don't wanna get the wrong product.. thank for the hel .
The speaker works well--however it converts back to being a normal &#34;blue-tooth&#34; where you speak who you want to call.  I can't get the contact list to properly download and be stored in the memory. It does memorize your most recent calls and puts them in as your &#34;Favorite Contacts&#34;. I have tried with various Android phones and none seem to work. The battery seems to last a good amount of time. Love that it turns itself off/on when you get in and out of the car. Can also easily be converted back to phone if you don't want it to be on the speaker.  Although it doesn't come with a house charger--your cell phone charger works as well with it so it doesn't have to be charged in the car. The British accent auto voice distorts some of the names to be non-recognizable but once you know who they are referring to it isn't an issue .
Great hat. Nice embroidery. Wish the hat was adjustable. Although it was a &#34;Small/Medium&#34;-it was really more of a &#34;Medium&#34; size. My nephew loved it but it is too big (which he will grow into it). Perhaps you may think about offering &#34;older youth&#34; sizes in hats--not just toddlers .
It wasn't new, I thought it was new. It had some scratches. And some keys you have to press them real hard or else they won't work .
My first purchase of this product was 28 years ago that was recommended for my 2 year old son by his  physician. He was having constant upper respiratory infections, including bronchitis since he was born. Esberitox made him stronger, and build his immune system in no time for life.That's why I still remember this Barand Name and was happy to recommned it to my friend with a small child with similar problems....... and she is loving it !!!!She couldn't thank me me enough, now she spreads the good word to other young mothers.No wonder Esberitox is on the market for over 80 years.Elizabeth .
These are the only generic controllers i ever bought for my ps3. I gave them a chance after hearing about them from a co worker. And i am very pleased with them. They  are responsive and comfortable to hold. Often i find myself reaching for this over my wireless Dualshock. If you have controllers and want to round out your numbers, or just need new ones this is a pretty good one to go with. I have had them for a few months now, with no problems as of yet. {No button sticking, no buttons going out} For the price and quality. They are a steal for me. Keep in mind these are not wireless. That's the only downside i can think of, but that really depends on who's using them., I'm so used to wireless that i keep forgetting they they are not wireless. I often jump up with them still in my hand, yanking them straight out of the ps3. So yeah... Will pick up a couple of extra's just in case .
I had never played any Disgaea game before, Mostly all the guys i game with wants to either shoot you in the back, or smash you into a wall and speed off. I never actually heard of Disgaea until this year (and that's only because of Amazon recommending it to me) I like all types of games not just one in particular. So i'm not stuck in any one genre of gaming. What made me buy this game was 3 things. The first thing was  from the photos on amazon i saw. It made me think of FF tactics gameplay. And it's very similar to that, but with it's own style and variations. Will a fan of FF tactics like this game,I'm leaning more towards maybe, but not necessarily. This game is good on it's simple humor, but sometimes the humor can be a bit of a turnoff for those looking for a deeper more serious storyline. While everything that tries to be funny in game, isn't always funny, i did have a few simple laughs and a smile or two here and there. While being amusing, It's simply just not for everyone, but no game is you know. The second reason was that i looked up a video of it on youtube,  It showed  some of the special moves, team attacks and, the character creation screens, and that made me go, ...kay may be something to this game. You have a huge class of guys to choose from.Magic types, Brawler types, types in between and things that are just crazy. They are all demons or related to demons in one way or another. The third and final reason that i went with this game was because of it's reviews. But let me warn the graphic seekers out there. The sprites here do look great , but it isn't anything that will blow your mind. Now if you don't like turn based tactical rpg's, you won't like this game at all. It would be a complete waste of your time and money, but mostly, your money. Because you wouldn't play this long at all. But if you like any tactics styled rpg game, then you'll have a good time here with Valvatorez and his crew of misfits .
While this is a great gun for Time Crisis RS it's not  GOOD for every rail gun shooter. Works great on time crisis razing storm and Dead Storm pirates but very unresponsive on Time Crisis 4. The same goes for the house of the dead, works great on hod 4 but on hod 3 and overkill it isn't able to keep up with manual trigger fire. It does it's best when it's played on games that have auto fire, which requires you to pull and hold the trigger once to keep firing.It's a great gun with that considered. It has a very nice feel to it, and feels durable and well made. I have a move sharpshooter too, and this gives  a good change of pace for some fun pistol action .
When the first BlazBlue came out, it was a great game. It had a lot going for it. Even with a somewhat small roster of characters. It actually had a good story, which is hard to come by in a lot of fighting games. But it's not really about the story, it's about finding a favorite character, and beating down anyone or anything that gets in your way on or offline. But now after playing this third installment, i'm getting a bit tired of the whole blazblue universe. on the good side of things you get all dlc characters from continuum shift and an art book of pictures from the first blazblue. And they changed the system voice again, and man, that's a bad thing, You can download better voices for 6 bucks online. Which is bs. Gameplay wise it's great and graphic wise it is good looking like always. If you never played blazblue before, and you like 2d fighting games you'll love this. If you have played blazblue before, you'll more then likely love this. But for me, it's not the same excitement as when i first played the original blazblue. The story has become a bit tiresome and it's time for me to move on past future releases. But for fans of blazblue you'll love this one .
This thing was a steal considering how much it cost normally. Had it for several weeks now and haven't experienced any trouble with it so far. No loss of data or corrupted data. It gave my psp new life. As far as downloads and music goes. Really happy with this one .
I read you can use this for the slim super slim and fat boy ps3. I used it for the slim and it really gave me the space i needed. I have over sixty movies, 300 songs,70 games and 15 downloaded games from psn and i still have over 200 gb left. This thing is nice. Only problem is, like with any hardrive. Is it going to last or is it going to be a dud. Only time will tell i guess. I just hope it will last. All that downloading was a pain. And i just can't go through that again .
Does NOT stay on Jawbone! Waste of time and $$! Doesn't FIT!!! Keeps popping off within seconds of putting it on!  Very Disappointed .
I'm impressed. For four dollars and change I had no idea what would be coming in the mail. But boy was I excited when it arrived. I can't tell if it's a bootleg or just a factory reject. The tags seem legit enough. Either way it's well put together and super cute. Totally worth the money. I think I'll be getting the other Eevelutions for friends. :D .
Was wrong one, it fit an iPhone 4 not the 4s. Can't afford the spare money right now to order another either .
I was very disappointed in this product. Although it did arrive on scheduled date, it did not work! And it was suppose to be a Birthday gift .
Did not work when arrived and was totally upset over it bc it was a birthday gift, will border from them again .
Wasn't pleased with these at all. They only worked for a week and quit. Wouldn't recommend for anyone to b .
Did not work when arrived.  I was very upset over this and didn't have the spare money to order another one .
I ordered 2 pairs of Pintoli compression socks. The first pair was nude ultra sheer.I think the ultra sheer are a little less tight on your legs. I wish the color was a little more tan but under slacks it's not to big a deal. The second pair was comfy compression socks in black and they were a little tighter. I have never worn compression socks before but after a short time I got used to them being tighter on my legs. I am very happy with my purchase and I will order more in the near future .
Works well for video games, nice sleek interface, the sound sucks but hey for 75.00 you can't beat that throw some headphones on then..........overall this tablet is a good purchase .
I was suppose to receive this item today, &#34;GARANTEED&#34; but it didn't arrive. I am writing this product review now because I won't have the chance to write it in my country. I really depended on this mp3, i was going to listen to music in the plane as i will be going and when its time for me to workout. Just to warn you guys, if your going to take this mp, make sure to order it from a century earlier, please do not listen to there 'lamy flamy garanteed!' .
I ordered the Chromebox via pre-order...never got it...gave up...ordered again on Tiger Direct...never got it.  Re-ordered on Amazon...skabloooosh got it!  I love it! The experience with Chrome is so light, fast and anger free.  I think the word &#34;nimble&#34; sums it up.  It's fast and capable.  Immediate gratification machine .
Fun game but should have more ways than spending money (real money) to earn some items. But you can play with outstanding just can't build as much .
I have skin issues for many years.  I was diagnosed with Dermographia in 1960 and Morphea in 1999 so I have been dealing with skin issues for a very long time.  My skin is very active at this time of the year, especially my feet, ankles and also my back.  I ordered the cream and started using it right away along with a prescribed med which doesn't really help when my skin is active.  The cream did help with the itching and I would order the cream again.  My only recourse when I am this active, along with a cream, is to go to my dermatologist and get a steriod shot.  This usually helps to calm the skin down until another episode .
It is an awesome story line and I enjoyed the book so, so much. It was a very good follow up on Bared to You. Cannot wait for the follow up - just a pity I have to wait to next year :-(Reflected in You: A Crossfire Novel .
Stone, how can you write a book about Bezos if you never interviewed him? Bezos needs to write his own book .
These forward controls look great on my 2012 HD 883. Very easy to install. I did not run into any problems. I highly recommend. I heard that the product will not work on a 2-1 exhaust so be careful if you have a 2-1 exhaust. Great product and great seller .
These bulbs look great but they are a bit dimmer than regular incandescent bulbs. The only reason I didn't give it 4 stars is because 1 out of the 3 bulbs I ordered didn't work.However, I emailed customer service and they sent out 2 free bulbs to replace the faulty one .
This speaker is perfect for someone who is always on the go and is compact enough that you can bring it just about anywhere. Wish I had spent a few more bucks for the blue tooth version so I didn't have to hassle with the cord .
I bought this case because I wanted a something slim and stylish that would still protect my phone. While it looked great online, the blue case was more of a purple and my screen shattered the first time I dropped it. Not only did I end up having to replace my screen, I also had to buy a new cover that would actually protect my phone.Don't waste your money, there are better cases out there for the same price .
no problem very goot bueno gut  sehr gut muy bien exelent vino aleman.tell me so many worts for what, when everything is perfect .
i was in a hurry and  i had tu make the wine ,there fore i did not complain !!i will not aquaire an other most from the same sorse!  i have photos of the box,broken .
The best sounding exhaust EVER.  Got here in time. no complaints. I did research and it paid off with this one .
For the price you can't beet it versus the pitbull brand that are 2x the price for one lift. i .
Verrrrrrry bad quality, do not buy, it is not as advertised , picture shows as if it is wrapped , totally different .
We got the machine only although the price mentioned was to include all what been stated but unfortunately it did not, i sent email to Venola and waiting for explanationWe should never trust chinese deliveries, this due to many fraud advertisements takes place that  happened to me when i tried to buy many stuff and my friends too , no quality in whatever they sell , and not honest too .
First copyrighted in 1958, Elie Wiesel's Nobel Peace Prize winning novel "Night" is all about the Holocaust and his experiences. The book includes the accepted speech by Wiesel and a new preface by the author. The author's intention of writing the book was clearly to inform the people of today of his experiences and the reality of the holocaust while the New York Times calls the novel "A slim volume of terrifying power."Night starts out in Sighet, Transylvania where the author talks about his family and a foreign Jew called Moishe the Beadle, who taught Wiesel all about Kabbalah. Moishe, along with the other foreigners, get expelled from Sighet and are taken to Hungary to dig trenches that are later used as their own graves. Moishe amazingly survives, escapes, and is able to make his way back home to Sighet. Later, in 1944 Wiesel was taken from his home to Auschwitz, then to Buna, to finally be taken to Buchenwald. There, at sixteen, Wiesel lost his father to Dysentery and later fell ill himself. He had already lost his mother and younger sister, Tzipora, and was now alone. With no reason to keep living, Wiesel miraculously survived.Night is the perfect example of a true heart-wrenching story with a first person view to get the reader feeling as if they were really there. All throughout "Night" you will see many themes displayed, however keeping faith would be a major one. During the holocaust many Jewish faiths were tested; is there a God? Is there not a God? The author's overall thesis would be reminding people of the true horrors of the holocaust. Wiesel describes his very own horror stories throughout the novel with "From the depths of the mirror, a corpse was contemplating me" (Wiesel, 115) and other chilling metaphors.If you would love a true inside look on the Holocaust, "Night" is the perfect book for you. Though it lacks very much description, the author uses plenty of unique similes and metaphors to keep the writing alive. A great example of one the similes the Wiesel uses is "Monday went by like a small summer cloud, like a dream in the first hours of dawn." The author also puts true feeling into his writing and thoroughly explains each point in the Holocaust.Along with the Nobel Peace Prize, Wiesel has also won the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the United States of America Congressional Gold Medal, and the French Legion of Honor. He is also the Andrew W. Mellon Professor in the Humanities and University Professor at Boston University. Elie Wiesel is the author of more than forty other novels including "Dawn" and "Day" to complete the "Night" trilogy. You can find all three of these books at Amazon.com for $12.07, or at Barnes and Noble you can find "Night" at $8.98 for paperback and $15.14 for hardcover. You can also find it on your NOOK for $7.99 or on your Kindle for $4.99. "Night" is also available for audio-cover at $14.39 .
What do i have to say that hasn't been said about this album, well i'll tell you: blew me AWAY!! This is a must buy for fans of the king of pop.  Track listing:  1. Don't Stop Till You Get Enough  2. Rock With You  3. Working Day And Night  4. Get On The Floor  5. Off The Wall  6. Girlfriend  7. She's Out Of My Life  8. I Can't Help It  9. It's The Falling In Love  10. Burn This Disco Out .
I was happy when Capitol resently remastered The Beach Boys early albums, but when I got the new Surfin USA remaster I thought that the Mono would be sharp and clear, but instead it was like they took it (The Mono) from the 1990 cd! On the other hand the stereo is full of life and delivers crisp, clear sound. If you are just getting into The Beach Boys, this is the one to start with .
The only reason why i do not like it is because it broke about 2 days later and wouldn't shoot anymore instead made a high pitched loud buzzing noise! BUT it still looks really cool .
it looks cool but the straight magazine runs out of ammo and the dual mag. is a pain in te butt to turn the thing on the bottom because it doesn't move all of them over .
i chose this rating because the first i opened the package all but 3 of the batteries for the flashlight (shotgun) and laser sight (rifle) where crusty and unable to work also i was missing 1 battery. Secound the pistols silencer aims down and not straight. Thirdly and the worst part is that when i charged the battery for the rifle it stopped working and will not work at all now and i don't know why because it worked somewhat well before i tried to charge it.Also be sure that if you send someone else this be sure to give extra brand new batteries because that is BULL .
The mat is not as sticky as a yoga mat should be. I slide out of poses. At this point I hope this will improve with use.I wanted a longer mat and that's what I got, just wish I had not ordered 2 .
I chose five star because this book has suspense, excitement, thrill and romance.  There wasn't one thing I dislike about this book .
Cool movie! Thinking about taking a road trip, just not in the direction of that town. Then again...I just might .
I don't have much to say accept it a classic and I would watch it again later much much later .
didn't see it wanted to but I rented it and forgot I had this one maybe next time if there is  a next time .
Can't go wrong with this one...or can you. Maybe next week I'll buy something a little more of a sleeper like Would You Rather. Can't believe I want to see this purchase again. This time I'm NOT paying .
This wasn't what I thought it was going to be, but it was very interesting.(Maybe it was the eye candy .
cool beats just a cool beat and that's it don't dance so it aint that just like the beat and that's it .
I needed an upgrade and got one not going to say much else nice beat jay-z cool and that's it .
I know Brianna and she really likes this one not to mention every girl out there probably so I said why not me too .

Just another day not much else to do so I watched it and got shocked by this one. Don't forget to turn out the lights .
busta bus just killed it how do ya pass this one up it might be easy but not by much .
This movie isn't what I am used to seeing but, given the content it was interesting. Not one gun shot when off, nobody got beat up, but it was still intense .
thought it was katty perry but its someboby else don't know where she came from but its not all bad .
saw on tv and thought she had a nice voice I was shaving at the time and didn't know she was white(DAMN .
I've never seen a movie that had me on the edge of my seat in the first 30 mins. but this one did.(ACTION .
Not a big fan but this one liked a lot. Not hatin' on the girl the but she got some skills .
Nothing is better than a good movie and nothing is better than a thriller...watch it unless you like being bored to death .
Can't say it wasn't the kind of movie that wouldn't have you on the edge of your seat.(What a RUSH .
This case is crap and was already falling apart when my wife took it out of the box.  The beads where not really even glued on .
Parts did not look as good at the pics and didn't fit right.  Plus didnt come with any instructions to install .
The delivery was not speedy, but the books were sealed and in great condition (Wonderful books by the way).  If you like these books, you might also get Tales Of Beedle The Bard .
I still haven't gotten my product yet and it's been over a month since ordered.  It was supposed to be here a week ago .
JUST CHEAPLY MADE, YOU CAN TELL IT WAS WHITE AND DIED BLACK,.DOESNT SNAP RIGHT TO THE PHONE. CANT GET CHARGER IN SPOT WHEN CASE IS ON .
I ONLY HATE IT BECAUSE I OREDRED IT BEFORE XMAS AND ITS STILL NOT HERE. WHAT THE HECK, ITS ONLY STICKERS .
It has issues working on my kindle fire. Return to menu and other features don't work. It could be a fun game with a bit of tuning. Its worth trying .
I still have a cold tire balace issue. I was expecting this to remedy tbe issue. I computer spin balace the tires every few months. They are aftermarket whees and oem bridgestones. With these wheels there isn't a cosmetic place to dynamic balance. Stick on weighs tend to come off my wheels. Once spin balaced they are perfect for a few months. I hoped that these beads would cure my issues. They do not. I don not have a tire issue. They might be great for you. But i am not impressed with my purchase .
Blindfolds are colorful and served the purpose of gaming blind folds.  Blind folds were not very expensive and shipped quickly .
good quality.  Nice and bright pattern.  Not a bad price.  Better than anything I could find in the big stores .
have a very old mirro pressure cooker.  the original gasket was hard and getting brittle-thought I was not going to be able to find a replacement.  this one worked great - no issues with sealing .
easy to use.  nice truck features.  large screen a plus.  I use the truck route feature often and really like the speed warning feature.  the calculator function is handy too.  Had an electrical issue with unit malfunctioning (damaged screen) causing random things to activate and not work.  Rand McNally took care of the issue and fixed the unit quickly.  Very happy with their service .
dresses up the &#34;old phone nicely.  Does not fit the best - the holes in the top for headphone attachment do not align very well and it is hard to plug the cord in.  Also it is VERY hard to lock the phone using the top button on the phone with the case on.  price was cheap though .
best part of this sweatshirt is the lightweight material.  Not bulky like most.  the &#34;girly&#34; stripes inside the hood is maybe the only thing that is not very manly......but overall a guy will still like it .

this peacock outfit is just what I expected! the fit is great. I bought a medium I'm a size 6-8 and it fits a lil snug but is gla attesting in all the right places. the feathers are gorgeous. I can't wait to wear it next weekend &#128525 .
It was n is what is in the description. I didn't realize the rhinestones (if you may) would fade. They were gray n now are black n I've only had it for about a month. Nothing has fallen off n it came on expected date. Looks good on a white phone but way prettier on a black phone .
This item arrived on time. The person i bought it for loved it. The item was what it says it was and no problems with the order .
Excellent as always.  I have been using Norton since around 2003 and I have never had a major computer infection .
Fantastic design, well made, and really works well.  I am surprised you cannot find them in malls and such.  A great product at a great price .
It is perfect for my intended use of dust control . No messing around with remote controls and it is reasonably priced .
Don't ever buy this game the graphics suck and the story line sucks d*ck.Also not to mention if you die you have to start over from the beggining like the start menu and you can't skip anything.Also you are level one and the enemies are all level 20 no matter what and you instantly die and fleeing gets you killed quicker .
It's okay game and thanks to the cheats the game isn't half bad.Although the experience definitely needs more work example being the camera view.Also even with the cheats you still have to unlock the other thing the hard way .
Up there with the best naruto games I've ever played still haven't beat the story so the game is a little time consuming but worth it.(got it for christmas .
I liked it but you might not.Although there are some parts tha get tiring example being the super strong enemies that there's no way you can beat .
got it fast. tag was cool as s*** the shirt feels nice to the touch. surprisingly cool in the day the dark color gets a little warm but every dark shirt does but i believe this one handles the heat better all in all its definitely worth the money. i can't wait to more ENDO shirts .
I'm really surprised I'm the first to review this book on Amazon. This is a truly great collection of sci-fi esque/fantasy short stories by the author. Most (if not all) of the stories are highly original, and really do what all good sci-fi is supposed to do 'make you think and imagine of the possibilities contained within and your own life'.I wish this book was available in digital format, as I'd buy it right now and sit down to hours of enjoyment. It's been many years since I've read it, but this collection left an indelible ongoing memory that I never shook, nor ever wanted to.Four of the nine stories were voted for the Nebula award.I highly recommend it to anyone, and damn it, will someone please make it available digitally .
I first read this book about twenty years ago and I still remember it fondly. In fact, I actually liked it so much I read it three times at various times throughout my life.Every one wants pro's and con's, but I honestly have no 'cons' in regard to this book. If you like time travel based sci-fi in any form, then I can almost guarantee you'll love this book.As to the other reviewer who said they read this book in a day, I would simply assume they read everybook in a day. It's not a short book at all, unless you compare it to 'Dune' maybe, but otherwise it's a meaty book that will keep you thinking as you read it. Then again, I like to savor good books on the journey reading them, and this was one of them.Well worth the time for any time travel fan .
Well, I wouldn't normally read this kind of story (ya, I know that's probably what they all say,) but I saw Miss Kitts name on it, so I knew it would be at least a good read. What I didn't expect though, was to actually LOVE this hot story! Like I said, perhaps it's not my thing, but after today... well, let's just say I may read more of it! I was engrossed after the first page, totally into it. The author writes in a way I can only say will touch you in 'all' the right places ('velvet sleeve'... wonderful.) It has a great build up, and I couldn't wait for... you know... 'that' scene, and it didn't disappoint! Ohh la la! Well worth it in my view .
The lead character in this story, Tracy, is a waitress. But she's not your usual 'billionaire fodder' that just throws herself at a rich man. Having been in an accident, she develops the ability to enter the hot billionaire's dreams, and she finds the real reason why he never stays with just one woman. He needs something, but Tracy is 'the only one' who knows what that is, and she cleverly uses this to her advantage, so they both end up with the passion and relationship they want!I'm glad to see a story with a female character who isn't completely stupid for a change. It gets old reading about girls who just fall over themselves when they get a little attention from a handsome and muscular billionaire. I liked the way the author made Tracy into a dominant force. In fact, there is a great deal of power-play between the two of them, so it's not like this is just a 'dominant female' kind of story. It is a VERT HOT story, and by that I mean the author definietly knows what the reader is looking for (and I certainly found it!)I'd recommend this to anyone looking for a really steamy read, and a great twist in billionaire erotic romance books .
I'm used to reading erotic romance that is just quite 'meh', I've gotten so used to it that when I actually come across something written like this, it really kind of excites me. The descriptions of the characters and situations are so detailed that I felt pulled into their world. The main character is mysterious and sexy (look out for the descriptions of his hot body!) and everything flows well, and the sex scenes I LOVED!The main characater Sarah is also quite intriguing, and there is a lot of depth to her. I mean, she's been obsessed with this guy for so long, yet had never dared speak to him, but when he rescues her, well, there's so just so much more to him that she finds out. I don't like to be spoon-fed when I read a book, I like the author to credit me with at least enough intelligence to be able to use my own mind and not have to spell everything out for me, and this author definitely does that, and does it well!In short, it's well worth your time and I'll be looking forward to seeing what happens next. Great read, Hot hot hot .
The story begins with Cameron Seacrest, a woman who has just hit her thirtieth birthday; and although a successful owner of a nightclub, she has realized she is missing one thing: A child. Putting out an ad for the perfect donor - realizing she may not meet Mr. Right anytime soon - she sets up a meeting with a smoky blue-grey eyed hunk called Sam.The author sets up the meeting and the characters really well, with a great perspective from the males point of view and Camerons point of view. Usually, most authors fail to do one or the other with skill, depending on their sex. But not in this case. There's also a lot of humor and some great sexy moments (before the other 'sexy' moments, I'm sure you know what I mean.) There are also smatterings of rich tension throught the story, which is great, not to mention a fair few twists and turns along the way that kept me involved right up to the end. In short, this is well worth your time. It's so much better than what I had expected, and I'll definitely be reading much more of Miss Towers work .
I picked this book up on a whim, never having read any of the authors work before, and was more than pleasantly surprised! It's the story of Ethan (he's the hot one!) and Cat, a girl who's father has recently died. This story has a really good back story going on, and it's not just one of those that you know exactly what's going to happen (I mean, there are certain 'things' you definitely know will happen, and do, quite a few times!) The descriptions of Ethan just make him to die for, and the author really brings everyone to life so you feel they are right there with you... which is a good thing with tall handsome cowboys, if you ask me. This isn't a short work either, so you get into the whole setting and really get to know the characters. I didn't regret this impulse purchase at all, and in fact, will be reading much more of this authors work in the future .
Other reviewers have mentioned the plotline, so what I'd rather talk about is the way the author writes. It's very descriptive, and you get  whole sense of time, place and the characters. I liked the whole atmosphere the author was able to conjure up. The contrast between the city girl and the rugged cowboy is also nice (and sexy!) With the beautiful scenery the author paints so well, it's hard not to imagine yourself doing the same as the lead female character (and when you read the descriptions of the settings and testosterone filled Cowboy, you'll know what I mean!)The passion is undeniable, and if you want a hot steamy escapist read, then this is probably the one for you! A well deserved five stars .
This is THE best BBQ sauce!  It is made with REAL sugar, not high fructose corn syrup, which damages your body!  Simple recipe with great taste!. Thank you Garland Jack's .
I figured out too late why my kindle would not add to cart. Thought I would share. You have to go into your account and enable one click purchasing. Hope it helps .
It is a very good case and nicely made. I just find it extremely hard to get off. I have been trying for two days now I cannot seem to succeed. That's the only downside to this case .
Price is excellent and I am waiting this product to arrive on time.It is toi replace my Universal Remote not working for WD6275 TV .
These slippers are terrible to walk in without socks! Good lord, I tried them on for the first time this morning to walk my dog, and I was in pain the whole walk. When I came home, I felt as if I had just finished walking across a bed of searing hot needles. I even felt as if my feet were emitting smoke. It was like a lingering heat was in my feet even hours after I walked the dog. These sandals are a huge no-no for people who don't like to wear socks with their sandals .
I purchased this because it's compact & you can use the jar as a cup.I also travel and use this in my room.Not big and bulky, this is good for any one that travels & uses a blender for making B0fast or lunch .
i give this product 3 stars  just  because it has good ingredients. but anyways it doesn't work for me at all. I have no idea how many times should i apply it  to work .
the only thing why i put 4 stars is that it's not my size. I like bigger and fuller. But anyways this small cici can give you a lot of pleasure. This is my first toy. I thought that it will not work for me, but it works. I had an amazing orgazm. I like the material. it is very soft. And it's not noisy. I would recommend it to every girl or women, because it works =) But if it will be twise bigger that would be awesome for me .
I absolutely love this CPU. Haven't had a problem with it. Its really fast and I really like that. Comes stock at 4.0GHz which is pretty fast. I would recommend this CPU to anyone building a PC .
The recipes are delicious.  It has exceeded all my expectations.  Never thought I would enjoy being vegan this much.  I would recommend purchasing this book to whomever inquires .
Enjoyed this book sooooo much but was a bit annoyed that it didn't have any others out yet. But will keep an eye on this one so I can continue to follow.Well written and easy as to follow along.Addictive, but great .
This book was really different to read. I wasn't really sure what was going on in the beginning because everyone was so crazy about marriage and stuff like that so I thought maybe it was set in a slightly different outlook on our life?Other than that I found the story really cool and enjoyed all the pranks.  Found myself smiling while reading it.A good book but just abit hard to understand at the beginning. Would recommend to Adults (above 23) anyone younger would most likely not enjoy this .
Enjoyed the light heartiness of this book. easy to read. Not overly funny but will have you smiling or laughing in places.Nice book to read .
I was really un sure about purchasing this book. The title and the blurb don't really give much away.Which is good in some sence but also bad because I think its under selling itself.This IS a great read and I will read it again when I can't remember how it goes but that may be in a few years becauseit is a memorable book and storyline.So its about a kick arse chickie who goes around saving &#34;lost girls&#34; but she is much more than just your average jo.  Shes a superhero known as the Angel!Recommend to anyone who wants to start reading a series and cant find a good one. This one is for you!Teen/adult para-normal romance and adventure .
I was so caught up in the book from reading the sample that I had to have it! And let me tell you it is worth every penny.I loved this so much and the characters where just so ALIVE!The romance in this book won't be for everyone but if you like reading things that are a little out of the square boxyou will enjoy this.So easy to read, and I at first you hate the main male character but then you cant help but fall for him.THIS BOOK IS TO EASY TO LOVE .
addicted! so so addicted!!!The final in the series of this book.  So great! move over Harry Potter I've found a better world to live in!So interesting to read and follow as it all slowly unfolds.I do recommend that you start at the beginning otherwise it may be a little confusing but Michelle Warren just recap at the beginning of every book so if your smart you may be able to follow along.I felt the love in this book was amazing and heart breaking at the same time.The story itself is just amazing with a great strong female lead character named Seraphine.The story is out of the world as its all about time traveling or wandering as the put it in the book.anyway I will keep this short. I LOVED IT! and didn't want it to end but sadly it did .
I didn't enjoy this and I think the reason behind that was because it was from a male perspective.  Not to say I haven't read other ones with a lead male but yeah I just didn't enjoy it.  I think he was just to much of a dick to fall in love with .
Wonderful read! Really enjoyed it! But comes up a little short is the romance department.Its not that there isn't romance in it just I feel that it should be a little bit more and has you feeling a little empty because of it.But there is plenty of other things going on so maybe you won't notice it as much as I did or maybe your not so much of a romantic like myself.  Will leave you hooked and buy the next book so you can follow along.Easy loveable characters that feel very real to you.  Easy to get caught up in .
This book is very addictive and had be hooked right from the beginning.  I very much enjoyed how it was written and the great storyline.So easy to follow and great because its a series.This book has everything in it, and the romance in it makes my heart beat faster and sometime hurt.  I don't think there will be anybody out there that would not enjoy this.  Add its a great price .
Couldn't wait to follow this series. Enjoyed the uniqueness of this book. will keep following this series.So easy to follow the story and easy to understand the different world.Great for another addicted to reading and stuck looking for a great book.YOU WILL ENJOY .
I enjoyed this book but I think the chickie needs to be more bad ass I mean if she can't jump out a 3 story window before she even knows its a shifter but some how cant manage to get some vampire ass I feel disappointed.I'm hoping she will super kick arse in the next book.  (fingers crossed)Well written and the story does flow nicely.  Not predicable but addictive.(so just fix Tessa so shes not a wimp .
Wow!I loved this right from the beginning! The sample had me hooked and I had to buy it!The story is super sweet, with a lovely friendship romance that could lead to more if Adam didn't have a stupid girlfriend! Who's not really that much of a girlfriend!Didn't really like how this one ended but I can except it. I just would have liked a little it more at the end.The romance is cute and believable. Its not rushed and it unfolds smoothly .
enjoyed this so much and I recommend to anyone and everyone BUT did NOT enjoy the ending.  I think that part should be re-written.  But the story is great and well really open your eyes as to how some people view the world.  I think this would do great in schools for kids to read but a good read for adults to. So many laughing out loud parts and lots of quiet chuckles to yourself .
I enjoyed the humor and teasing in this book. Very well written, easy to follow and not to much description, which i always find can be a big buzz kill when someone over describes something.  Lots of conversation and laugh out loud moments.  Would read again and follow Tara Brown as a writter after reading this .
SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO GOOD!This was a book I wish I could have continued to read while I was sleeping!The story is so different and that's what I love the most about it.The world that Tara Brown as created in writing this book is amazing and very extraordinary.I CAN NOT wait for the second book of this.The romance is the classic girl can't choose between to awesome sexy guys. I say she should have them both!With a lovely strong female character and two sexy smart men in this book what more could you want?Well how about a city that is MENT to be the last city of men were everyone in the city can not remember what they did yesterday?still want more? how about remembering someone you aren't ment to? which could lead you to being 'dangerous'?Trust me you will love it and will be waiting for the next book just like me .
I don't think I would ever say this BUT way way way to many sex scenes.  In the end I felt skipping over them and then when I was just over half way I gave up.So I don't really know how it ends but yeah I think I could probably guess. I got up to the first real date with the limo and everything then yeah.. decided I could guess the ending well enough.But written well and did enjoy it but just got bored and tired of all the sex scenes .
So worth my time and cash to buy this book and read.  Really worth it with a great storyline that had be following it religiouslyAnyone who loves a kick arse female main character that doesn't play by anyone rules but her own.  I love that she's a cold hearted killer and I love her little triangle romance that she finds herself in.Its great that you don't have to read the 4 short stories that tell you about her background some more and how she ends up in the predicament in the first place.  You don't have to read them first because I didn't and I was still easily able to follow but I found myself wanting to no more of her story so I did end up reading them anyway .
OH man I loved this book! Everyone should read this! BUT be prepared to be left hanging at the end of it :(I loved how the Megan thought she was in love ever thou she didn't no the person she was in love with.GOOD to teenagers and young adults.(no sex in it)  Was a great romance and I could have easily continued to read this .
An interesting story all about how life can change in the blink of a eye.(or stopping to buy carrots for dinner)Had me slightly hooked but I will say that I didn't really didn't enjoy the way it was written.  I felt it wasn't very smooth reading but I loved the story behind it .
I love love loved this book so much I recommended it to so many people! I think that a lot of people will enjoy this of all ages. My 16 year old sister read it after I recommended it to her and she loved it. I read it and I'm 25.One of the best romance books I've read all year!No one will be disappointed if they decide to buy this book.  So worth it I had to buy it as a hard cover book also ( as the other is on my kindle)Its great because its no predictable and the storyline has you hooked right from the beginning till the very end.Easy to read and follow but has you guessing as to what is actually going on in the bigger picture. So well written .
Sad ending so sad that I could not carry on with the series. But I did enjoy it will I read it.Great for anyone looking at getting into reading superhero books .
Love all the series of these books, I can't get enough! Only down side to these I would say is they aint long enough, I wish they were like 800 pages, haha this book is jam packed full of funny like comments and one liners! REALLY REALLY must read it. Well written and just the right amount of decription verses conversation. Would easily say Eva is one of my top authors! Please keep writting .
I NEED THE NEXT ONE!!!As you can tell I am now addicted to this young assassin series.  Very enjoyable storyline from my now favourite writer April Brookshire!A rather lengthy book which I LOVED!worth buying and taking the time to read.An amazing strong female lead character with the classic fall in love on the job, job.The romance felt very real and the whole story was easy to follow but I didn't find it all that predictable.A real sense of family while reading this book and in the end gives your heart that little  happy feeling you get when your well..happy .
Everyone loves hero's!I really relly liked this story, I think it had the right amount of time before switching to the next character.Well written and easy smooth flow.The scene's are described really well and I felt like I was watching a super hero movie.But I no that the next one changes characters from these 3 which is really disappointing because i like these characters the best.Recommend to anyone who likes superhero's but be warned the next one is not so great .
So great!!!!I was in love with this book right from the beginning.If I had to compare it to other books Id say its Hunger games meets Divergent!So well written and easy to follow, and I love the creativity of this book! I am so glad its a series as ONE book just wouldn't be enough for me!  And I was lucky enough to start this series when all of the books were already out! YAY ME!I recommend to all young adult and even older adults to .
Semi light hearted romance about a summer romance that turns out will last threw not only just summer but the rest of the sessions to IF there wasn't a really large obstacle in the way.  LIKE finding out you summer romance love is now your TEACHER!I always enjoy reading books like this .
Always enjoy Eve's books. Well written, great story. Awesome characters and a good storyline. Longer story than i expected as Eve usually has short stories. Felt the ending wasn't the best. To easy and not enough drama or fun .
Really enjoyed the different spin on this, I love  stronge femal character and you can't beat this one. Thanks for not letting me down with this book Eva.  A book everyone will enjoy, more story but lots of romance and comedy .
The romance was a little slow in the first one and it is still alittle slow in this one too but I enjoyed it more in this one.It felt more real in this book.So well written and easy to follow.I don't think you should have had to read the first book to be able to follow this one.  It quite simple and has the re-cap at the start and all threw out if you forgot anything and didn't read it as a continued series like I did.( one straight after the other)I loved this story and I know you will to.Light romance but heaps of adventure so I recommend to all ages .
to hard to fall in love with which was easy with the rest of this series.  Bit disappointed.  To slow to the story and just gave up reading it in the end. Understood what was happening but just found it lacking.  I didn't feel it was real, it didn't come alive like the others had.  Sorry Eve, not at all the best in the 'freakn shifters' series .
Oh man this story is so amazing to follow and journey with the main characters.I was hooked and now I'm hooked-er-er (?) hahaSmooth flow between the books and a good recap if your memory isn't the best. But not over done if your memory is good. hahaI love the outside thinking in this book. Lots of cool things that I don't think anyone has ever thought up before. Like the mind tunnels! Genius! You rock Trisha LeighDon't umm and rrr about this book or its series. BUY BUY BUY!Recommend to any para-normal reader and to teens as its only light romance .
Enjoyed this different romance style. Worth reading.  Good book for on the couch.  Story is very funny and at times even had me blushing.  really felt like I was in this book. Please read will NOT disappoint .
This book was written well and okay to read.Story was a little lacking to me. I didn't understand the last half of this book with its sadness.People like to read about people beating 'fate' so I don't really understand why this is written this way.To sad and not the good sad. Made me want to stop reading because it was just depressing.The love and romance was believable if anything a little stiff.With having a strong female lead you would think that she would do anything to save her husband to be, even with the grantee of having 10 years of happiness and beautiful children and someone to love after he's gone. I would still not marry him.I kept thinking she would 'ghost' her way out of it but she doesn't and she just excepts what I feel is defeat .
To short and didn't enjoy the way it ended. But enjoyed the book still but would recommend the author rethink the ending .
i love this world and the imagination put into creating it. WOULD recommend to young teens 16 and up.  Not so bad for people over 20 either if your looking for something not heavy with 'romance' sences.  Ive also read the next book in this series and it also has not disappointed me.  The love and heartache is strong in this book and very hard to put down.  strong main characters .
disappointing and uninteresting. I really don't like this whole series and regret purchasing this book.the story sounds great when you read the blurb but its really not.:(the writing style is really not the type that I enjoy. but im sure that there is other who will like this book.WONT recommend .
love this. Can't wait to read more of this series.  really well written and easy to follow and get caught up in. HARD to put down, man me want to be able to read in my sleep .
SO good to read! Had me laughing at all the uncomfortable parts and the banter is great!If I didn't know any better I would think this really did happen...maybe it did! lolReally well written and you will find the book in your hand all day till you finish it!So make sure you have dinner organized and the house clean before you start. HAHAHA..Recommend to anyone who loves a fun heart in you hand romance but not to teens under 17.YOU WILL LOVE IT .
A great start to a rather large series.Easy to read,follow and fall into.I felt I had gods watching over me for a little bit.... kind of freaky.I love a kick arse women who doesn't let a man hold her down.FIGHT, FIGHT, FIGHT!Loveable characters that will leave you looking for the second book .
I thought this book was okay but I think a few things should have been different that could have made it a great book. I enjoyed the sexy twin struggle to fight over Kayla.  Wish she kind of wanted both of them.  The love in this book gets a bit sicking at times. But you love it always because no matter what they end up doing to each other (Kayla and Caden).Recommend  to anyone who is looking to a sweet romance with a lot of fighting .
this is worth reading to anyone who is thinking about purchasing this book please do! you will not be disappointed with this book and its even better because its a series! I always tell my friends and family to read these books.  I love that its different and full of not just shifters but other things that go bump in the night.  story is easy to follow and to easy to be pulled into reading all the time. full of laughs and great romance.  Thank you Helen for this great series of books .
Start with the first book!this is a great series and I can easily see it  being made into a movie which I would love to be in...(hahahaha)So loveable and easy to read and well just plain love.  Recommend to anyone as there is no sex in it but their is a lot of romance in it.I love this world that Helen harper created and its so easy to imagine everything she describes to you, and she doesn't over describe either which I find some author do.  Lot of laugh out load moments aswell as fist pumping in excitement time too.YOU will enjoy these 5 books in the series there is no question about it.Fantasy readers will love this the most as its a different take on magic/ were/ elf world .
Really enjoyed the dark side of this book it had me hooked write away or well close to the start anyhow. I didn't like the beginning with the boyfriend I felt that could have been skipped and started right one the holiday.Well written and was a joy to read.  Q is so hotttttt!!!!!GREAT story for all adults looking for a real dark lobe story .
WOW!Okay, I a totally in love with this story! and I'm a 25 yr old mum!(hahaha)So well written and easy to fall and be trapped in. Couldn't put down and I found myself wishing I could develop a way to read in my sleep.After reading this book I know I will read anything else Leigh Ann writes.I story is so great to read and is filled with laughs and love and tears.Recommend to anyone who likes to read a teen romance but doesn't like to much of the &#34;teen&#34; part in a story.I recommended this to both of my sisters and my mother .
I liked a lot of things about this book!  I liked that it wasn't predictable and I felt that the romance was real.Quite a few moments I found myself cursing out loud because of something that happened (most likely a great one liner put down)BUT I did feel there was a bit to much fighting in this book.  But I Loved the characters and all of their relationships .
another great book in this series.  I've always enjoyed this series and I don't think I've been disappoint at all.recommend to people who like series that don't follow the same characters around that whole time.  Characters from the other books appear in this one and its great!You really should start at the beginning if you wish to get into this series but if your smart enough you will be able to follow the story line as they always recap all the way threw for those of us who are forgetful.Jam packed with romance and adventure and laughs .
A great lil twist at the end!So much romance you with be blown away!...........Really well written and by gosh you will love how it all plays out.It will have you feeling happy at the end and full of love.I would defiantly read more of Alyssa Rose Ivy's books because of reading this one.Wasn't to exciting in the middle but enough that you just have to find out who she picks or ends up with.Recommend to anyone who enjoys romance .
So lovable!I recommend to anyone and everyone who loves romance real life books.Such a great story about a great lovable silent man who is so easy to fall in love with it made me want to go out and learn sign language!I always enjoy books with two males who are interested in the lead female and I was happy to see she had a smart mind and was a good judge of character straight off.  So SO easy to read and you will NOT be putting it down anytime soon so make sure you have all the important things done before you sit down to read!YOU WILL LOVE IT .
I enjoyed this book and I feel in love with the character really easily.Written well and so easy to follow along in their lives and the way they are thinking.Told from the male caveman's point of view and I usually find it hard to relate to.( I'm a women) But this was told so well and I really left connected to Ehd.  Beautiful ending even as I felt that my heart was breaking. ( be prepared for the water works)I wasn't totally in love with the way that it was explained at the very end how "Beh" came to be in the past but the whole book is so lovable that I can over look it.Very Full book. Beautiful tale about true love.recommend for the mature and anyone who loves a good cry!HUGS! and "Khizz's .
Wasn't reAlly surprized by this book except for how dark it is.  The storyline is great and has you hooked And reading it all straight away.  At first I thought she wasn't going to kill them but I'm glad she does, well only one so far.  Oh the book should make men everywhere a little more afraid of women. The length the Julie or aka Sammi is willing to go to,to get revenge is Amazing!Worth atleast 4stars but a lil disappointed at the size of this book .
Okay so I thought I new what was going to happen then the book was all like BAM! No you don't!Easy to follow but a big BIG twist at the end. I mean come on Brandon knows how to play the game!poor Katie had no chance..One thing I didn't like about the series tho was all the flashbacks Katie did. So annoying! I think it should have just been a book about the relationship before and have the second one  about 7 years later. I think that would have made more sense Ana would have been less hassle for us readersBut all that aside, this is still a great series and storyline. Recommend to anyone looking for a  short story romance that will have you reading faster then you' be ever read before. Enjoy! I know I did .
The story line sounds amazing! and it would have been if it wasn't filled with mindless chatter.Really annoyed me with all the inner dialog she does.  It takes away from the story itself and leaves you feeling disconnected to the character and story.I liked all of the characters and the story but have to skip lots of pages due to stupid chatter.Thank god it was free otherwise I might have thrown a fit.Has the making of a fantastic book! I mean come on! The daughter (who's a virgin) comes home  to her mother and boyfriend &#34;gettin it on.&#34;PRICELESS! I won't spoil the only best parts for you but yeah.. if you can over look the crap that's been filled in her and actually read the story, you'll love it .
A nice romantic novel.  Has the old love hate romance, which I always love.The female in this story is loveable and exciting to watch as she handles different situations.Male lead, is sexy and closed off and great to watch as he tries to fight his feelings for her.Good to read if you are looking for a cute medium sized story.  As it won't take long to read if you are addicted to reading.Recommend to teens and young adults and anyone who's young at heart .
The first time I saw this I really didn't think much of it. but I keep seeing it so I gave it a chance and Im glad I did!A really great romance between a master and his beautiful yet understated apprentice.  So loveable and I would easily re read this book. its dark and amazing and addictive!Easy to follow and fall for head over heals for.Recommend to anyone who like supernatural books.  I think an older person would enjoy this as I think its more for mature audience with the story line .
Can't wait to continue reading this series, I love a strong female character and this one is one kick arse b*tch .
enjoying reading this. easy to follow and keep up with. story line is fantastic and I can't wait to read the next one, hopefully Lizzy will stay with the same characters.  LOVE a strong main female character. I hate it when they make females blubbering messes.  Just the right amount of romance.  would read again and I;ll be keeping my eye out for the rest of this series .
Another short story. Sigh. Can H.M. Ward not write a full book?I liked the idea behind the story but I felt that H.M. Ward purposely desides that this book is only going to be 110 pages and then tries to jam everything you need to know in those pages but without telling you the good stuff.It didn't feel like it was 110 pages but more like 80.(I read on my kindle)Don't read if you don't like cliff hanger endings (more like slight hill ending)Over all I'm disappointed :(WRITE a Full book for god sake, I don't care that you think its your thing to ONLY write short stories all about that same story .
Only one in the series that I enjoyed. got the sample for all the others but they didn't catch my eye. easy to read and you really feel like its you in the world.  Im glad you dont have to have read the other books in order to understand this book .
This is actually the second time ive read this book and i finally gotten around to writing a review for it..Love love love the story line. So romantic and just plain loveable! I enjoy the fact that its not all love dove-e right from the beginning.Only flaw is it needs to be longer!!! But i still love it anyway .
I liked this book. But i felt the romance was unbelievable. I didn't feel a connection to the &#34; love&#34; or to the characters. Nice story line though and an interesting idea. Female lead needs to be stronger, i dont like that she's so blind to everything.Thanks for the read tho i did enjoy it but it just needs to be fixed a little to make the characters emotions feel real. Its great for the price being free and everything .
didn't like this book so much.  I understood it, but felt a lil let down.  didnt enjoy the story line .
I first started reading r.l.mathewson's neighbour from hell series and fell in love and this book right here proves why it was a good choice to fall in love with r.l.mathewson's books.Cute, loveable, exciting and sexy. So easy to get caught up in the storyline sand not want to put it down. No one will be disappointed reading any of these books .
my only complant is these books aren't long enough because I can very put it down so i mow through all Eva's books really quick. WORTH the price .
Enjoyable read. I like the different style or reading. Felt the love between the two main characters was a little dry. But good for a free read. Won't be following this series tho but i recommend to read as its free and good .
Eve Langlais you continue to blow my mind in your great books! I love you worlds!I am so in love with this world Eve has created and was a bit disappointed to find that there isn't a second book already out!But GOOD THINKS TAKE TIME and I'm very much willing to wait for the next.I did find the sample on this rather boring but I'm glad I brought it because it was a unexpected surprize.Well written and I enjoyed the spin on this 'type' of vampire world people always try to create for us.I love that our main character is a hard arse bi*ch and very strong minded.  I always fall in love with strong female characters and this character is no different.The love story is great to! It is a bit like a vampire modern day version of Romeo and Juliet if there ever was one.If you don't like stories that leave at a cliff hanger ending then this book may not be for you.Perfect for anyone who lobes Eve Langlais .
I read this all the way threw and I did enjoy it. But I felt a little disappointed with the price for what I read.This is a first book is a large series but im sad to say I won't be continuing to read the rest.Easy nice book to read with a great strong female lead.Easy to follow and understand .
Oh man I loved this book!Really well written and I was so hooked. I felt the romance and relationships were real.So well written. Defiantly a guilty pleasure but, the best kind!I great full story for a great price, NO disappointments.Recommend for adults, NOT a teen romance book .
I really enjoyed this book, its well written and easy to follow. I love the characters and especially love the main female character! She is super bad ass and lovely at the same time. She strong and doesn't hold back and that fantatstic! CAN NOT wait for the next one in this series.  Would recommend to anyone who is looking for a book they cant put down and has a strong female lead.  AND a great price .
very addictive and good for teens and adults. Lots of papers but will still have you finishing in no time as it is so addictive. you will continue with this series because you won't be able to help yourself.easy to follow and to fall into this worth L.H. Cosway has created for us .
I really enjoyed this book and wanted the second one straight away but sadly it wasn't out yet :(Well keep an eye out to follow this series.Great storyline and easy to follow but not predictable. recommend to anyone who enjoys Fantasy books. All ages .
A great first start to the series!After reading this book I really wanted to continue with this series. I enjoyed the twist of a old tale and found myself loving it more than the movies.  Its a little dark look at the way wonderland actually is, and how it all works which they don't go into at all in the movies.I love the romance that the mad hatter has with his Alice and the heartache that he had/has.Very easy to read. LOVE IT .
Had me thinking like a vampire while I was reading this. Great read. The world was so easy to see and fall in love with.  A bit of heartache and a bit of love but not very sappy for those of you looking for a romance novel.  Maybe could have done with a little bit more love in it. Easy to understand and I recommend to start at the beginning of this series otherwise you will be rather lost.Adventure story is great and the way that vampires could exist is great and rather believable.Thanks for the great read Steve Perlow .
enjoyed these but way WAY WAY to short, not sure if its worth the money but now im addicted and need to find out what happens.  don't buy if your not willing to pay for 4 books all real short. its written well but just not enough for what u pay .
Don't let the cover fool you! this is a really surprizing-lee great book.  Well written and easy to fall in love with and get caught up in the story.  Worth reading .
I feel like I've read a hundred books just like this one. Come on people think outside the box!I did however enjoy this but I wasn't overly excited about it .
This book is JAM packed full of Chad Leito's imagination! So awesome to see this world in the way it is described. Will blow you away while you are reading.I would compare this to Harry Potter but a twisted cruel version. But so, so, so great!In great awe at the time that is put in this book to make it so you feel like you are following but you still cannot see the full picture.Very cool .
I enjoyed it but its way to short and that makes is un-enjoyable.  Please Please PLEASE make a FULL book with a full story.Not reading any more of this because it was way to over priced even if it just have the makings of a great storyline.BOOOOO .
I enjoyed that this was a diffent consept with the whole were- hedge hog.  Easy to read and follow. well written and paints a great picture in ur head.  didn't enjoy that he got turned into a tiny-wee hedgehog. I would have liked him to turn into a giant hedge hog or have poisionous spikes. Other than that i really enjoyed his bad boy ways.  would re-read .
The storyline from the blurb had me hooked then I started reading it and just..couldn't really follow..I think the story needs to be a little more simple and to the point. Im sure a lot of time has been put into this book but its just to much..To much that I couldn't enjoy the story. Sorry I was really looking forward to reading this.Great idea thou .
I enjoyed this book almost to much. AND I think everyone else will to. =)Don't read if you aren't okay or into man on man.Storyline is great and I wish this book was a series. Sadly I don't think it is.Easy to read and follow. Book comes alive in your mind so easily .
MOST FAVIOURATE of ALL Eva's books ever! i hope Eva continues to write more books like this one. Comedy is fantatstic in this one, this book will not disappoint .
Not really sure about this book...But it still has me addicted.. I have to know what happens next. The story reAlly pulls u in. And even tho i don't like that fact they she lets some guy she doesn't really know come into her room( i guess some people are stupid like that) i still enjoy both the story and characters.addictive so watch urself .
Didn't really like the book, easy to read and Im not fussed that ive read it but i felt like it was missing something .
I'm addicted to this book.  Could not put down and have already pre ordered the next one.  This book hurt my heart to read when it was sad and made me laugh when things were good. So well written but a little confusing at the beginning.  Please take the time to buy this book as you will not be disappointed .
I did read this all the way threw but may have been out of my age limit ( 25yrs)I found it was to cutize and didn't feel very real but I didn't have trouble reading it all the way threw.NOT a bad story just to young for me .
Okay so there's abit of French in here but its not to much. ohkay so its like one or two sentences..Anyways...The blurb had me hooked on this story. I enjoyed that its not something that ive read before with the wheelchair thing.But that's what made me LOVE it. Not predictable and you can really feel the love in this novel.And a great price!I will be looking out for more of Annabelle Costa's books from now on.Recommend to anyone who loves a under-dog winning the prize. True happiness .
I enjoyed this but it just jumps all over the place and that's really rather annoying and feel like this story isn't about the demon Elise. So really the Ascension series is just a further along story of the Cain chronicles.I did like the story but for the love of god leave Rylie and seth and Ab  out of it!  Make up some new characters .
Story was good and I really enjoyed that side of things. Felt a little rushed with the whole story but great otherwise.I decided not to carry on reading the series as I personally felt it was a little expensive and not really worth the time.I think I would have LOVED this book and story if it were a FULL story.Well written and easy to follow and I did really feel the love and heartache in the book.I am still glad I read it and Im sure other who enjoy short series book will enjoy this book to .
I loved all of these books but tis was my least favourite out of the 3.I'm sure I won't be the only one who's upset with the ending of this book. Sure is was Okay but it left me feeling disappointed and let down.It was well written like all the others but once I put it down I found it hard to pick up again.  But I did and Im glad that I finished it.Just wishing for a different ending...Please tell me I'm not the only one?! I think Arianna kinda deserves to have both men.Recommend to anyone who enjoys super natural books .
Couldn't put down and read them all with in a day.  So great to read!Such a wurl wind story.  Full of vampire and elves.Bit of a messed up romance story but really great ending that is actually really surprizing .
I enjoyed it but I didn't feel like I was really there.Was a good book and story but that's about it .
to hard to follow and didn't enjoy how it was written or how the story goes. would not even try to read this .
This book was a tab bit slow to begin with and I wasn't sure if I liked or hated  the main female character (Rinda). But she grows on you and just like people in the story you start to understand her and like her.I loved how different this story was. and I hadn't known it was a fairy tale ( or not that I could remember)It had be hooked right from the beginning and wishing that she somehow magically ended up with the scarecrow king.Easy to follow and fall in love with!!! Very PG but I think this story is perfect just the way Jill Myles has written it.INSTANT FAN!Recommend to anyone who enjoys and great and exciting adventure and with a lovely romance to top it all off.I very glad I read this. And you will be to .
Great love hate romance with the STEP brother.  Really funny one liners and I really enjoyed there fight/loving relationship.Caleb is the super sexy bad boy that every girl falls for and his step sister is no different.  It was cool how the story talks about how people always this that the beautiful people have it easier and this story shows you all the down sides to when all people see is a beautiful face.  I both love and hate how much these two are in love.  kind of get sick of it BUT in saying that I think I will be buying the next one in this series to find out what is going to happen because just like a car crash I can't look away .
didn't like. Main character guy was to much of a d**k for me to enjoy.  I'm sure its a great read but just not for me .
Always enjoyed the Neighbour from Hell series and this one was no different!I enjoyed that it was set in  a different time but it anything  I found that this was my favourite in the series so far..Really easy to get into and addicted to! so be warned!(wished I could read it in my sleep)The story start off as a memory or a story telling and then you fall into it so easily.The sass and pranks are better in this book compared to the others and the romance just feels sooo real!Thank you R. L. Mathewson!Will continue to follow any of this series .
This story starts out as a depressing story of a girl/woman who is stuck raising her 2 year old sister because her mother is an addict,I would compare this to a modern day Cinderella with a modern day hero called Channing.I love the fighting the attraction fights they have.  And its seems not everything or everyone is being honest with her .
Loved this and it had me hooked from the start. A bit like Cinderella meets Inception. Really bazar but good.So well written and easy to follow but yet not.  One minute you kind of have an idea what is going on and then NOPE its all changed.BUT it is easy to keep up with.I hasn't really a fan of Tara Brown before this, having read a few of her other books but I really loved this one.I am so glad its going to be a series or at least have a second book to follow this one.I recommend to anyone of all ages. There is a little bit of romance but its all PG stuff.Only bad thing I think I can say about this book is that I think that the romance is a little stiff. I mean you feel the love between Sam and Erralynn but not the love between Erralynn and Bash.Anyway I think almost everyone will enjoy reading this book and getting lost in this world .
Always enjoy read your books Eve and this one is no different! Story line is great and I'm glad that the story line isn't all out in the open in the first half.  Well written and easy to follow.  Recommend to anyone and everyone to read! a happy feel good romance fantasy!  Keep writing Eve we need your books .
Worth so much more than just 5 stars!I have enjoyed reading this series so much and I will be really surprized if this doesn't become a movie.So great to read, I really glad that this book doesn't hold back!I hate it when you read a book and you feel like there is just something missing. WELL, you won't get that with this book series.I cant wait to read the next one I was a instant fan after reading the first book of this series called King Hall.This book is jam packed full of romance and danger and love and heart ache.I'm telling you , you will never be disappointed reading this series except for having to wait for this next one  :DRecommend to anyone over the age over 16 just because there is a lot of sexually umm content.  But also full of love .
Easy 5 star book!So easy to read and follow along. I enjoy even though you are following the characters you aren't told( or read) all of their plans.I LOVE the female lead Anna, she is so great! She strong and just a complete badass. She has the right amount of emotion and love.I hate it when the female lead is strong and kick arse but crys a lot. lol BUT that is NOT Anna.Just the right amount of adventure and love and kick arse-ness.Recommend to anyone who lobes to read about strong women in a man world. HAHA .
I didn't mind it.But it was all over rather quickly and I was left feeling...well disappointed. I felt a lot more could have gone into this book and I do realise it is a series but yeah the book itself doesn't hold enough for me. Sorry Kat Simons but that's a NO from me. LOL (hehehe .
I wasn't sure about this book even after reading the blurb for this book. BUT I am glad that I took the time to read it.I enjoyed that it wasn't as predictable as I thought was it going to be and I was actually surprized by the whole prince thing.I felt really sorry for Finley and even a bit of heartache in some places.Poor Finley couldn't catch a break!BUT I loved Aiden even if he was a cheesy wanker .
wasn't what I was excepting so I gave up. I did try to return it but no such luck.I was drawn to this book because of a book I read before it called 'Master of Crows' and I thought it would be a lot like that one and it might be but I gave up. because it couldn't old my interest long enough to get to the good stuff. I may try again and will edit this comment then and when I do .
I really was not excepting the story to come out the way it did.  I actually really enjoyed it!Great to read and follow even with the whole but mess in the middle. NOT predicable.I am so glad the whole story is in this one book. I could easy see someone trying to change it into a series but not even story needs to be more than one book.  Thank you Tara Brown you are easily becoming one of my fav authors!(yay you!)Recommend to all ages and there is fairly light romance in it ( a few sex scenes but nothing to crazy)And for anyone who like supernatural books .
Not very filling this story.The story itself is great though and I enjoyed reading it.But its short and didn't take me very long to finish.The ending felt rushed and a little bit incomplete, even though everything was squared away. Just a bit untidy .
I haven't read a shifter book for a while so I really enjoyed this.The story was very free flowing and I felt like it was real.  (I wish!)I will be looking out or checking out the other Bear chronicles to see if they are as worth it as this one was .
I really wasn't sure about this book, and in saying that I wish it was a full novel but it was still enjoyable to read.Good for anyone who doesn't have a lot of time and wants a quick feel good romance.Written well and smoothly. Characters are believable and easy to relate to .
I get what Kelly Oram was trying to do in this book. I understand that Claire is the opposite of her twin sister from the first book Chameleon.I was really looking forward to reading this book and had be contently checking Kellys list of book to see if it had come out yet.But I felt a little let down after reading this.  I did however enjoy the whole idea behind this book with the yin to her yang thing.Still written really well and easy to follow and I would recommend book addicts to take the time to read it so they can still follow along with the story.  I will be reading the next one when it comes out but I'm not nearly as excited as I was when I finished reading Chameleon .
I really really really enjoyed this book and I CAN NOT wait for the next one and was a little disappointed to see that this is the first and only one out in its series so far!!!I recommend to EVERYONE to read! I love how different it is and out of the box! The blurb really doesn't give anything away and I found that it was unpredictable and exciting.The book is written beautifully and I can honestly say that I am a INSTANT huge fan of Connie Suttle after reading this. I LOVE YOU CONNIE .
So... I cryed like a baby for the first part. Very emotional. Then i was just heartbroken for the middle then i had hope then i was angry and then upset! I love Nathan way more as a character then i did Caleb. Nathan is mysteries, sexy and broken..You will love this book, i have no doubt in my mind about that. Looking forward to the next one so much! Yay .
Two sexy arse werewolf ghosts? Hell yes!!Loveable story line that you just can't help but fall into. I wasn't really sure where this story was going to take me.. But i loved it away.Again ONLY flaw is too short. I cry out for a full 400 page book from you Eva Langlais! U will make me a happy woman if and when u decide to do one! Thanks for being my fav author, so I can stalk you writing .
I really thought this would be as exciting as the first one was but i just feel a little let down but the way the story unfolds.Written well. Felt rushed and not at all how i felt it should have been done. She gives in after two months of dating him? They have a quickie wedding?! What the hell!! I would have liked more drama and romance and kyle proving himself with just more then words!!started off well, then just deflated .
Works great. price is a little high for what you get. I would recomened to a friend. Haven't had a problem with it. I have owened it for 8 months .
i got this scooter and im really happy about it... its really fun to ride, its smooth, fast, and awesome. one thing im not a big fan of is that u keep having to tighten the wheels and push down the bars or tight the bars so they don't pop out. Another thing is when i was riding my scooter, my quad clamp kept wobbling and when i was gonna tighten it with the screws, the bottom screw was lose so i tried to put it back in and it fell right out again when i was scooting. you probably wanna tighten the wheels and the clamp every moth. also u might wanna get new grip cuz they rip when you use them a lot. over all i love this scooter and its a good price and its fun to use .
This is the kind of book I could not put down!I just wanted to know more and more about these girls and how they would figure things out!Great read and easy to read also .
The case fits well and the buttons are easy to press. The case does add a bit of bulk, but it's not too noticeable. Overall, its a great case for the price .
It worked fine for about two weeks then the sound started to be a mess. Also, the sound cable is short. I hardly reached it to the sound input. This cable is not reliable and I wouldn't recommend it .
This was very useful since my desktop is upstairs and my router is downstairs. Didn't want to use wireless connection anymore for gaming, wanted hard line. with this 100ft cord, i had no problem wiring it to my computer upstairs. the connection speed is great and its very stable such as downloading and playing online .
Lots of space!!!! Love this HDD. This thing is awesome when it comes to storage. For me the shutdown and reboot isn't to slow with this HDD, that surprised me. I highly recommend this for people that need storage, for the cost its a good investment .
Its a great case, has all you need included for your build ie. screws, dampeners etc. it was an easy install for all my hardware, no problems what so ever. I'm enjoying this case very much. I recommend it .
Love this SSD. With is blazing speed on start up and shutdown. it defeats HDD in that, besides the storage. great SSD for my build. Can't wait until SSD are up to or beyond 2 TB and cost at least 100 dollars or less. that's going to be a turning point in history of TECH .
I can better make calls to prospects realizing many people say No or Not Right Now! I am ready to Work .
I don't have any complaints about the product except the lack of installation instructions. It was a lot smaller than I expected but that's not a problem .
Good game confusing at times but good it's not bad I enjoy it the puzzles are simple but the doors suck .
It is something of a rarity that I would write anything by way of review, however such was the hype surrounding this publication that I gave it a go and wish to very briefly share my thoughts in the aftermath.... I found the plot to be completely at odds with all logic and reason one would expect from a work so popular with women. The author romanticises abuse of women, schizophrenic episodes, Grey's being abused as an adolescent, irrational behaviour, stalker tendencies and any number of other huge character flaws simply because he is good looking and rich.....how he became a quasi billionaire by his late 20's... Well the author more or less lets the reader decide.Frankly the entire book leads the reader on a long, slow, death by a thousand wounds type journey that goes nowhere..... At no point could I say I was 'into' the book and I never had the tendency to burn the midnight oil and turn another page. I found the character and plot gaps far too large to be accounted for simply because this is a work of fiction.....And oft felt conflicted within myself to even complete the book.I'd think long and hard about putting my worst enemy through its 500 pages.... Erotica will more than take the place of this book in terms of plugging a 'gap' if that's what's whetted ones appetite. Steer clear at all costs .
the heating is good, but the two ironers does not fit pretty well. Sometimes you need to push hard to iron the hair.opps .
It is good to practice. although I did not do well, the ball has a good quality. you can choose some other size .
it is good at the high speed. while the low speed, it is too low, I thought. I do not used to it .
pretty good, I got the email quite quickly. And pay with it at a convenience. I do not know other aspects .
WHAT A LIFESAVER!! Not much faith in pills but this stuff is incredible!! No more medication for my hip pain and restless leg pain. I felt relief after 3 days and still can't believe that I actually found something that works.I tell everyone about it .
This game is harder than temple run.it is more hand and eyed control.learn how you are not able to make it past 50,800 yards .
Poor story line and really boring at times. The series could have ended at book 2.Will not recommend it .
When my screen got here it was all bent up from shopping, I couldn't even use it. Tried to put it on but it was so bent it wouldn't even stick, had to throw it out .
I really enjoyed this clear and practical unemployment guide, do not need to spend more time for this topic is just the precise length .
this game is awesome I don't like the qb view it annoying other then that its awesome GO GIANTS GO .
It;s just OK&#62;  I didn't feel the book itself was anything special. It was interesting though.  I wouldn't recommend it .
Since I carry a lot of stress in my neck and shoulders I find this product to be adequate, but no more so than a regular heating pad.  You cannot lie down with it or sit comfortably in a recliner.  You have to be in an upright chair in order for it to lay right on your back .
I realy do not know. I bought it for my sister who liked it very much. She has the series .
This cd would not play on either of my cd players. This is the first time that this has happened .
I do not know how one can use a Kindle Fire without one of these chargers. This one works fine .
This one is for me!!!  I purchased the new Kindle Fire for myself.  Was not happy with the I Pad .
The product met my expectations for quality , the problem was I didn't receive the items on the advertisement , was sent duplicates while others where missing .
This is the perfect thermos. It keeps drinks cold. It can be used with one hand while driving.  Doesn't spill .
I am an avid gun collector who buys them mostly for hobby collecting. Because of my being a collector, I demand the highest authenticity and quality in my firearms and their components. My recent acquisition is an AK47 (AKM) that came without a cleaning rod that is absolutely necessary for an authentic looking AK. This particular cleaning rod is mil spec and 100% authentic with great quality for not just completing the &#34;look&#34; of my AK47, but as an actual cleaning rod. Item came to my home very fast after I ordered it .
All was great n fine other than the cash i had to pay once it showed up at the door, unless i just missed that fine print. It was another 15 bucks to have it delivered which really pissed me off due to the fact that i don't recall readin that that charge would be added. I guess maybe it could e amazons why of making prices look better then what they end up being .
I think this woman needs to keep her role as a housewife and forget about singing, this album is so LAME, BORING, WEAK, perfect for someone that has give up in life and just want to hide and cry in the corner of a room, will NEVER buy anything from this woman, waste time, money and part of my life .
**ARC provided by author for honest review. Thank you for the opportunity!**Picture perfect was just that... Perfect. I loved every second of it and I kept reading. I needed to keep reading. I wasn't disappointed at all. I never read the first one in the series and being as this is a standalone if was fine. I loved the storyline.Skye, our leading lady is dealing with a recent breakup when one of her best friends takes her out to get out of her funk. No one knows the details of her breakup and being the daughter of a politician she wants to keep it that way. She is beautiful, sophisticated and confident. I really liked that about her. While out with her friend she has a crazy encounter with a sexy and mysterious guy. Of course she can't get him out of her head and when he walks into her new job...Landon is gorgeous, headstrong, determined and yes, sexy! He's worked his way to get to where he was. He made sure to stay true to his roots, be domineering when he had to be and also just be an all-around great guy! After a crazy night out and a girl that he can't forget, he heads to work.Both realizing who the other was tantalizing and endearing. Of course they had to draw lines and not get involved. Neither could forget and neither wanted too.There is so much sexual tension between the two that you can't help rooting for them to get it on! You slowly watch as these two realize that there is more than to it than that and when outside inference starts to really mess things up you want growl in anger.Will they get their happily ever after? Will Skye's private life from her past ruin everything? Will Landon be able to truly give his heart to someone and settle down?You'll just have to read and find out! This was one great book and it's definitely a series that I will revisit again and again!**Visit Bookwormmisfit.blogspot.com for more reviews on my favorite and not so favorite books .
I love her books!  So worth taking your time.. please don't change your style like other authors are doing moving into young adult..  have been ADDICTED since the beginning .
love this book.  I can't wait to read more of her stories.  Love the in depth descriptions and feeling like you are there .
Broke after two weeks. Get what you pay for. When it did work it was great. Don't waste ur money. Spend the extra on a good one .
I bought this for my husband and he is really pleased with this case.  Great color too.  Can't beat it for the low price .
This book immediately changed my life for the better.  The writing jumps off the page and into your mind and begs for a second glance, if not a third or fourth, etc.  The morning I got to reading this book I literally shit myself it was so powerful and succinct.  I would give this book more stars than 5 if it were possible .
So far no negative comments! It actually gives me the energy to keep working out. Even with some energy to spare after. But like others have said, don't expect results if you're not going to work for it .
These mats are great! No more scrubbing the bottom of the oven after a mess. Fits perfectly in my oven. Definitely going to tell my friends an Amazon account to buy these .
I have been using Penetran Plus for a few years now, and I just can't give it up! I have heard of others that worked for some people, but this is what I need .
I recommend this to all those with serious back pain. I am physically disabled and have severe back and neck pain. I have experienced fast, real relief from Penetran Plus because it makes you feel like you never had a really bad back/neck ache at all .
bad output ......sound quality out was not that good.......makes noises. and look wise it is big..i expected it to be tiny...but it is large .
Great shoes, my kid love themThe next shoe will be Osiris again for sure, no doubt about it. Great .
I'm enjoying my brusheslove them a lotwill buy more brushes soon can't wait:) yah!!awesome tools to have .
this game is so awesome I got all my friends playing angry birds all the time however who hasn't been put in the anger zone lol .
I play this game for hours on end and it was only suppose to be a filler for time however with farming and watching all the talking going on I find myself never putting down this game I made it to lvl 6 in 3 days of playing pretty fun cruising around blowing up ships. :) my name is Spankyness on the game ask to join usmc in the blue sector and you will have fun also .
Good game just needs some changes in game play don't like that my soldiers don't come back as I left them and have to pay to level them up again .
super fun with a little extra addiction to it and is easy to pick up the how to play part. However when your done playing it doesn't always goes off gets stuck on .
People that see my review and read it you will want to get this app INSTANTLY. I'm  not kidding this is like a version of Temple Run except it has three lanes and you just have to try it for yourself go on DOWNLOAD IT NOW well you don't have to if you don't want to but just download it okay bye .
Seems to work ok, but different than any others I have played. Won't suggest others buy it, but that would be up to them.NO .
It was a perfect size, perfect fit, perfect condition! I Loved the jeans, theres not one thing to complain about .
I really didn't know if this was worth getting at first. I thought about just getting the Japanese version because I worry about things being lost in the translation, also I was worried they would leave some out of the English version.The cover is a lot nicer than I thought it would be, there are a lot of great colored pages on the inside with notes about all the designs and sketches. Interesting though that the notes are not made by those who did the original designs, so I do wonder if these comments were added to the english, or if the Japanese version also has them, and also who wrote them and why?I haven't read all of the Japanese version but the translation seems very solid.As a fan of the Zelda games I think this book is a must have, has it has so much extra information about each game and now that I have it I like this cover better than the Japanese version. It's very green! Like Link .
It is very gold and shiny! I mean, a lot more than the picture would have you believe. I haven't put it on my car yet, but I am sure it will look good, and show up on most surfaces and colors. It's a good size too, so it will show up well. I'm not sure about how well it will stay once places since I haven't put it on yet, but I'm sure it will be fine .
Im glad i checked the reviews. This is NOT a crossbow for sale at a great price. Its just the quiver and arrows .
This supplement is for long term fat reduction. All that said it works just not fast. To lose weight the right way takes time other wise it just comes right back. The taste is about as bad as it gets but is worth it .
This book started off very interesting, and then it went into weird land. Monkey's on Oak Island? Wasn't sure where this author was going .
Best Barrette you will ever own! I have a lot of hair and its extremly thick. This barette will hold all of my hair. The only hair clip you will ever need. I have looked everywhere for a barette like this, but you can only get it online. Amazon is the best because it has it on prime! This is my second one, not because it broke, but because I loose everything. If you are careful not to misplace it than expect it to last you a while .
These are wonderful!! The best flip flops I own. I bought a pair a few years ago and they just broke :( but they lasted forever as I wore them every day every where for a few years in the warmer months. They are so comfortable and stylish too. I walk in them a couple miles around my neighborhood and my feet don't hurt! Now as far as firming your butt or legs..they do not do that. As far as price: I would never pay more than $50. for them .

not compatible at all difficult to use did not respond to touch screen not worth it al all believe it is just a ploy for you to pay for upgraded product .
I bought this thinking that it would be great to have instead of just an e reader.  It was not compatible with the kindle app at all and the e reader app on it was not what I was looking for.  Also cannot turn off the foreign language on the calendar .
It's really a good product. Excellent quality! I recommend this privacy to everyone. Good screen protector and no one can look at what you're doing .
I was surprised by this book. Not what I expected but it is a must read for those who live romance .
I don't think I have  ever cried so much while reading a book....heart shattering story that leaves you wanting more .
This has  got to be one of the best books (series) ever. I don't think I have  ever been so emotionally involved in a book. It was wonderful .
Wasn't sure about this book but I am so grateful that I did read it. A very good book and so worthwhile .
I have been waiting for this book for what seems like forever, and was not disappointed!  Can't wait until the 3rd book comes out, because this one kind of leaves you hanging .
I LoVE this series and I love love this book!  Absolutely wonderful story!  I laughed, I cried and don't forget the HOT parts .
I have ordered this item in 3 different sizes and still have yet to find the correct size.  I go off the sizing information but it doesn't work.  I usually wear a 38C and my waist is 35 and hips are 41.  Even the 42 C was to small... I had to return them.  I started feeling bad about myself because nothing was fitting .
One of the easier wet applications that I've done. I'm using this without a case and it has yet to separate going in and out of my pocket. Very clear and good adhesion. My only complaint is that &#34;Ultra Clear&#34; also means &#34;Super Glare.&#34; Nothing I can't live with though. A slightly matte version would get 5/5 .
The case I received was plastic not rubber. Very disappointed in description. It fits great but not what I expected .
Not a good quality. The zipper fall and falkland we had to fix it by our self!!and plus the stuff on there start falling off the next day, really disappointed about this product .
Can't believe I paid over $70.00 for thisAnd open the capsule to find choc powerInside :-(.  Smell and taste of hot choc powered ,now have 90 to get rid of are make hot choc lol Don't buy you will be disappointed ...&#8230 .
Not worth the money,u can buy nuquiland get the same sleep. Disappointed&#60;:(&#62; excepted better. &#60;&#60;&#60;&#62;&#62;:(((((&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;Don't waste your time or money .
It's tall, but narrow so it does not take up too much counter space.  I can tuck it right beside the Keurig.  I can use one side or both sides .
It works very well. No problems at all. I would by two. I only bought one the first time and had to switch it from one wheel to another .
Over all I like this bike. It's big! I'm six feet one or two inches tall. It's very nice having a bike that actually fits. I read another review before I bought the bike that said the pedals are not the same. You don't get the ones in the picture. It's true. That's probably the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars .
I saw this same bed somewhere else for $70 and was willing to pay that for it. I've spent $40 on other beds that tore up in no time. This bed is amazing and well worth the price. The whole bed is just plain durable. The mattress is thick and filled with something that won't go flat. The cover is removable and either double or triple sewn. I can't remember....not looking at it. But I'm very impressed and highly satisfied. God bless .
I use this machine for every dress or garment I do it works great. Not  realy hard to thread and im 12 so its not hard and useing is easy doesint take a lot of effort to get the tension right for the type of fabric you are using.But Brother does need to make a new instructional DVD it's bad quality and old .
I started reading The BoogieTrapp and could not put it down. The character's were so real and colorful. This is the kind of book that draws you in and keeps you intertwined in the pages. It is a magical story and I was bummed out when it was over. Definitely a must read. I can't wait to read his next book.Bijou .
The shower head is very easy to install.i like  the shower massage modes offered for the price.Did not see quite a change in the pressure or flow of water after fixing this one !not sure on the purifying and elimination of the chlorine ,but guess its doing its job .
I rarely read novels to say the least.  Documentary/historical reading is my thing... but I do love BBQ and Thin Blue Smoke crossed my path via a reliable book source.  So, I read it.. quickly.  Literally I couldn't put it down.  I've shared it with my son, an avid reader, and suggested it to several friends.  Excellent characters - very real.  I strongly recommend it .
A book about a terrible decrease which almost always ends badly. Yet this book is about teenagers who happen to have cancer, but are regular teenagers. Sad topic, not a sad story. Gives perspective .
To read such a gorgeously honest, unpretentious story is pure bliss. In such a guarded world, Vosloo bares his soul, which makes it impossible not to fall in love with the rawness and honesty of his story .
I saw Shawn on TV and really found his presentation great . I wanted to read the entire book and I like to re-read as many times as it strikes me to do so . His work is filled with no -nonsense information and downright good humour . I would recommend this book to anyone as a must read .
I like the surprising twists and turns in this book. I could not put my Kindle down. This book deserves 5 stars .
when it came it was a scratched up and it wouldn't stick to the screen -.- i don't recommend any one wasting their money on this .
when it came i was so happy it was perfect :D nothing wrong with the wifi signal or anything like that. the only thing though that by the second day one of the little diamond thingys came off but other than that its great and no one really noticed XD .
When I try to take a picture with the front facing camera there's an annoying white thing that's in the way. Thats Because the camera cut out is misplaced I wish that wasn't there, but other than that it's a cute case .
the cheese grater is great for long periods of use if the noise it makes is very strong, no problem if you do not mind .
the sound is also very good and crisp tuning problems of which I had read previously not found them, just a matter of a few daysrefine it with piano or tuner and after the strings yield and there is no problem and can play many songs, the course is not very good I recommend buying a better ukulele without lessons.the ukulele is very good quality I highly recommend it .
It was an ok book. I enjoyed it and I think you would too! If you read a couple of Jim's book you should know that his books are great. This one is about Jamie and Isabella always together well they make a theory that her pants are haunted because of things that have been happening. Well their popularity is dropping and they are trying to get it back. They destroy the pants but learn they weren't haunted. There is a story to everything that happened. They destroy the pants and give it to Angeline. That gave Angeline her popularity back. It also hosted up Jamie and Isabella's .
To be honest all of these books are really good and I never want to stop reading it I'm sure the same with u u should really read it .
This book is cool and funny I highly recommend this book and if u haven't read it u is missing out yo I mean dude really u needs ta read tis bookPEACE  OUT .
OMG This is amazing  and if u haven't read it u r a loser and yo I'd read it nowPEACE OUT.  MEOW .
I'm gonna bet that if my appliance broke down that I bought this warranty for they will stand behind it. It's my 1st time buying an extended warranty and with the power of the internet it would not be good business not to stand behind there product .
Just purchased the STX for making our own venison sausage.  It took about 45&#34; to grind 80 lbs of pork, would have went faster but one person cutting the meat to fit in the throat of the grinder could not keep up with the grinder. It took 5&#34; to grind 17 lbs of venison trim. It would bog down a bit when the pork was a little fatty but still did a fine job. Felt the side of machine to check if it was getting hot but was only warm which is normal.  We did not try stuffing with the machine since we already had a bigger stuffer. But if we were to use it I would be concerned about the length of the tubes that were supplied, seemed a bit short (only 4&#34;). We usually grind between two to three hundred pounds of meat per year and this machine is fine for that. I am very happy with this machine and would recommend it .
All went well with the purchase and delivery of Nioxin Diamax, but the product did not work as well as it did the previous time I used it. The consistency of the product felt different on my fingers and did not work as well on in my hair .
Great for the price loves it the only thing was the whole thing was purple not like it is in the picture where like half is black. That was disappointing but other than that everything was good and it arrived fast .
This case is okay. A little flimsy but it works all the same. Shipped fast and you really can't beat the price so I'm happy with it .
I was wery about this product but I thought I'd try them out. I'm a size 8.5 so I bought the medium/large and they fit perfect. They have a rubber piece in the back so they don't slip off, and they are very comfy. Only reason I'm not giving five stars is they said I'd be getting black white tan and grey but I only received two black and two tan .
Very cute shirt! I love Allegra k. It fit perfectly I got a medium and its true to the size. Comfortable and it didn't take too long to ship. The suggestion said about one month to arrive and I was happy it arrived early .
Absolutely love this bag. Two side pokers and it's not huge. It's just right to hold all my crap. Love the design and I need another one .
I absolutely loved this season. Everyone was talking crap about it and about how dexter is getting out of control. Well FYI people that's how it's supposed to be. He's a serial killer and his character is getting out of control. I can't wait for the next season because this season ended really crazy. I love of a bunch of stuff I didn't expect happened lots of twists and turns .
I missed this episode the Sunday that it aired an I was so upset I had to get it. I absolutely live this show it's one of my favorites ever! Great episode can't wait to see what else is in store .
Love this hoodie. I'm obsessed with this s***. I take a woman's medium and I got the small and it fits perfectly. So comfortable and worth the price it's not a bad price .
Just Dance Kids 2 - Xbox 360 : This game is not compatible with my geographic area, I returned it to Amazon .
This book is a great motivator for those who are heading into college or those who are debating about going back to college.  This book is great for any age group; it speaks to those who are going to be experiencing the trial and tribulations of college.  And those who have already experienced college and are not feeling confident enough or are embarrassed to go back to college because of the age range is so different.  I liked how he included goals for you to reflect on and the goals to start striving towards to make all of your dreams and goals become reality.  I also liked how he was able to speak freely about his life experiences and still maintain a positive attitude even when he felt like he was at his lowest points in his goals. He went through many trials and tribulations through his life that was expressed in this book and each time he was tested he was able to move forward with a positive attitude and he was still able his dreams become reality.  So overall this is an excellent book to read for everyone and it is a positive motivator to those who want to be successful in college.  This book will help anyone become successful and stay motivated in achieving all their goals .
This iPhone was refurbished. It was described accurately, but has proven to have some sending/receiving problems such as not getting certain messages (picture and text). I do not know however of this is due to the actual iPhone or the cell phone provider. All in all the seller did a great job in sending the product to me quickly- before the estimated date of arrival .
does this come with the blade too? because it talks about the blade but it is cheap. i guess i will find out when it gets here, but if not how to i return it .
The Person doing teaching acted like he could care less, and he was ready to go home. Didn't learn much .
did not receive this item or mini brass microscope with illuminator. did receive other items listed. was satisfied withother items/ray .
This arrived on schedule and it's very pretty, and, surprisingly it's washable.  I would give it 5 stars, but the fabric is easily snagged and I'm afraid it won't look good for long .
I loved this book and I think that it will be a great asset for those who suffer from low self esteem, including teenagers. It would be such a good gift to give someone who is going through difficulty so that they can change their lifestyle and feel much more comfortable in their skin.I love the assertive way it is written, testament to the author's transformation! (e.g. ...we suffer from self sabotaging behaviour; STOP IT!)It is so full of tips that can be used over time, I feel this is not a book to read once, rather, to pick up during your week and dip into so that you can follow what you are drawn to and then implement it. Even one of the tips-drinking lemon water to balance the acidity of the body-can change your life!I love the inclusion of inspirational videos at the end of it too .
so i purchases this and its is really cheap so i guess i understand but i don't know i thought it would be better the case itself fits fine and its definitley plastic there is no cushion inside and it has like a thin rubber layer that peeled off almost instantly so i would not recommend this not worth it .
purchased this specific one because it shows you will be receiving all the tools you need to change the screen and they don't actually send all the tools you need there are six shown in the image and i only received two , tried contacting them about completing the shipment and they would'nt worst customer service will not be purchasing from this seller ever again .
i got this tape to change a phone screen and it is really cheap not very sticky tape at all would not recommend this if you are trying to do a good job .
The front part of the case when opened up serves the purpose of a ergo style handmat which i really like and definitely makes typing much more comfortable.Keys on the board are rubberized and have a pretty nice feel to them. The 20 day charge times really depends on just how much you use it, I guess that's because I use it all the time, but I can say it last for quite some time. The best part is it charges very quickly.Anyway i look at it, the overall value is unbeatable and as far as function is concerned, hasn't let me down over the past 2 months so i have no problem recommending it to anyone .
This book goes into great detail on how to survive the knock down when you have to Take a drug test this book should be read front to back before you go.  If you have medications you take then you should read this book before you go test.  I had the knock down and did not have the information needed to fight this situation and boy did it come in handy.  Great book for anyone that has to take a drug test of any kind for any reason.  Its one of those books you can't put down, the info in it  has knowledge the general public should know long before you go take a drug test.  For those that have to take prescription medication its a must.  Every Cold Medicine in your house can make you Fail your test.  But if you go in for that test knowing what I know NOW because of this book, then you shouldn't have any PROBLEMS.  All because of some sinus medicine I was taking I lost a job I had landed after being off work for 1 1/2 years and had a sinus infection going on when I went to test had been taking OTC sinus medicine I was knocked down .
I ordered the Stanley BC209 - 2 Amp battery charger.  The product I received is a 1.2 Amp battery charger; NOT a 2 Amp as advertised.  Completely false advertising!  The charger does not even look like pictured, but has the same model number .
I bought Nobody Loves A Bigfoot Like A Bigfoot Babe in kindle version. Lately, I am not reading fiction, but I started reading this book, and I was pretty sure that I live in that very forest, step on the same shrubs that Bigfoot steps, feel the same as the Bigfoot do, understand their open innocent eyes, their feelings...On one hand, I wanted to flip page after page faster and faster to see what's going on behind the next bush, or to hear an answer of an opponent in a conversation. On another, I did not want the book to be over soon.I was laughing out loud forgetting that I am sitting in my char, but not participating in all events in Big Beaver. Once in a while, I was trying to identify in which character the author lives. I got an impression, but how could I possibly know? Obviously the author is a very kind and sensitive person!I did not want the book to be over so soon, but blasts do not last forever .
After two teens in my family read  &#8220;Switch&#8221; and talked about the book with excitement, I decided to check it out for myself. I found the book very original and involving. It appeared to be that it's interesting for people of differed ages. I learned from it.  My nephews learned a lot from it!. Isn't it what we want for our kids: to enjoy and develop at the same time .
I bought Phantom Bigfoot Strikes again in kindle version. Lately, I am not reading fiction, but I started reading this book, and I was pretty sure that I live in that very forest, step on the same shrubs that Bigfoot steps, feel the same as the Bigfoot do, understand their open innocent eyes, their feelings...On one hand, I wanted to flip page after page faster and faster to see what's going on behind the next bush, or to hear an answer of an opponent in a conversation. On another, I did not want the book to be over soon.I was laughing out loud forgetting that I am sitting in my char, but not participating in all events in Big Beaver.

It works great. Support this seller. Good product, great service. Don't overpay when you don't have to. I wish I could get everything I need as such a good price .
I had to buy this book for my Web Scripting class. I'm not totally unfamiliar with Javascript but I think that even for Novices the techniques in this book are quite sophisticated. I do not recommend this book as a beginner book. The college did not properly prepare me or the the other students to tackle the lessons in it. I don't think its structured well at all. I've always been of the opinion that if something is really difficult to learn, perhaps its not being taught that well. I feel anyone can learn anything but after reading this book and doing the lessons I feel like I just got done tying my shoes with boxing gloves on. No matter how good I get with this book. The guy without the boxing gloves on will kick my ass every time. I he never had to struggle as hard. I'm convinced the good reviews of this book are written by employees of the company that published this book or some of Murach's friends and relatives .
THE ORIGINAL PRICE IS $995 and sold it at 69.99. I am wondering how can it be valued as $995 as there is nothing on the watch worth that amount. I can't help to think this is a hoax. I was lured by the high discount but acutally it does not worth each the amount after discount. Would anybody explain to me? I am in China and it is impossible to return the watch. Otherwise I will return .
It heats up pretty fast and gets to a nice temp.The reason why i don't use it so much... its itchy and rough on the skin .
When I put the batteries in it didn't start right away, I had to mess with it a bit.The power is pretty strong, definitely gets the job done.My only complaint is its LOUD. I'm pretty sure my neighbors can hear it .
I spent the first two weeks thinking the glue came off In the back and it was falling apart (that's what it feels like), not a fan of the stand feature. The sea green and purple case is very pretty in person. Card slots are a nice size, and it doesn't look bulky with 2 or 3 cards in it. Don't count on the bonus screen protector to last long. Arrived on the last expect shipping day, long wait for a cell phone cover .
I got this lenses because i have been looking for red or rudy lenses for a long time.This lenses are really nice they look just like on the pice.No dislikesI would recommend this to people looking for red or ruby lenses .
I got this lights for gifts and because they are small in size.This LED lights are really good quality and i like that the light beam can adjust.No dislikesI would recommend this LED light to anyone looking for a nice pocket light .
This game is fun but very hard to really collect extra stuff.. and its weird how everything is laid out. I like it but kinda don't. Lol im just not sure yet .
As I have tried to tell amazon several times before, I have not opened the package as of yet, but am saving it as a gift in the future. Have no idea what they look like .
Great pictures! Enjoy the puzzles ! Even my husband will play now with the chooses available. All the fun with none of the mess and lost pieces .
Beautiful puzzles!  I enjoyed every moment and no pieces to keep forever!!!  My husband even got in on the fun .
This game is not only fun, but it is also educational.  My grandchildren love music and they love this game.  This game can even allow my Little "virtuosos" to practice musical scales .
Jumbo to me indicates &#34;larger than normal&#34;.  I wrote to the seller for a clarification and he indicated he could not open the box for sanitary purposes - fair enough - but it should have indicated on the outside of the box something more detailed than length.  So i took a chance and was charged $75 for shipping on the item!!!!  Disgusting.  Anyway, the box arrived and I opened it to discover there was 2500 normal straws.....Jumbo ONLY indicated the box size - nothing to do with the straws.  There are 2 different size of straws - one is the normal one and one has a diameter larger than normal drinking straws  - for thicker fluids - that is what I was looking for.  Do you know anyone who wants 2500 normal drinking straws - they are useless for my purpose .
This book is well written with a lot of information. There are many recipes and the information collected about the history of the spice trade is nice. I was a little let down for the fact that there is not a list for many spices. Good read and many recipes .
Packed full of information. Not just for the professional cook, but for beginners as well. Dozens and dozens of recipes. Many step by step instructions .
I have used Birchwood Casey in the past re-bluing an entire sks rifle without a problem. I purchased the complete kit and was not disappointed. Re-blued the bolt on my older Winchester M-70 rifle. Just take your time and use good gun oil in the finish. Great product. If you make a mistake, just do it over... You will get it right .
This knife is awesome. Shipping was super fast, three days and it was here. It's big, sharp and strong. I have no doubt that it can stand up to the toughest challenges. The sheath is easily manipulated into a belt sheath, just use some common sense and a D ring. I converted it because the plastic clasps on the sheath strap would never hold up in the field. I'm not taking anything away from the rating because of this. The blade and sheath are in great order .
It is fit my phone, but the glass lense for the camera is opaque instead of clear. I can't use my camera function with this product.Plus, now that backside stuck in my phone, i can't take it off and now i have to make an appointment with apple to solve this problem. Such a bad product. I won't trust amazon anymore .
Garrett Soldano did an outstanding job with this book.  Very easy to read and lessons to apply to your life.  Highly recommended .
This product was not what I wanted and it did not go on smooth it was all gross and clumpy and smudged on your face I DON'T RECOMMEND THIS .
Exactly what we wanted. Came In a timely fashion. Didn't pay a lot of attention to original cord until it walked away on its own .
I was desperate for new sheets and wanted something soft but didn't have alot to spend. Amazon to the rescue with these super soft sheets for a awesome price .
the product is great. I should have bought a case for this. The product is what I have expected. Battery last about a day or two, no turning off. But depends on your use. I think the software is great, just don't expect much on the apps. But for the price, it is already good .
I only needed to lose 10 pnds & I only lost 2 pnds in a month... I was very dissatisfied with this diet.. I was always hungry & extremely weak... Would not reccomend to someone who needs to lose 20 pnds & less .
Not bad. Its an Ok movie. Some good scenes by very predictable. Watch it and see for yourself. Ending was weak .
I got this for my child because it does the things a seven year old child needs it to do. People who are getting this tablet for themselves and expecting it to be an iPad are setting themselves up for failure. If you'll notice on most of the pictures for this tablet, there are children movies on the screen. Its basically geared towards kids or not really needing to do more than read or play games. Its only 8gb so it can't hold very much. Its a 7 inch screen so it isn't big. Please compare the price and understand what you're paying for. Great for just basic use. All the negitive comments are from people expecting the best from the cheapest price. The same people are also upset that their Kia got beat by a Porsche. You get what you pay for .
This gloves are amazing I've been using them just to do parkour and they have a really good grip on ledges making it hold onto them much easier and climb easier I love them also since they are fingerless I can use my iPhone with no problem .

I would give it 5 stars except it does not sinc with my Thunderbolt. Go to FitBit.com to see the phones compatible with the Flex. I sleep, shower, and just forget about it till I sinc with computer. Even though it will not sinc on my phone the last sinc on computer will show up and I can still add all my food, fluids on my phone. Price comparison on certain products are MUCH LOWER IN PRICE on AMAZON! If ordering new color bands from the company expect at least two weeks wait like I am doing now. Check Verizon stores to see if they have them in stock .
GARBAGE!!!...I am soooooooooo disappointed with this thing!! I have tried everything short of welding this thing together!!! The poles are cut too short to stay in the holes correctly. They should have been made to screw or snap in, then it would have been fine. I am hoping I can send it back for a full refund. I strongly do not recommend this for anyone .
Classic Jamiroquai greatness. LOVE, LOVE LOVE this and will continue to buy and enjoy his music. I'm not sure why he is not HUGE here in the states, we're really missing something&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733 .
Wonderful book, couldn't put it down.  It amazes me what one passionate person can accomplish, especially if he has good people willing to help .
I have been suffering from chronic Lyme for the past four years, but it was only this summer that I was officially diagnosed and began treatment. I wanted to thank you for sharing your story. I just received the book for Christmas, and I am about half way done with the book. In every chapter I connected with something that you wrote and this was very meaningful for me because as we both know, we are battling a disease that &#34;doesn't exist.&#34; But we do exist, and your words helped me with the validation of the symptoms that I have been feeling all of these years, and it is not just all in my head.Thank you for being brave enough to be brutally honest about what this disease is doing to people like us. I intend to share it with all of my friends and family on my support team.Today I started IV treatment and this book has helped me to realize that I am not alone. I recommend this book to everyone who is suffering from Lyme or knows someone who is effected .
I bought these tires right at 3000 miles ago for my 2005 Honda Aero. I never even thought I would have to be looking to purchase new tires for 5000 to 8000 miles though my back tire is completely bald! I have had the proper air inflation throughout the usage of this tire so that was not a factor! As I stated in the title they really hold the road as the rubber is very soft! So if you are looking to do some extreme riding then this might be your tire? I will be purchasing another brand from this point on .
The knife was alright for what I bought it for, but in the description it said it was a Boker knife and it sure didn't say Boker on the knife anywhere. I think it was misrepresented in the photo and description .
I have used this product both day and night.  All skin types especially those with sensitive skin like mine can be assured the product will not cause redness or skin abrasions .
I am in mid-level manager, correctional professional, as well as, an instructor or Hostage Negotiator. This is a great book for anyone wanting to remove a little stress in dealing with difficult people, whether they be inmates, staff or anyone else. If you don't use any of the practices, they'll never work. Using a few of them you'll see the benefits of getting others to understand your side of an arguement. You may not change their mind but you'll probably gain their respect. Again, great book .
I enjoyed reading the ebook. It was short but informative with basic information about the way we feel, think or perceive others as we relate that to ourselves. Well worth the price! If you don't like it ask for a refund .
Great Price... Nearly half of what I was going to spend at the home improvement stores. Worked well on my new chicken coop. No problems .
I purchased this item because the local stores were out of stock and I was afraid that I would not be able to find one before Christmas. My son loves it but I was very unsatisfied due to the price gouge. The product sells in department stores for 29.99. I paid 51.99. The department stores had them back in stock before Christmas but I wasn't willing not to pay the extra price in hopes that my son wouldn't have to go without the only thing he really ask for .
I never had a problem with allergies and/or detergents but I have had a horrible reaction to this product. After several days of trying to figure out what was causing the massive hives all over my body. I finally had an ah huh moment.. Now Im rewashing tons of clothes in vinegar trying to element the damages. Never again. I can't even touch it .
this is nice for those moments that my laptop mouse is being crazy. I can plug and go with no wait time .
they are stiff and have the high arch. But hopefully with some breaking in they will be wareable during work hours. They are not going to be dance shoes .
I was looking for something that my young one could use and learn on. it sucks that can only be used when you are connected to wfi. the app store sucks even more than the crome book. I wish I would have spent my oney on a lap top. so not worth it .
I am extremely fair skinned and this product is not streaky or orange, it is the best self tanning product I have tried and believe me, I've tried a lot .
After wearing the necklace once, it broke and I can no longer wear it. I did enjoy it though. You get what you pay for .
Bought for my fiance', I almost didn't give her this necklace poor quality and just sad when you (myself) are a musician and this poor thing comes .
Great shoe very light weight and comfortable. The shoe is very narrow from the toe to the bridge if the foot. If you have a wide foot this isn't the shoe for you. I would suggest if you order this shoe get one size larger than you wear. Love running in this shoe .
Poster revolution is the best!!! I ordered the poster and it wound up lost in the mail. Contacted poster revolution,and got a response from them within 2hours stating they would redeliver my order at no charge to me,received it yesterday!! Will definetly by from them again,and strongly recommend them to everyone .
Editing in PhotoShop, I was having problems selecting the pixels I wanted.  So I decided to try a gaming mouse.  This Anker mouse solved any jitter problems I had.  Plus the extra programmable buttons along with being able to change DPI on the fly makes editing much faster.  I don't know how I managed without this mouse, a perfect solution for my needs and well worth the money .
Why would EA take franchise mode off. Me and my brother always go buy madden every year to challenge each other to see which one of us can get our team to the Superbowl, but now we can't because their is no franchise. What is wrong with them .
Its okay. It looks like it did online. Its great I just don't like how thin and dented it was. but other then that its fine .
it does not fit a Winchester Model 1300 vent rib shotgun. Should be more explanatory. Can't return it. Worthless to me .
Really like these dies. I reload military brass and regular brass. Have never had a problem with the military brass getting stuck as I lube good with Lee resizing Lube. It even removed the Bredan primers. I would recommend these dies to anyone. The data sheet needs to be designed so that it doesn't fold on the reloading data .
Great stuff. Really cleans and smooths the bore. Won't use anything else.Made the bore in a 1903 Springfield shine. Actually improved accuracy .
This is great brass and very clean. Looked like it had been tumbled. Removed the primer and tumbled, looks a good as new.Didn't have to clean the primer hole. Only got one small primer brass which I could have used more of them. Can't complainat the prices & great service. Will be ordering plenty more .
Very awesome book & I'm only half way through it ! Not only does it suggest excellent points for your marriage but also about everyday life . HIGHLY RECOMMENDED .
Bought to replace battery that couldn't hold a charge and the new one ended up being worse then the first .
I was not sure where this story was a going but it kept my attention for sure ... Wow is all I can say . Can't wait for the next book .
If you are thinking to get this shoe rack, think about it twice..!I got this one cause I have tons of shoes, first at all I have to glue in order to ensemble it, after a month all the shoes come out and and this rack is not even fixable..!I would like to have a money return cause I spent almost US 30 in something that worked for a month :- .
big disappointment for a star trek movie no real plot & was more like an old shootemup western nothing I would ever pay to see .
I would recommend this to anyone who needs to get a gift right away and your long distance. It is fast. No worries. It offers the person hundreds of options for buying a gift that suits their wants. I purchased this for my Nephews wedding. I will be using this again and again. Holidays are suddenly looking so simple. I often have no clue what to give as a gift. This makes it so every gift will be the best gift .
Same as our first Kindle Fire HD. Son dropped it and we called to see what we could do. They gave us a discounted price and replaced it. It arrived fast (1-2) days. Took me longer to get it registered and reloaded with his apps and books. I strongly recommend parents get cases for Kindle 's that children will be dropping. We use them everywhere. On the go. Homeschooling. Reading. They are nice when you don't want to drag a toy box and 30 favorite books everywhere. Love the parent settings. Controls the content very well. Love the customer service for the most part. Their 'good' deal was 25 dollars more then a nearby store. However I'm looking at future needs and possible warranty issues. So far Amazon has been great when I need a human. Big plus .
If your into docking your smartphone. Then this is worth the money. I recently switched from a different brand which was set up just for docking. However the model I had was phased out. So I bought an S4 because it was one of the few our carrier offered that could be docked. We use this a lot. I am still looking for a program to make the screen better. Its not as screen friendly once docked but that is one of the brand issues. It offers several options with this docking station. Allows use with a key board and mouse. You can add addition speakers if your playing music. Great for charging. I have no complaints other then I miss the ease of my old brand. In time I will find the needed programs to make this better. The product itself is fine. It is everything that I was promised and shipping is very fast .
I received three packages and there was NO winners!!!!!!I still have all the tickets and there is definitely no winners.  Very embarrassed at party .
Super quick service, the first one didn't fit, they responded immediately with a new one, very happy. Would reccommend to others .
I just loved this book, Usually i`m pretty skeptic to book like this, but then again im not the spiritual type.After reading it i was stunned and i think everyone can learn from this book due to the fact that Mr Hawkinswrites stuff everyone can relate too .
I like this case, i have no complaints only that I thought the case would have came in earlier than it did .
This was not a good case,the first week that I received the case,it was already chipping, the back of the case with the hearts was nice,but the front of te case was terrible. The case looked as though the phone had been dropped a thousand time,but i just threw it away because it wasn't much for it .
5 star product.Just received it. Easy to assemble and mount on my wifes CRV. Fit all 4 bikes without a problem, sturdy. No wiggling or sensation it was gooing to fall off. Highly recommended .
missing discs,scratch disc threw it away.Complete waste of time and money.Would never buy music on amazon again because if it is damaged or there is a problem with it its not worth returning .
would recommend!! Sounds very good,no problem to hook-up.Shipping was fast and price was good.there was a small dent on to but I have it in a cabinet and it doesn't show .
at first I was not sure what to expect,  it looks like it is cheaply made,but after I received it and heard how good and clear my voice sounded, I was really happy ,Also my rose breasted cockatoo loves to hear my voice and can now say his name which is Teddy Bird .
I purchased two of the mud pie piggy banks online for my daughter and I can't seem to find them anymore :( wish you would ship to Canada ... I have checked amazon.ca and they are worth 3 times the amount that you have them on here for ... I love the mud pie piggy banks .
Kindle enables me to become an intelligent person! I am not wasting my time anymore! The touch screen dictionaries are incredibly useful -  my German is getting better .
I am in awe of Danielle Steele.  Her real life is far more intriguing than any book she ever wrote.  This book gave me a first hand look at the people on the streets and a realization of just how enormous this problem has become world wide.  I can't imagine doing this work for so many years and she and her friends deserve more credit  than I can express, along with all the other agencies who try to make a difference in this growing dilemma.  Anyone who has a heart for the homeless should read this book.  The financial cost of this particular operation boggles the mind, most of which was borne by Ms. Steele herself.  Maybe someday we will find a solution for this overwhelming situation .
I bought this book because I had read her book about her son Nick and her work with the homeless.  I do not normally read these kinds of books and did not finish this one.  I'm sure it would probably please her regular readers, however.  I stopped reading when her grandson announced he was gay, an obligatory detail necessary for selling books these days, I guess .
I love Richard Evans' wriiting and have most of his books, starting with "The Christmas Box."  I have all three Road books and anxiously await the next.  "Grace" is insightful and emotinally lifting.  Like his other works, there is no sex, violence or vulgarity, which is imprtant to me.  I can relax and lose myself in a story that I always find interesting and compelling .
This book appears to be a first effort, but has merit.  The plot twist was unique and there were some amusing incidents.  I enjoyed the book in spite of some of the obvious failings....typos, labored story line and over-drawn characters.  I might sound like a knowledgeable critic but I'm certainly not.  I've never written a book, so I have to give Ms.Jarmola credit.  I hope she keeps on writing.  I would recommend this book to people who like to read for relaxation.  It is totally free of bad language, sex and overt violence, hard to find these days and definitely a plus to me .
When the router arrived, I was ecstatic. Then the problems came. Although it could easily connect all of the devices in my home together, it couldn't connect to the Internet. I tried to get help from my ISP (Windstream), and despite our best efforts (changing modem settings, mostly), it wouldn't work.I connected our old router (a WRT54G) back up, and the network started working again. I decided to connect it as an access point. It was there where I found the main problem. For whatever reason, the Ethernet jack labeled &#34;Internet&#34; (where you're supposed to connect the modem to the router) was broken.Needless to say, I'm returning it .
It's a useful phone, and for the price it's being sold at, you can't get much better. Buy a microSD card with it if you want some real storage capacity .
I love these hoses.They are exceptionally well made,not cheap flimsy junk.They are a little heavy but i will take that trade off as i hate untangling hose.I would recommend getting two to attach together for longer working distance .
This drywall lifter works effortlessly.Much easier than the cheap black ones at Home Depot.It does not spin of your foot.Well made and should last a lifetime .
I bought this movie because the ads made it seem hilarious....Marlon Wayans, Cedric The Entertainer; With such funny black people, I thought it would be worth the $20+$5.00 for shipping. Clearly,  I was mistaken....I watched it once and felt my IQ drop 20 points; Yes, it was that stupid. I chuckled slightly for maybe 5 minutes but that's about it...I would rather watch the Sex In The City movie (which I'm sureis awful) with that foot-face Sarah JessicaParker than ever see this again. Don't waste your money .
Works only after maneuvering the cord around until the blue light comes on,.otherwise it will not work properly. I was thinking my phone was charging. Disappointed .
I got this case just in the time frame they gave me . I love the way it feels too. The only thing I don't like is how the built in plastic part is so far from the actual screen. You have to really push down on it to hit the screen. Another thing is the pink plastic part . It looks really cheap like it could break easily ! But other than that the case is fine, I've had it for a week now and no damage yet .
The received and has no use to say in the matter .
Product quality was very good. No problems with pages. Very good read and plan. Would definitely recommend to a friend .
The product looked like it was going to give a realistic look. When I received the product it had a shiny look to it. It did not look realistic at all. On the plus side my kids love it .
It is ok I guess. It does weird things to remove the burns off of the tv. But I have a bigger issue with tv not product. If you have to use this then go ahead. But follow the instructions like it says .
Product quality was very good. Second time I have ordered it. No problems with part. Works like it is supposed to .
Product is very well made. It is not too bulky and it is an exact fit to my Galaxy S5. Would recommend for great protection .
Product seems to be holding u so far. No problem to note. Only had in in my car for about a month. Will give an update as soon as something comes up .
This is exactly what I needed for My Philips TV. It was instant connect. No reprogramming. Makes it easier when you have the right part .
Great move to watch. Kids enjoyed it after seeing it. Product was in great shape. Had no scratches or dings in box. Would recommend to friends .
Part was in great condition. Is working well with the 2005 Hyundai Elantra that I installed it on. Everything went in place with no problems. Will check back in once we put some hours on it. So far would order from here again .
It was not the product that I needed and it said it fits most of the scooters. It was too short and I needed to order a different one. Had to wait again for the other part .
The product quality was great. The only problem that I had with this product was that one of the screw prongs was in the wrong place. It was in a spot where the sim card goes. Had to take some wire cutters and fix it. Got it all in but the screen wasn't what it was suppose to be. It was a different screen. I called customer service and thy were wonderful. They helped me and I was very pleased with the quick response form them .
The product is very cheaply made. The screen protector was a little to big and did not fit. The stylist is very good. Delivery was very good and on time. Over all it it is ok. Just wish the screen protector fit correctly .
Had no problems assembling this. It looks great and is very durable. I would purchase again if I will need another. Very easy installation .
Every thing here was good. Enjoyed the quickness of the order and the shipment. Product was in great shape. The only problem that I do not like about this product is the volume peace is too tight and you have to modify it to work and it still gives you trouble. Other than the volume problem the rest is ok .
I was skeptical about getting this battery at first, but then I ordered it because the price was awesome. So far I hadn't had any problems with it. I would definitely order here again .
Every thing here was good. Enjoyed the quickness of the order and the shipment. Product was in great shape. Liked it. Everything was a perfect fit. the only thing I don't like is it is very reflective when you are using the phone and it shows all the finger prints .
The product looks nice, but really doesn't offer great protection. Especially your camera. There is hardly and protection around it and everything scratches it. It is ok, but could get a better one with better protection .
No problems with it so far. Everything is what it says to be on the description. Backed up to computers and still have a lot of memory left .
Great Product. Was what I was expecting. Quality is great also. Really don't have any dislikes thus far. Would definitely recommend to someone else .
Five star because the movie is great. The product had no scratched or dings in it. The quality was great .
Product was in great shape. It was very bright and it had good quality. It did not fit the part that I needed, but it was a great deal and i would definitely get it again if I had something that needed it .
Reading this book..Each day gives you a quiet moment of introspection.  Buy this book you won't regret it.  It makes a great gift too .
Just extremley disapointed, very large but told i couldn't return due to takingThem out of original packaging. Never ordering this brand again .
I loves this case but it does not stay on my phone anymore. I had to buy others. I would say no to this one .
I have had this case for a while now and it helps with holding onto my phone better and it helps with not sliding everywhere. Love the color .
I love these booties! They are so comfortable and I wear them every chance I get. They are a bit too big for me,but according to the sizing chart I would wear a large. Too big or not I love them .
This product was not really what I expected. It looked liked to colors was put on with markers, and not put on good. The price is a little high due to the quality of the product .
Me and my family loved this product. The shot glasses where very detailed. And the price of the product was not bad at all .
Great way to save money! It was delivered quickly and we have had no problems with it. It has been over a month and we still have 12 rolls . ( family of 4 .
Bought this dress for my 3 y/o for our disney trip and I must say it is adorable! The pictures do not do it justice! It fits children who wear a 2t -4t. I washed it twice now and the glitter is still on the skirt and no threads have come undone. It still looks like it did when it first arrived! I am very pleased with the quality of this dress .
Great episode unbelievable, confusing but if you watched the previous episodes you will be fine...can't wait ro see the next one .
the car charger piece didn't work but other than that everything is good .
The highlights are so annoying it ruins the read, so I cannot give a fair review.  Sue Monk Kidd is a good writer and the subject is interesting, but I don't want someone else's highlights in my book.  And if you touch the wrong place, it takes you to Oprah's comments, which is even more annoying .
I found the book interesting.  Not sure I feel the author was a great writer, but a unique plot.  The pictures are unique to say the least.  I did not feel connected to the characters .
I loved this book it ended just how I wanted it too! Their whole book was wonderful and I could not put it down .
It better then going to the store just pay and get the code on the spot no wait that easy .
I always wanted to buy one but didn't have the cash till I found a nice deal on amazon and I must say it's everything I thought it would be never have played a Xbox before the console is awesome I like everything abut it, online play with Xbox live, watch movies, with cool titles on the Xbox to keep you happy for hours the only thing is that it doesn't come with a Hard Drive & you have to pay to play online but it's well worth it .
I have read about 20 books this past month and this one thus far is the best. With the up a drowns and the hardships of a new and intense relationship was great. Looking forward to book two please read this book you won't regret it .
If your looking for a great love story this is it. Not only is it well written, it kept me up till 12 am trying to finish the book. I couldn't go to sleep without knowing what happend to sophia and Marc. I would so recommend others to read this book, and I hope they love it as much as I did. Looking forward for book 2 .
I live to hate this story I want to slap Mia the whole time.. She is so selfish she can't see anything past her self. All you can think about is how her life is being affected, when she is the problem. Everybody is to be blamed expect her or her dumb brother. The one person who keeps telling her the truth she refused to believe but her lying love sick brother she believes.. This is a case of dumb bitch syndrome .
Low this series looking forward to the next book.... So sad that it ended I can't wait to see what will happen .
I purchased this set thinking it looked cute but didn't really know what to expect. Boy was I pleasantly surprised! Not only is it a beautiful set, it is also the perfect size for coffee or soup. My husband actually prefers these cups for his morning coffee. This is an awesome find .
Luv it!!! :) Can't wait for the next book, The Hunger Games: Catching FireLove the love and the action .
The Main reason for the low score is feeling because I get the feeling that B.O.B. has been dumbing his music down for awhile. Just being a long time fan. I know that he can do better. And if he's looking for a big radio hit it won't be this one. The hooks just not that good. I can see this song doing ok in clubs and it might even do alright on the hip hop charts but it won't make top 25  on the billboard charts .
I can't really review this book as it was a gift, my son however, being the one who got the book claimed it was just what he was looking for .
I used a whole bottle on my boat cover canvas using a pump up sprayer with the cover draped over my wood fence. It was easy to apply and appeared to have pretty good coverage. The cover is back on the boat and has seen several good rains and as to date water has not penetrated the cover yet. I will however apply another bottle of sealant prior to storage for winter for good measure. Highly recommend .
I just wish I had realized that the holder wasn't actually the filter, I saw the filters but due to the lake of scale for the filters they looked way to large to work with the filter holder. When it arrived I then realized I had thrown away a perfectly good holder thinking the filter was a part of the component I ordered. Ordered just the filters and everything is good .
First time I've used a ceramic steel, if you keep your knives up and just need to finish the edge, you won't get much better than this one .
OMG, i deal with acid and was told to stop drinking coffee. I found this coffee, it's the lowest acid coffee available. Great taste and no reflux, I won't drink any other coffee .
I'm sure you all have heard the stories of the Gremlin bells. Well believe it or not it's your choice but I have two bikes and both have bells and I wouldn't ride a bike on the highway without one. But thats just me, always hedging my bets .
Maybe it's just a mental thing, with that said, I really don't care if that's what it is or not. I have felt better wearing the magnets and won't go without it .
I read about a hundred reviews on various systems and the price was not a determining factor for me. I knew what size I wanted and the features I needed and this system fit the bill. The hookup for the dvr to camera's was as simple as pie. The DVR setup was easy enough if you can follow directions. Now the remote access using my iPhone and our iPad was somewhat a challenge. But thanks to the online tech I was up and running in about 30 minutes.The camera are out to a distance of 100' with no problem and 4 cameras cover an acre around my house.The feature I love most is the email alert when someone or something activates the system and you can immediately pull it up on your phone or pad, highly recommend to anyone who is concerned about activity around their property while at home or away .
I wasn't sure what to expect when I ordered my first clad silver bar. The craftsmanship was well beyond anything I could have expected. Matter of fact I purchased several and gave them to friends and family along with the .999 pure silver and they couldn't tell them apart .
These are great  novelty coins, if it wasn't for the stamped (copy) on the coin it would very difficult to know it is not real, love the coins .
The perfect size for weighting the core of a monkey fist. Everything it should be, mirror shine and no flaws .
I really didn't expect a whole lot for the advertised price, I'm pretty rough on glasses so I don't like to spend a lot on the ones I buy. Whow, I really like these glasses. There excellent glasses and solid construction .
Just had to order 2 more jars, some friends came over and I had them try the Guava jelly, ( they never heard of Guava) a dozen fresh homemade biscuits and a jar of Guava later and I'm ordering more. Love it, thanks Mrs Miller .
If your in construction these are a must have. I've had hundreds of equipment keys, always missing the one I need. With this set they may not get you in the door of everything, but you can almost bet you can crank and operate them .
Not as nice as I hoped for, a tap on the small side ( I wear a 7 1/4&#34; hat ) quality is just like a nit, nothing special .
These lamps came as a pair, the packing could have been better, had to replace one of the bulbs which was crushed, not sure how. However the lamps were in perfect condition and we love them. They stay on 24/7 .
Outstanding glasses. Being required to wear safety glasses almost 24/7 these fit so well I forget I have them on. You can't buy glasses this good for this price anywhere. The only flaw is the rubber nose piece, it's held on by two tiny plastic pins, the rubber piece will try to get off every now and then. Not really a problem .
The speakers are perfect for phone use, I can have a comfortable conversation at 60 mph on my bike and the other end doesn't know your on a motorcycle. The music however leaves a lot to be desired. My main interest was the bike to bike communication and the phone so the music aspect is not a problem for me.Don't buy for listening to music, you won't be happy .
My battery would lose power, had a blind short I couldn't find, this quick disconnect did the trick, thanks .
Having owned other backpack iphone chargers and feeling like I was took, I was Leary trying this back up battery. There were a few marginal reviews but as I've learned with my position throw out the bottom and the top and see where the cards fall. This battery fits my iphone 5 so well that you can't see where the battery is joined. The feel of the coating on the battery is great, almost a rubbery feel. I read complaints about the backup battery charges first and the phone battery gets used up first, so what! Leave the battery connected to the phone, plug in the charger in and forget about it. When you phone gets low, press the button on the back and keep on getting on. What the f...Buy the battery, save some money and enjoy battery all day. My phone is in use 90% of the time and it makes it all day .
How can I truly do justice with my words to review what is contained in this book? This account is a treasure for Humanity.I have had the utmost privilege and blessing of meeting Alter in person at his home. I was so very impressed with his vibrant Joy for life, despite the incredible odds he has faced. His insights and wisdom are remarkable. Yet he is so very humble, truly a Angel on Earth. His message is one that should be examined, pondered, and applied to all our lives. Anyone that reads this story will be uplifted, encouraged, and most importantly be grateful for what he or she has. There's a old Persian proverb that says &#34;I cursed the fact I had no shoes, until I met a man who had no feet&#34;. The Shoah (The Holocaust) should never be forgotten. It's lessons of despicable Evil, teach us to watch for and most importantly fight Evil where ever it may be. Evil spreads like a plague of sickness in the land unless treated by Good men and women. As Alter so poignantly put's it &#34;Ignorance is the Enemy of the World&#34;. Be not ignorant, I implore you to read with the greatest desire that your life might be enriched as it has mine by this book. Indeed there were many times when the outside world could have stopped many atrocities during WWII but nothing was done. How can men stand idly by and do nothing when others suffer? It's a age old question. Let me share with you one of my very favorite quotes of all history; &#34;The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing&#34; Edmund Burke. We are responsible to Humanity to do something, to raise up a standard of civility, benevolence, charity, peace, and understanding. So many great minds, souls, and hearts were lost in the tragic Holocaust. We must not let this happen ever again! If we don't educate ourselves we will most assuredly fall for the same traps and prejudices as the Nazi's. Every person should study this book! A account that paradigm shifts your reality! I am so very grateful to Alter for sharing his life with us and helping us to understand such precious truths!To Alter,Thank you for opening my eyes to a greater degree. For helping me increase my capacity for compassion and understanding. Your faith, strength, and spirit will always live on through the countless lives you have touched! Your influence reaches into eternity and will never cease! &#34;How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace; that bringeth good tidings of good, that publisheth salvation; that saith unto Zion, Thy God reigneth!&#34; Isaiah 52:7 I look forward to the day my brother that we are in the rest of God and can put away all darkness among us! Father Abraham, Issac, and Jacob I know are smiling upon you from the Heavens for your great service you consistently give! Love you brother!Shalom,&#1510;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503; &#1492;&#1493;&#1488; &#1496;&#1492;&#1493;&#1512; &#1489;&#1500;&#1489;Jordan Charters .
buying this item i thought it will be great because it will keep my bottles of wine cool. well thats not the case it keeps it cool for about 15min and then it turns to be room temperature; which isn't what i wanted .
all i can say about this item is it looks cheaper then what you would buy in the 99 cents store, i did not use it because it didn't have anything stating what this product was made from, i also wanted to return it and asked for them to send me a return label and they said they dont do that...ooo well i hope nobody makes a mistake and orders from them .
i ordered this item it came to me all rolled up in a very small envelope; it had no packaging or anything i wasn't able to learn more about the product. it looks as if someone just took it out of their kitchen and sent it to me. i wanted to return this is but then i didnt want to pay to ship it back .
The Doll it's just okay, I was expecting the 3 holes more soft, may be different material but I was finding the material especially for the 3 holes no so confortable .
This book Take Control of Your Life:  Escape the Grip of Codependency was very thought provoking and revealed things in my life that I never realized.  A God encounter for my life.  I would rate it a five star.Take Control of Your Life: Escape the Grip of Codependency [ TAKE CONTROL OF YOUR LIFE: ESCAPE THE GRIP OF CODEPENDENCY BY Richards, Dr James B ( Author ) Dec-05-2011 .
I had an amazing experience with my seller of these splendid books. The Pumpkin Patch is the name of the seller I went through and is the only seller you guys should go through. They actually took the picture that is posted. They are not small-sized hardcovers as you will get with some of these other sellers. The exact dust jackets posted as well. Perfect dimensions, great books, outstanding packaging. Arrived two days before expected! Everyone needs to go through The Pumpkin Patch seller for the people looking at hardcovers, as they are fast, willing to answer any questions you have and are honest in what they say they are selling. (Review only for Hardcovers). 6 out of 5 .
I haven't even had a chance to attempt to use these yet, as they just arrived today. But they came in a TINY little bubble wrap envelope and were just stuffed in there, all crinkled up and wadded in a ball with the edges folded over and MULTIPLE giant creases all over the paper and the corners on every single sheet got ripped by whoever stuffed them in the small bag- not to mention it was all stuck to the packaging itself with packing tape which I had to pry apart. If it had at least come rolled up and not folded then I wouldn't have any issues but the paper is supposed to be smooth and crease free. I'm VERY disappointed in this because other products I've ordered from this seller have been amazing and this was just awful. Hopefully they see this review and care enough about their customers to fix their error .
My dog still sheds heavily regardless of the use of the tool or not. Thought it eliminates heavy shedding. Nice tool though. I use it as a comb for her on the occasion. Might not be the tool, might just be my dog. Taking her to vet soon .
i actually wanted her comprehensive study published by APPLAUSE PRESSnOT THIS GENERIC VERSIONSimply not in the league with her original publication .
Seems to be a quality product and is making good bread.  Have no complaints with this purchase. No more words necessary .
Thought it was indeed a bee safe unit but hat would not prevent bee stings.  Should have expected less for the price .
Haven't been able to totally resolve carb problem.  Have re-installed the old carb which is still not working right so will try this one again .
I love this game has. Lots of surprises and great hidden objects. The only problem is if you don't have Google play the updates are slow to come to Amazon .
I loved the graphics and the storyline. Could have kept right on playing endlessly. Hope other is a sequel! Can't wait to play the sequel or to forget enough of the game to play it again. Would recommend to friend that like hidden object/adventure games .
This is one book that had me hooked right from the start. I thought I was good at story telling, until I read this book. I am now using this book to move into the Inspirer quadrant of the Dolan Naidu Story Intelligence model (discovered I sit somewhere between joker & reporter). A reference book for the shelf of any aspiring startup entrepreneur, business executive or manager. If you are a fan of TED talks, you should read this book and you could be delivering your very own TED talk in no time .
When i ordered this book, i expected it to resemble one of my backbreaking engineering textbooks; the ones that are dry and too complicated for their own good. However, when i finally received it in the mail, its thin structure surprised me. To the point where I thought that it might not actually learn anything from it.I was totally wrong, this book has everything for the layman to the professional.Great read. Also check out the videos Bill Hammack makes on Youtube. Very interesting .
It was to stiff, when I put on the phone the first time two opposite corners craked because it is not flexible enought to fit the phone into. Also once you get the phone in, it looses its shape. The corners don't have the snug fit to make the phone feel secured .
i haven't had the battwry in my phobe for too long but so far i havent had any problems. so far so good .
I read Eben's book in a day.. I couldn't put it down and am just processing what I have read.. The reality is though that this experience happened in spirit and for my human mind to grasp this will be impossible. Like Eckhart Tolle says.."The voice of spirit is silence and everything else is just bad communication".. I commend Eben for the great attempt and job he did with explaining this near death experience in human language! It's a lot to take in but it's also like I always knew it. It helped me thread together different stories and experiences I have heard over the years. I am looking forward to the day when my veil will lift and I will be fully aware.. This reality here goes as far as our minds.. But spirit is endless and vast and eternal and that is something I look forward to being in more and more! Thanks Eben for sharing your journey .
This book drew me in from the first page. I felt like I was right there with those girls. I would not recommend this for young readers due to the subject it is about, but for adults who wants to see a glimpse of the harsh reality some girls face, this is an excellent way to do so .
good book although it doesn't cause quite the emotional response intended, therefore making it only depressing. strung out, somewhat lacking .
Being a collector of chucks, I thought hard about buying this shoe - I was not sure of the shoe's craftsmanship as I was impressed only by the picture. I should have known better; converse continues to make great shoes! From the moment I opened the box, I was amazed at the quality leather, great stitching detail and thick laces. I'm so excited about this shoe - I think I'm going to buy another pair - just in case the stock runs out in the future.  Who said "hiking" shoes have to be boring .
This item came quickly. Just as pictured. Love it. No complaints. Color just as pictured. Would most definitely recommend this item .
I was a little nervous about putting on the screen saver,  but I watched the video,  took my time and presto... I did it.  I can't tell that it's on.  Thank you very much .
Mildly entertaining.  Definitely not as humorous as I anticipated. Would not recommend this book except as a brief distraction when needed .
This book is, quite frankly, one of the best stuffed animal construction books I've ever gotten. Not only are there 16 projects, but there are 52 lessons that demonstrate certain techniques beneficial to those projects and when you develop your own. This book leaves no stone un-turned, and if you are on the fence about this book, get it. You won't regret it. And if you've always wanted to make your own patterns or wanted to start sewing softies but weren't sure where to begin, this book is the book for you .
This was my first pair of heels ever. I thought that they were comfy and not so hard to walk in, although after a while I did get a bit wobbly. The quality was on par with the price, but there was only one little thing that bothered me a lot, and that was the loop for the laces to go through was just two cut slits in the tongue and wasn't sewn on. Other then that, I loved it .
This is amazing. I've wanted to stretch my ears for a while, but I was never quite sure where to start or what I'd need. Well, I needn't look any further. Not only do I have the tapers, but I also have single flare tunnels *and* two sets of flareless acrylic plugs. The lube is fantastic and really helped. If anyone is looking for a great, easy to use, all inclusive kit, look no further, this has everything you'll need .
Baby loved them but they are hard to clean. They Also didn't store as much food as I was expecting .
This case is pretty solid all around.  The included screen protector is nice.Like many others I've had some trouble with the corner pieces falling out.  Super glue works to keep them in, but it's a little tricky to get the glue where you need it.This case is also fairly bulky, but that's nothing that I didn't expect.  That's the price you pay for extra security .
This book could have been a bit shorter. Interesting in some sections, dragged in others. Ending wasn't what I expected. Enjoy .
Sad but true. Dogs shouldn't be tethered. All dogs should be loved and cared for as a member of the family. Help the dogs be their voice. Special thanks to the author for getting the point across to children .
Just sucks not work that well. Never loads right and we've after loaded it says I still need to load it. Just did not work week and would not received it .
Just did not perform as expected, sucks does not always work and the troubleshooting is difficult to use. . Would not recommend .
Too many ads just annoying and irritating. Never opens without an annoying ad or advertisement. Annoying all the way around would not recommend .
Does not work that good. Does not seen to allow you to play everything you should be able to and not very easy to understand .
Never works right to many ads, just irritating and annoying.would not recommend to friends. Never loads right and always tho many ads .
We just found the Superyard & received it this week. At night & some other times our 2 house bunnies need to be kept contained & away from danger. We got 2 of these pens to put together for a larger area, & we plan to add more. The space between the bars is enough for her to slip through & him to stick his head out, so we found some great wire mesh shelving to fit flat against the lower half. It's easy to put the fence into various shapes. The Superyard is so sturdy that I can see how a child up to 24 months would be safe if the gate is locked. The fence is attractive in our home, & with the additional fences I can go in with them to play. They love it & so do we. The folding brass-colored fencing we have is not attractive & it doesn't lock in place. It's great to have this really nice Superyard .
We love this toy for our 15-month old son. We have taken it to our vacation in Mexico and he has really enjoyed playing with the bucket and tools. We have not used the sand form yet, but all these things look rally well made and durable. I am also happy that the plastic is safe (no BPA etc.), but also it is made from recycled materials, which is a great bonus to me .
I don't like these diapers. They seem to leak and be smaller than other diapers in corresponding sizes. I have to change them really immediately unless I want her bed to be wet! They are chlorine-free, which is nice although my baby still has a rash .
We bought this bassinet for our City Versa. Our baby is 2 months old and we have used it really extensively. In fact, we use this bassinet for our baby to sleep through the entire day and we push stroller from one room to another, making it a very functional day-bed for our little girl. If we put canopy down, she is much more cozy there than in a crib or the co-sleeper we have and especially in the beginning this was basically be the only place where she wanted to sleep (...or on mommy's lap!).We wonder why we did not think about getting a stroller with a bassinet for our first child - it made our life so much easier and I really recommend it.Pros:- very easy to attach to and remove from a stroller- great canopy and style, nice fabric-  very comfortable- easy to use for walks or for sleepingCons:- I wish it came with some sheets that I could change since we use it so extensively. We put blanket to cover the bottom.- I don't think you can remove the  fabric for wash. It could be a good option to have but washing it with a sponge has worked so far .
I really love this stroller, it is the best purchase for our new baby and almost every single day we say &#34;It is a great stroller!&#34;, and we wonder why we did not think about getting a stroller with a bassinet for our first child. It made our life so much easier. We bought an optional bassinet that comes with City Versa and so far we have used it only with this bassinet since my baby is 2 months old. I will write an update once we use the included seat. Overall I really recommend this stroller!Pros:- VERY easy to fold and relatively light- fits in our trunk easily although we have a relatively small Nissan- great color and style - it got many compliments already!- very easy to maneuver- great basket - it is big and nicely placed- handle is easy to adjust and comfortable ( I am quite tall!)- the hand break is much better than foot break I had in other strollers - so easy to use!- most important: it is comfortable for a baby, my baby girl absolutely loves being in it, and she  sleeps in it most of the time during a day - it is much more cozy for a newborn than any bedCons:- included wheels are great (they ride smooth and are light) but they got bit worn down by little stones that pinched through them a little - it is only cosmetic detail. Probably more sturdy wheels would make the stroller much heavier.- I wish that belly bar was included with the purchase and at least a cup holder or some sort of organizer for a parent .
Me and my friend both ordered these cubes, but I did not get what I ordered. He got the real cube, but I was stuck with a lower class Dayan Cube. It works, but it's not what I ordered .
Likes:-Great Sound-Easy to useDislikes:-The very loud beep it makes before it dies.-No battery monitor so you don't know when it will make the beep .
Ideal frame if you want a frame that appears as a good piece of furniture, and accents your picture, poster, photography or anything really you'd want to frame.  Worth the price, & especially suitable if you use several in different sizes so your framing doesn't look to busy.  Available in different shades.  Fashionable, modern, smooth, & even formal appearance, compatible with any decor.  Completely satisfied .
At first I was kind of scared to order seeing it's coming all the way from Hong Kong. But it was so grease and better than I thought. It's exactly how it looks in the picture and made from a thick plastic which helps protect it from falls. Doesn't slip off easily, and darts in the phone pretty well .
Great book, another great book in the Dresden Files.  Butcher does not disappoint.  Can't wait to see where he goes from here .
I was given this used. So far my son has spent 30 minutes straight playing with. Which he never does for any toy. He is 11 months old and he pulls the &#34;blocks&#34; apart easily and is having so much fun with all the different pieces. So far we are enjoying this toy .
MAde invites for my sons party. Wanted to look like a newspaper. These were perfect. Definitely not white. Everyone was impressed and asked where I got the paper .
This spread is wonderful! I love the cookies and decided to pick it up at Walmart for 4 bucks for one. Its texture is smooth like peanut butter, not thick like peanut butter. Taste just like the cookies! I am addicted .
This was purchased for my son, who loves it! All the furniture at the house is really high so my son does not have much opportunity to pull himself up on things. So this toy has helped him to stand on his own. He loves the blocks.The two things that I do not like is the fact that if its on wood surfaces it will move when your kid plays with it. Thankfully my dad gave him a play mat for christmas and it rarely slips on that. However the right angle and right nudge it will move. Also, the blocks are able to connect to one another except some of them do not seem to click and are lose.  Yet some of the blocks connect perfectly fine.I can say in my 1 year olds eyes its perfect. It is one of his favorite toys and provides so much entertainment for him .
The picture on the web and the actual product are deceiving, This product was a Christmas sale of 50% off and I liked the color combination. However when it arrived I found the material to be thin, it has plastic buttons on it and has some glittery affects to it. It looked cheap. Orignally priced at $52.00 it was not even worth the $26.00 that I paid for it. I returned the product .
Book 1 - Resisting the Bad BoyViolet Duke does an amazing job bringing to life characters you just fall in love with. Sweet sweet Abby has absolutely no idea what she is about to get herself into when Connor comes back into her life. There is no doubt these two are attracted to each other. This book has just the right mixture of love, seriousness, humor and raw sexual tension that you will be completely glued to it. This book won't leave you disappointed.Book 2 - Falling for the Good GuyThis book had me upset. I expected Abby to do what she does but it still upset me. I mean, what's a girl to do after what happened? What would you do?I fell more in love with all of them the more I read. Abby is a good hearted person and someone you can depend on to be there in the worst time. Connor does something unexpected at first but very admirable. *Swoon* Brian has been dealt a crappy hand at life but keeps his head on straight and is a good man.This book is full of friendship, more humor, love and a truck load of emotional-ness! Another lovely book!Book 3 - Choosing the Right ManIf this story couldn't get any better I'd be okay with it, but it is just THAT good!Connor come back and he's not going to just sit this one out without a fight. Brian doesn't plan on letting go of Abby all that easily either. If you are looking for a rollercoaster ride, then here it is.This book is so emotional you feel as one with Abby as goes down the path of making the choice between the man she knows she shouldn't want at all and the man that's been her best friend for ever. I was speechless with the whole story. I couldn't formulate words to describe how I felt, and I was just a reader. In my mind I knew who I wanted Abby to be with but I was hurting for the one she didn't choose. This book I have to say is the best of all three. It was the perfect ending to a wonderful story with beautiful characters .
Brian went through a horrible traumatic heartbreaking loss of his wife.  With just getting over the fact that the next person he wanted to be with after getting over this loss picked his brother over him, he finds he is always the nice guy. He is thinking that maybe he should take on his brother&#8217;s old motto, an affair a month.Tessa would be Brian&#8217;s polar opposite. She dresses is crazy fashion, does whatever she feels at any given moment and isn't shy about saying what she thinks. She is what some would call a workaholic also spending any free time helping her friends and volunteering. Tessa is a baker and understands the way Brian feels about the loss of his wife. Brian suggests they have an affair, she agrees hoping her heart doesn't get involved.I completely loved this story. This isn't a simple love story at all. But a story about unconditional love, hope and a future. I cried, laughed and thoroughly smiled through the entire book .
She did it again. Author Violet Duke has won me over again.Love, Chocolate & Beer was an emotional read. I was all over the place. The characters in this book are ones I feel anyone can relate to. Dani is the owner of a brewpub and also the girl next door. You have Rylan who is the supportive best friend. Luke is the handsome knight in shining armor who comes to the rescue (sort of). Quinn the work-aholic and last you have Xoey the crazy cool friend everyone has.I loved being able to watch these characters fall in love. It was developed not just thrown together. You get multiple points of view in this book and it's very well written. You don't feel like you are thrown all over the place, it flows nicely.I was laughing out loud many times throughout this book, which made me want to continue reading well past 2 AM. I also cried, not ugly crying but there were real tears. All in all it was a book I will gladly recommend to anyone that will listen and I can't wait to read the next book in the Cactus Creek series .
THEY WORK WELL BUT I WAS EXPECTING SOMETHING YOU COULD ADJUST BY HAND AND YOU CAN NOT THEY ARE SET LITTLE DISAPPOINTED BUY THAT THEY WORK WELL BUT WOULD NOT BUY AGAIN WILL GO FOR THE ADJUSTING SET .
were to start? the head lights after installed don't fit flush after a week or so bulbs made the plastic head light cover turn colors and bubble and I would never get any product from them again until they can prove its was a one time thing but very dissatisfied. they look good in the box though .
THEY DO NOT MEET FLUSH AND THE BLUBS TEND TO FALL OUT EVERY FEW WEEKS WOULD NOT BUY AGAIN ITS A PAIN .
THESE LIGHTS WORK GOOD AT NIGHT BUT IN DAY LIGHT TURN ON THE 4 WAYS BECAUSE THE RED LIGHTS DONT SHOW UP AT ALL WOULD NOT BUY THESE LIGHTS AGAIN .
The package came earlier than expected which was a very welcome surprise. As for the product itself, it fits the phone very well and it definitely feels protected when holding it. One small quirk you have to get used to is the lock button. You have to learn to be accustomed to pressing hard, which only took me a couple days. The stand is a very pleasant bonus. I didn't even know it had that! You definitely get a good product and at a price cheaper than other comparable cases .
The game was missing several pieces. A lot of the resource tiles were not printed squarely. They are crooked. This is the second Settlers game I have ordered from Amazon. The first game was perfect. This box just seemed to be a factory defect box. The extension had all of its pieces though .
These flats are definitely not incredibly sturdy, but I bought them for a costume so they do the job well enough for me. The color was darker than pictured. Like other reviews said, the flats run large so I bought a 7.5 when I would usually wear an 8/8.5 .
Downton Abbey has fast become a guilty pleasure of mine, so much so that I've turned many of my friends and family into fans. This is the definitive version of season one. The Original UK edition is the best it gets here in the states. It took me along time and a lot of research to come to this conclusion. The Original UK editions of season 2 and season 3 include the Christmas episodes. So if your a completist and are not a fan of buying a season only to have to purchase a stand alone episode that in reality is the season finale.. Stick to these UK editions .
Was the least expensive on site unfortanetly cologne does not stay on u longer than an hr but on ur clothes for three? Lol avoid this from this buyer bottle was ok but print didn't look 100% aunthentic. AVOID .
Did not fit the phone correctly and the cover broke the first time we tried to use it .
I bought this book thinking it was a good dog story but have since found it to be more of a documentary about dogs and the studies of others studying them along with alot of other boring studies, etc. Thought it was about a dog but instead it was about being bored to death. I've read about 25% and just can't bear to read any more .
I enjoyed this book because it held my interest with the crooked workings which involved even some of our military and those in the military who would have none of it and sought to put a stop to it. It was hard to put down .
I chose The Forgotten primarily because I'm from the Gulf coast area and it's reader  rating. I enjoyed it and it held up a very factual theme. It is a no nonesense, action packed  easy read .
I could not get into this book and dreaded trying so I quit ! The stories seem to go nowhere and make no sense. There was nothing to hold on to but instead me trying ot figure out what the hell I just read .
First of all,..the author is a good writer, however for me the series was a bit too in-depth, confusing, and too complex to allow enjoyable reading. Also, though not typical of my personal self,. These series gave me a sense of constant clostaphobia and made it uncomfortable .
This book was great right from the first page to the last ! It was truly &#34;a joy to read and hard to put down&#34;. The story line was really good and the dragon unique in every way and I can't wait to read this author's next book ! I'm looking  for it right now. If you enjoy animals, dragons, knights and adventure stories,....this a must read ! My only issue was the editor must have fallen asleep ! I found numerous errors .
This was the third book of the series in a row and I it enjoyed just as much as the others. I plan to finish the Dancy Tales series cause James Best writes a good western with authenic heart. No boring confusing themes. Just good camp fire stories .
Not use to reading a &#34;short&#34; King book but I liked this one. It was a no-nonsense quick read but enjoyable. The ending was a little lack-lusterous .
It was delivered immediatley and is a really nice soft leather case.Not stiff or bulky and very professional looking. It protects my kindle and easy to use. It's so versital and very helpful to set up each time I want to use my Kindle and read in bed. It also angles the screen however is comfortable for me.  Big thumbs up .
Wagon train was a basic good western. I liked the story and the hero was just that, a hero.It was a good book and I will read more from this author. The "editor" however must have been off sick cause he/she simply did not exist in this particular book leaving tons and tons of mis-spells and errors ! I'd fire the editor. lol .
Very disappointing, did not seem very bold flavor. I prefer other Bold products listed for sale. I gave it away .
Ordered to service a R-410a system.  Even though its advertised for use with R-410a it does not have the adapters to fit the R-410a service port .
This product is a great value for its price! It is thick for an inexpensive product and the reversible feature is very cool! The only thing that disappointed me was that it did not have a zipper but the laptop stays in there taut even without one. I am very satisfied .
Great shirt and great size its just like you see it. Don't have any second thoughts just click add to cart and buy this tupac shirt. Best money you will have spent on amazon .
This lamp is use for my Mother who is shut in.  She reads a lot as she on on a fixed income.I wish she could have prime as well but she can't afford it .
He needs to grow in the episodes but instead he is making himself a loaner. There are good story lines but if the lead actor don't grow with the show then.How do you expect people to watch it .
Right now I am having a problem and I hope I have not lost all my data. Other than that one issue the program does what it is intend to do and works great. But be careful when beaming or sharing your files from one phone to another.I hope DataViz will help get my file open from my older phone .
We bought this as a gift and have not gas any feed back as of yet.hope to hear something soon .
I really wish you wouldn't charge for shows that are on TV. Other than that I like the show and would continueWatching it but I refuse to pay for something I can tape.Cheryl .
I love this show  and the way season 5 ended with Jema killing Teara. I don't any of us saw that one coming .
Also I travel a lot to Canada but I can't ever watch anything from amazon I think we should be able to watch anywhere .
I love this app it works like a charm on my kindle fire so i don't know why others are saying it is not i love the updated version i can play rock tac toe and the memes r my favorite i would give this a higher rating .
It actually was good in the first ace but now it automatically locked me out of my account telling me MY account doesn't exist .
I loved It only problem is that I can't update or get the car dealership s for Santa's taskes plz help me with these problems .
At first iwas like imma try it then i didn't get it but then i got internet an  i played an  was lik  oh iget it .
You definitely get what you pay for when your purchase this product... Nothing more. It's plastic. Very cheap looking in person. The paint peels with just normal handling. I drop my phone when I'm drunk a lot, and while this phone offers absolutely no protection to the device.. I haven't dropped it a single time since I've purchased it. The brass knuckle key rings definitely help in that department .
I choose this item because ,this dryer could move easy bacause of the wheels, so you can adust & fit this  STAND Hair Dryer ,comfortable under the customers, this  item only work for 3 mths too, after ,it start giving cool air, i had a professional techition to look at it  and he say it is manifucture problem this is avoiding  my work because i cannot use this item,I need your help, i am very disapointing .
I love this remote. It works really good. Its so easy to use that my one year old was taking pictures of herself with it. You can't go wrong with this product .
Works good. Gets the job done and handles well! I liked it very much! I don't use it as much as I had hoped I would but we'll see .
I loved this and they did what they are supposed to do. My sis in law has bigger nails than I do and none of them fit her thumb, so we had to improvise and I made mine fit better by cutting some of the top off. Other than that, they are worth the money and the wait to get them .
It was sweet, charming, dramatic at times and all around wonderful! I loved the book so much and cannot wait to read more! Amazing author and wonderful series! Definitely recommend this to anyone and everyone .
Battery life isn't the best and it didn't always get the signal causing me to have to push it multiple times. Overall a decent product but could be better .
Great help when setting up to use my bias machine.  No more hand winding the cut fabric strips. :)The winder lets me roll the pressed bias too. :)If it had only been available to buy in Australia.  The freight from the USA more than doubled the cost and then to buy the US/Aus power adapter.But still glad I bought it .
I love this series and very sad to see it end, it is an amazing series with love friends enemies and all the stories I could not put it down .
Started out good but still can't finish it !!!! Man this so not worth buying sorry but just hate it .
I love your books but I was not feeling trik this time, He was talking like a child not like he was in book 1 older wiser and proper. Sorry .
Not bad for a cheap wii game, I found that I am addicted to it now, my dog is rocking, and I'm getting pretty good @ waiting for the blue ducks, something you can play when your alone, the duck call will drive your wife or friends crazy , over all fun for a shooting game .
As I always wanted a laser in my gun, I mounted it , and tried to get it to set on center for 3 hours, I found that one hex screw was not moving the eye @ all, I tried and tried , I gave up, its now a 12$ cat toy , am disappointed in the adjustments. May possibly be ok for a shotgun where you just need to be close with shooting shot shells but as for becoming a tactical sniper not going to happen .
this item would be getting a 4 star...but when this item arrived it had looked like it had been thru a war.....the boxing was taped back togather....and the cardbord backing looked as if it was wet at one time......however the items inside were perfect.. .and had no damage  they were in working condition and have been used many times now .
well probably my fault for not reading more about this product, I have 2 issues , the broad heads are plastic not razors, and all the plastic is not trimmed, there were a lot of pieces that had tabs still attached. Overall this won't even go more than a 16th of a inch into drywall , couldn't imagine trying to hunt anything but a cardboard cut out of a rabbit,also the metal rails fit loosely in the plastic pieces .
great price ,quality product, mounted so simple,couldn't bring myself to buy a 80+$ look alike, thanks for prompt shipping , love the push button /spring action on the legs /super easy to eject them, it would only mount on my remington 597 as forward folding(no big deal .
perfect . best scope i own . no issues . mounted right up . would buy another.using on 22a pistol .works great at 11-18 in .
Item was ok, dart holder is about worthless, and the sling is just nylon wrapped around the blow gun shaft, over all it would be good for hunting frogs or mice nothing more, states 300 fps but its kinda hard to believe that, it is fun to shoot and kinda novelty but always wanted one, so for the price its OK ,so so, maybe my review will change over time .
great .... very great .... very strong...couldn't believe my eyes once i opened the box ..... was better than i expected .
My ones are a little big but they are soooo comfy and wow I do not even feel my balls .
The Mic so so horrible does not work most of the time if you pull it out and  i have big  ears so the headset hurts after 2 hours of wearing but the sound quality is good 7.1 SS is great tho .
Functions Great, Don't get the the SC edition = its just factory overclocked. Overclock It your self & to your liking and system .
Great fit for my GPS roller range bag. Gives more useable space while protecting my guns. I no longer need gun blankets for protection in the bag .
Great product and I haven't experienced any of the problems that I have heard about it. Everything works smoothly and it is very sturdy.  I really like the metal base. I just wish that there was a pressure release on it. Other than that, no complaints .
the case itself doesn't charge. it comes charged, so you can charge your phone once, but the case wil charge for half a second, then stop charging .
This is my favorite perfume. Have been wearing it for years. Get compliments all the time. Mostly from men!! Have given it to others but it doesn't smell the same so they give it back to me. That's OK because it makes it mine .
Great fit! Soft, stays on but not too tight..  Great for young or old! Everyone got a pair for The holidays and immediately took off their shoes and wore their glittery slippers .
These gloves are everything I ever needed. I work at a bar and it's a HANDS ON job. I deal with broken glass A LOT. Let me tell you, these gloves withstood the blade of the sharpest kitchen knife (with which i tried to slice my hand for giggles). Not even a mark left on the gloves. For the price and their function; they were a fantastic investment, worth every penny. I should've gotten some waterproof ones since i deal with a lot of spilled, sticky alcohol, but nonetheless, these gloves are great. They're great for handling broken glass; you feel the sharpness, but it doesn't harm you. The grip on these gloves is also outstanding. They're not bulky or stiff, they handle well, they wash well and they dry well. Overall a very good product .
I liked this book--didn't want to put it down--it keeps you on your toes as what is going to happen--different ending then I thought! I recommend reading it .
I purchased this so I could get some kind of natural cleanse and detox without having to fast. I purchased the 5 day cleanse but haven't had the right time or the desire to fast for 5 days. This one may not be "ultimate" but it works rather well. I took 2 of each tablet in the morning and 2 of each at night. However, you will be hitting the bathroom at some unexpected moments, so keep that in mind! The first day, it may take 3 or 4 hours or more to kick in, but after a few days it's like clockwork. An hour or so after taking the pills and eating, you will hit the bathroom. I would suggest not taking it too late at night because you will wake up and need to run to the bathroom. I made that mistake more than once. So, if you have a bathroom available throughout the day, no long commutes or needing to find a bathroom, then give it a try! I had to stop it off and on because of my schedule, a couple of days off, then started up again. That's a plus for this product too.I feel less bloated, and I don't have bad gas from eating certain foods like usual - iron rich foods, etc. It definitely helps with cleansing the system, but not sure about the detoxification part of it. I'm not sure what signs to look for. I purchased another box to do again after I take a break off of it for a month or so. When I do take it, I eat mostly fruit and veggies, some grains and some lean meat, and a lot of water or no calorie beverages .
This suit is not meant for any kind of performance. Cheap material and looseness in areas that need to be snug would not be ideal for a competition .
Be careful buying this suit. Cheap material and has an odd fit; too baggy in certain spots. Should not be advertised as a competition suit .
The second book was not as good as the first there was all fighting like the whole time and barley a plot .
This book wasn't as good as the fire and frankly very predictable i would recomend this to anyone over the age of 12 .
Amazing product. There is no static interruption when choosing the proper station. Having no cables to hook up when listening to music is so convenient. You will have no regrets buying this product .
Very durable. Stick great and don't peel off by accident or with in time. I installed one incorrectly, and had an edge sticking out, still managed to stay on there until I decided to change it. Great price for what your getting .
Well here is another great story.  I can't wait to read more. It's got my attention so am getting the book .
Not what I thought it was I was very disappointed.  I will be removing this off my kindle fire.  Not to happy .
I'm just as shock as you are right now!!  Because I'm a Richard Humpty Vission fan!  This CD was nothing more than a messy last minute put together jarble of MESS!!!! I'm giving it a two star because their were a couple of times throughout the CD where there was a rythum and it  sounded like it was gonna get down with some good ole dancing tunes. But that thought was shortly lived when the sound was quickly replaced with sounds of  clanking off-beat, no groove noise!! No lie, this CD sounded like a complete MESS! And I was definitely Let Down!  Because I'm a Fan and I bought three of  &#34;Humpty Vissions&#34;  New cds that recently were released , come to find...I barely like one of them!!  What's going on?? He's really changing his music. He should try staying away from all that preaching talk that goes on throughout the CD because that's not music???? That's what you call &#34;Allowing Your Political Views Get the Best of You&#34; Go back to doing what you know best from your early years .......mix music...not political chants .
Great for the  Grandchildren, Little Brothers or Sisters. And Cooks Like a Champ!!! Great gift for Mom, to entertain with when she is making breakfast for the Grandchildren. The kids are gonna Love it!! And the Adults too. My daughter in Law said one of her biggest loves when she was young,  was &#34;Mickey&#34; and how she wished she had one of these when she was little. So, I invited her over for breakfast! She couldn't say no!! And  LOVED the pancakes!!! They looked  AND tasted SUPERB .
All through the movie I kept waiting for it to pick up and it never did. Believe me I really tried to hang in there, but at the end it left me completely bored and TRULY DISAPPOINTED!  I'm sorry to sound so negative. I guess, I'm too honest when I say I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone, even if it were the last movie on Earth and it was the last night on Earth!  Yes, it's that bad...Believe me .
Regarding the advertising for this application, SO NOT TRUE! It mentions how simple and easy it is. I found myself spending so much time just trying to navigate and understand the steps and instructions! And I consider myself a more than average intelligent person, this application was just so terrible!! I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS APPLICATION AT ALL .
These boots were exactly if not more sexy and hip in person than the picture gives it credit for!! Totally SATISFIED!  And now I have to buy another pair for my other daughter, because the Jealousy ran deep when she  saw these boots on her sister. All she kept saying was &#34; Gosh Mom, you've never bought me anything so  PRETTY and COOL looking LIKE THAT BEFORE .
There is nothing else like it! This is a treasure for all those faithful latter day saints actively seeking the Second Comforter .
I just bought this after going through few cases for my s4 and i absolutely love it. Its really light weight and the champagne gold looks really good with the black s4. The case fits really well and it doesn't suffocate my phone like some of the other cases do. The material is very smooth. Overall I like this case because it gives it a classy edge and does not look cheap like a lot of plastic cases out there. I would definitely recommend this case if you are looking for something lightweight and edgy or just looking for a change .
At first I was skeptical about buying this after reading all the reviews about the bubbles and how it was hard to apply on the ipad. Honestly, it was not hard at all to apply this on the ipad air and the bubbles were easy to get rid of. you have to just  mess around with it a little bit. Overall, it fits perfectly and I can't really even tell there is a clear cover on. I would recommend this to anyone and everyone. Its perfect for the ipad air .
After much debate and research I almost gave up on finding the perfect case then one morning I came across this case and just had a feeling this was the one. I watched the video in the reviews and fell in love with the versatility that this case offered. I just got it in the mail today and I absolutely love it. It's not bulky or heavy on the hand. The price is great and you can do so much with it. I love the fact that you can detach the ipad out from the cover. Everything about this case is just right and perfect. I love this product and would recommend it to anyone who is looking for that perfect case for their ipad air .
Great movie based on a great book and a great philosophy.  Dramatic, mysterious, suspenseful and uplifting.  I think that most people feel the way the main characters do but don't express it because they have been told its wrong by their school. or their church or their government.  But in reality, we all get the most satisfaction out of our own achievements .
I have a very difficult body to cloth, so I'm used to buying things a size too big just to fit right. I ordered this a size too big. It fit so bad. The breast area was so large it wouldn't stay up and the stomach area was too short I had to hunch to get the breast part in the correct area. Just such an awkward fit .
Hate this product. I ordered it 4 sizes too big and it was still too small! The metal bones are crap they just flex and pinch your skin. I tried to return it but they expected me to pay return shipping then charge me bogus fees so I wouldn't of even gotten any money back. Now I'm stuck with a $25 corset that I hate and can't fit in to. Save yourself the trouble and do not buy it .
I love the whole Sims series and I have been playing all of them for as long as I could remember. I love this game because it's different from the PC version but I hate it because it's so different. It's in real time so you can't pause or fast forward. It also means that the actions take an actual amount of time, for example if you give your sim a job it actually takes them 6 or so hours for them to go to work. If you tell them to watch a movie it takes them 90 actual minutes to watch it. It's just very stressful, I live a very stressful life and I don't have time to play everyday so by the time I get time to play my Sims are near death. I love the Sims and had a higher expectation for this. If your a teenager with nothing better to do it's probably perfect for you but an adult in the real world it's a little much .
I did one round and it stopped working. I restarted my tablet and then it worked fine. It's actually super challenging. There's a lot of logos I've never seen before .
This did not help out at all. If anything it made the signal worse... I would not recommend this to anyone at all every .
I love this it really works great. I only use it 3 time a weeks and that's all I need. It give me a nice tan (no orange coloring .
I do not know how to explain just that as I started reading it I had no connection with the characters .
If you're a RPG player with kids, this is a great way to introduce them to your hobby. Based on L. Frank Baum's books, characters, and concepts, this is a fun and simple role-play game that really seems to make the most of Baum's ideas. Granted, it's no hack-and-slash dungeon crawl, but the Oz books have a lot of interesting ideas to offer. The author clearly likes the Oz setting and seems to have done some research into the books to make this game.I bought the paper version and it was worth the money. It's not a long book, but the point of role-playing is to use your imagination and I think it accomplished that. It's a great resource for players of all ages to explore the land of Oz. Since the combat is bloodless, it will also challenge longtime role-players to rethink their ideas and actually use their imaginations. As I aid, this is a great idea for younger player who want to have fantasy adventures of their own but might not be ready for complex rules systems or combat laden adventuring .
Four films on one DVD! Every Oz fan should add this to their collection. The films differ in length, but they are well-preserved and look great. These films predate the 1939 musical with Judy Garland and are, quite honestly, nothing like it.  I think I paid around $8 for this and would gladly have spent more for it.I read other reviews that complain that there is no sound and a lot of reading. That would be because these are silent movies from the early 1900's. Despite what the box art would have you believe, they are not in color. I, personally, like them better in black and white. L. Frank Baum himself made three of these films and, since he wrote the books, I enjoyed seeing his work in a new medium where he had control of the production. The 1925 "Wizard of Oz", made after Baum died in 1919, is a completely different interpretation of the story, even going so far as to change some of the characters and plot lines. Fans of "alternate reality/history" storylines might find this to be a fun, if strange, interpretation of Mr. Baum's famous work.My regret is that the 1910 version of "Wonderful Wizard of Oz" isn't on here, but the Oliver Hardy 1925 version is included so I can't be upset about it. Plus, it was on the 2-disc DVD release of the 1939 film(Wizard Oz Two Disc 70th AnniversaryOtherwise, this was a fun trip to OZ through the eyes of the author and a strange re-imagining of the "Wizard of OZ" with Oliver Hardy not being able to blame Stan for his predicaments. If you like Oz stories or silent films, this is definitely worth checking out .
Although Phil Schneider is giving the speech on the DVD, he never really goes into any detail about the so-called alien/human war that he was allegedly involved in at Dulce, NM. I thought that would have been something included since it's mentioned on the box. There is absolutely no evidence to support any claim of an alien &#34;war&#34; or the supposed casualties that occurred. It is only mentioned, briefly in passing, once or twice before he goes back to rambling about technology. This is more of a conspiracy-oriented lecture with little evidence beyond Mr. Schneider's statements. Viewers interested in UFOs will find little, if anything, new. The information is extremely dated at this point (he references the stealth bombers a lot, but still doesn't really go anywhere with the information) and the lecture seems very scattered and disorganized. It's aimed at true believers and not the undecided viewer or the casual viewer. The conspiratorial aspects felt like rambling most of time and more than once I felt the urge to pause the movie to look for some tinfoil to construct a hat with.The only mentions of Mr. Schneider's death and the possible cover-up of it are on the back of the box. It is never addressed in the film itself. I thought there would be some form of supporting evidence or discussion of that, but nothing is in there. Making accusations is pointless if you aren't going to investigate it or tell me more about it than a few paragraphs on the box. Where are the Freedom of Information Act requests for the autopsy and police reports? Copies of letters? Interviews with friends and family members that believe that he was murdered? Much like Mr. Schneider's credentials and evidence, those things are not in this film.While the back of the box information is not in the film, neither is any tangible evidence. A few photos from magazines and books and rehashed mentions of covert government bodies that may or may not exist seem to be the only thing in the way of evidence. Yes, he has some rocks, but we never get to see them up close (or even photos of them). The camera operator seems to have fallen asleep during that part because the zoom feature on his/her camera seems to operate rather randomly.Also, the audio is pretty awful at times because it was filmed in what appears to be a community room at a local library or convention center. People occasionally move in front of the camera and the camera operator was, at best, lazy or completely unskilled. An editor would have been helpful, too.If you're not a must-have collector of UFO or conspiracy stories, then this probably isn't for you. Certainly don't pay more than the price of a bad movie. This just didn't add anything new to UFOlogy .
I bought this on a whim. i remembered seeing part of this documentary on the History Channel a few years ago and thought it might be worth watching again. Honestly, I'm glad I did. It was very entertaining and had a lot of information that isn't typically addressed in history classes or other documentaries. Billy Ray Cyrus made for an interesting choice for the film. some people have criticized it but they must not have watched this documentary. I thought he did a great job.If you're looking for another re-hash of the Civil War, this is not for you. It has nothing to do with it. Honestly, I was a little glad the producers skipped that. The Civil War has been covered in a lot of other documentaries and this was not the venue for it.I'd love to see a sequel. I'm sure there are more stories out there that they couldn't fit in. Any history fan or people with an interest in or ties to Appalachia will probably find this to be quite entertaining .
this book is is amazing! I never wanted to stop reading it. there are so many twists and turns. It's amazing .
So, this wasn't really the solution I was looking for... But it most definitely is exactly as advertised. I'm happy with the quality of this product for sure.Affordable guitar storage solution .
So when I first got this mic in, I saw the reviews about the buzzing noise, and knew to turn off AGC. That was the first thing I did. However, there was still the most awful high pitched humming noise in my recordings... Through many hours of research and troubleshooting hardware and software, I found the source/solution by complete accident. My lamp.I'm not sure how the logistics of it all works, to be honest. However, I do know for sure that the lamp in my office being on somehow caused interference with the mic. Turning off my lamp, and disabling AGC made the sound quality excellent. There is still a minor &#34;Air&#34; noise that can be heard in the silence due to the mic's sensitivity, but nothing a little noise removal in Audacity can't fix in an instant.After many hours of frustration and troubleshooting... I find this mic well worth the money. I would absolutely recommend it to anyone looking for a low budget recording solution. And I for sure hope my frustration/solution helps prevent someone else from getting the same headache.TURN OFF THE LIGHTS .
G5 never seems to disappoint with their games. The graphics and storyline always deliver. Look forward to more games as i play them all .
The game seems fun at first but then it's money money money. When you finally open the aquatic side, you will not find DNA unless you spend money. I am so sorry that I wasted my time on this game .
This bingo game is a great break away from the others played on fb. There is no chat so you are not distracted by others comments (usually whining). Has a very laid back feel. Very enjoyable and laid back .
G5 never fails to deliver a great game. The graphics seem flawless and the gameplay is awesome. A must have for your hidden object collection .
It is nice that Amazon Coins are offered for a game made too simple til lv 40..... but seriously, I have no coins and while playing....Dumb. i have hade other Wooga games on my device. Smdh .
Great for passing time but the rocket man hangs up on the gate a lot and you can't kill him forcing you to start over even if you have used charms .
This product arrived quickly, and no problems with the package. I love it and it will make a great addition to my collection .
If you want a case for looks, then this case is fine. But if looking for protection, its not great. The case falls off when phone is dropped. Each piece goes its seperate way. Kinda defeating the purpose of a case. It is cute and bright though. Think Minnie Mouse bow .
I really like this game, but I've been playing level 44 daily, for over a month, and can't pass it. I'm so frustrated. As much as I like it, I might have to delete. Just because it's pointless if I can't pass this level. Grrrr .
Great game, a little hard though! Good graphics, but not easy to figure out answers. I would download more by this developer .
I think it's a little crazy that you pay over 300 dollars for this kindle and they do not give you a charger for it??????They supply a cord but you have to buy the other piece separate for $15.00 .
I had never read any Charleston books before. This book kept me interested the entire time. I will have to ser what others are available to read .
I haven't read books by (sharon  sala)  for some time. I've forgotten how good she is.  I can't wait to read more.  Keep up the good work .
This has been the best book that I have read on my kindle so far. I haven't read anything from this author before .
I have never read this author before. I am looking forward to reading more. Thanks so much for the great suspense .
A really great book, I have never read this author before, but, will again. Thanks .
What a great book. I've never read this author's material before. What a great job. I'm looking forward to more .
Not what i expected. yet a very interesting book. i usually don&#8216;t read books from this era, just goes to show they can be of interest .
This s very very good suspense novel. I truly enjoyed it. I did not know how it would end. Got me. Keep up the good work .
I enjoyed the magazine, I just prefer to read a hard copy, and don't like having to be on the internet to read .
I LOVE this game. There are several layout variations to keep you interested and entrtained and I like trying to beat my best time. As you progress, opportunities become available to increase the variety in layouts. The only thing I haven't liked is one of the layouts tends to reset to the start-up layout instead of shuffling. I have spent untold hours with this game -- and I plan to spend LOTS MORE!!!Get this game .
I've never been a great gardener (I tend to kill my house plants).  But lately I've wanted to try my hand at container gardening on my small patio.  It would have to be something I can move inside from November to April, according to the Association rule.  Will'sbook has uninspired me to, not only try a container garden for the patio, but also a terrarium - something I  haven't  had in years. Thanks, Will .
I chose a 5 star rating because this is just the right size for my pet just choose the right size for your pet and you should have no problems it works great .
Love the songs on the album always have been a Britney Spears fan and this album did not disappoint and love almost every track on it .
This door knob works great on any door that needs a replacement door knob if it doesn't require to be locked .
this hdmi cable is great for hooking up the ps3 to the tv and recognizes the hdmi cable also unlike other hdmi cables that don't work .
I really am addicted to this game. I like everything about it and there is nothing like it. I enjoy playing with my friends .
Too big. I'm trying to secure a pool cue not a telephone pole.  They work but not as snug as I would like .
I could not be more impressed with these cartridges for the price.  I will never waste my money on new cartridges again. These work just like new .
Piece of junk. Broke within two months.  However while it was working it was an extremely effective training took. Many times the vibrations got the job done so the shock wasn't necessary .
not enough mystery, too much sex .
This keyboard rocks!!  But beware, check all the keys when you first use it.  Three weeks after I purchased it I noticed that one of the ALT keys didn't work.  Amazon sent a replacement in just two days and paid for the shipping of the defective unit.  New keyboard works perfectly and I love it!!  Totally worth the money .
Great quality and they look really cool.  Perfect for someone that doesn't want to spend the time sleeving cables.  Highly recommended .
Brene Brown is amazing.  Outstanding insight presented in an easy to read format.  I can't think of anyone who wouldn't benefit from reading this book .
I love the work of Brenee Brown.  It wasn't clear to me that this book is based on research of women only and therefore aimed at women.  Because I'm reading the book as an academic, it is nevertheless helpful for me better understand her later work .
According to my cup measure this machine make 4 cups, not 6.And, the recommended basket filter is sized for 4 cups.Go figure.I have to use espresso in the machine to get sufficiently strong coffee.With regular drip grind, the coffee is watery with little flavor .
Great to finally find there plates online.  They're impossible to find in cobbler shops anymore, except at some shops near military bases or military schools.  They are less noisy than you might think.  Basically they're great to prevent wear.  One word of warning:  They are slippery on very smooth surfaces (especially when waxed).  That's the reason most cobblers tell me they don't carry them .
A completely different jacket arrived with no paperwork.  I've been working on this problem for about a month, but nothing has happened .
I thought I would never have frost-free meat again when Reynold's pulled their bags off the market.  The Ziploc Vacuum Pump Bags work very well with my Reynold's pump and I think the bags might be higher quality .
Sent me the wrong snow globe! I ordered the pink&green one and I received the red one. Not happy about that .
I ordered this phone dock for my dad for Christmas, I did my shopping a tad late so I was super worried it wasn't going to get here on time! It ended up showing up on my porch on Christmas Eve and I couldn't have been more pleased! Good Quality and only for 20 bucks!! My dad loved it .
It was a quick convient way to make somenone's day when your thinkin of them! My brother said it made his day even though it was not a larde sum...it was the thought that he appreciated .
It is great just what I needed to stop the glare outside on the kindle. Last year I wasn't able to use the kindle in the yard or the beach. Thanks very much and well worth the money .
I just receiced my watch. It came well packaged and promptjy. I opened it and to no surprise...It looked exactly as advertised. Looks great. Feels wonderful. As a watch with a wide bracelet and face, It doesn't wear that way. The only downfall was there were no directions on how to set it .So here is my gift to you. The buttons on the left of the face have NO use. It seems like they should be a stopwatch....BUT NO! start with the top right button...hold for a moment then let go and tap bottom right button. It will then start blincking and that's where you can set the watch. first is the hour, then minute, then month, then day, then actually year...so then the time should adjust accordinally. At an amazing price, Who in the hell is going to complain. I can't wait to order many more in the future. By the way, some reviews complain that the watch says LED WATCH on the face, I think it's great! I want people to know what i&#34;m wearing when they think it is cool, sleek, and different. Everyone else wears watches as well. Don't they SAY Rolex, Tag, Bulova, Citizen, Armani, Polo, Chanel....the list goes on and on. Who cares about it when you can look into the LED and Only see yourself. Pretty cool .
Can't say much. However, recipient said it feel off the shoulders. It looks like it would be a tight fit, but not the case .
I just got this item and I am in love, came out the ag looking great, fits perfectly, and the hair feels so natural, I cannot wait to make additional styles wth it. this is a very good looking short wig and I have already recieved many compliments. I just may have to get a backup lol .
I was not too satisfied with this item, It seem to be chea[p because it teared the first day I tried it on. I wouldn't really recommended  this item .
This is not the typical type of book I like to read but I found the writing and the characterization to be excellent.  The story drew me in and held my attention and I would recommend this book for readers who enjoy depth and detail and purpose.  There isn't a ton of exploding action, but there is enough to keep you curious and wanting.  Well worth the price and a very good read .
It makes just enough light to keep me from stepping on the dog but not enough to keep me awake .
I use this every summer for my outdoor shower... will need a new one this year but love it. I did notice that last years bag wasn't made as well as the years before... maybe it was just a bad day...who knows .
I hand sew menstrual pads and have been spending so much more money than i should ever spend on snaps.i now have plenty and don't have to think about it for another little while...and then, hopefully, i will know where to get them again. thank you for your service.mikaela kate .
it is too thin a thread for me... I prefer a more embroidery thread feel and cannot find an organic off white thread that is not really expensive.  I rated the thread 5 star because its a great thread for strength, color and longevity... I just don't like stitching with it .
The use of this product for our Boxer Mix was entirely preventative. We started her at 11 months when shortly after adoption we noticed her bones and joints would click when she'd get up from the floor.She's now two years old and we've never heard a click or pop since. Since she's a larger breed dog, I don't want to risk the chance of painful dementia if I can take steps to prevent it now. She loves the taste and happily eats it day and night with her food .
I'm a 27 y/o caucasian female and have been coloring my hair for about 10 years (early greying in the family). I also have had a &#34;fuzz ball&#34; of hair for 25 years. I always thought it was the humidity (grew up in the midwest) but once I moved to Colorado I learned it was just my hair.For 26 years I couldn't look &#34;presentable&#34; without using a hair dryer or straightener on at least the front sections of my hair. My baby hairs always stood straight up and my curls frizzy.Three months ago I bought this shampoo and have never looked back. My hair is soft, shiny and I receive regular comments on my beautiful waves which are now obtained from 100% air-drying.I recommend this to all my friends and recommend to you if you have a similar hair story .
I have a boxer mix with notorious gas. I started her on this and noticed immediate results. Only once did I make the mistake of not ordering back ups, and we were living with our noses tucked into ours shirt collars until the new order arrived. Never again will I do that!Very gentle on my dogs stomach and she loves them .
I wish I could attach a photo to show my boxer mix covered in hives from head to toe. It was so sad and was luckily temporary. Our vet and I think she has seasonal allergies and her skin becomes very dry and itchy at the change of each season. Luckily this was the only episode of hives and it may or may not be to this product, but I'll never risk her health to find out.I started her on 2.5 tablets, 2x daily one year ago and have managed to maintain her healthy epidermis season after season. We never, ever miss a dosage and not only is her skin healthy, but her coat has an incredibly beautiful shine that receives regular compliments.We'll never be without this product and will always default to the Vet's Best brand first when preventing or treating ailments for our dog .
This book is extremely dull. The case questions don't really seem to get the idea of systems analysis in one's head. The layout is clumsy and hard to understand, and the book is ridiculously priced. $160? For a paperback? This is crazy; you can do all the research online for free! In all my time of using Pearson, Pearson publishers create boring books filled with typos and overpriced textbooks. Do not buy this book; rent if you need it. You will save /so/ much money!Updated November 7, 2013I am more than halfway through the course, and the book is not very good. It seems to only tell you /what/ the steps are in each chapter, not /how/ to do them. One would think you would need both, but, as with most of the Pearson books, it does not. I would suggest that all users of the textbook use it as told, but be prepared to do a good amount of online research .
This was a great book! Lots of monsters with some history of each creature. The detail was less than the other Dracopedia books, granted that these contained many more creatures, so less detail for each one, but it was great nonetheless. Definitely worth buying if you want to get more ideas for creations. Note: This is not as walk-through as others are, so it will take some time to get used to the layout. Best for artists who have had a decent amount of time in the artistry field, self-taught or otherwise .
This album was great! Soft, soothing songs mixed with rich, full Celtic style melodies makes this a great buy. The only thing I think is bad is Sticks & Stones by Jonsi. I do not think this song should be on this album. It just doesn't seem to fit with the soundtrack, or the movie. Otherwise, I think it is well worth the price .
Looking for answers look somewhere else. Not worth anything much less $1.20, the power of this book is to relieve you of your money not enlighten you. Has a few references of scripture, few being the operative word. Designed for the disparate,as the old saying goes You can't judge a book by it's cover .
.Item not as described came without gel insert, memory foam only. Cushion as described,except for the gel insert which was left out from order. The whole buying incentive was the gel insert otherwise it's just a high dollar foam rubber seat .
N o t as described, Handheld Sketch Stylus Pen NOT included, HDMI CORD was as described  and worked to my satisfaction Why offer the pen as included  as an selling point. obvious deception .
I spect more taking about the experience in the other world, is inetresting but not as incredible as I wish, its ok .
Very good card, holds lots of pics. Fitted into my camera with no problem. Would recommend this to anyone looking for a card .
This station is great!!! Very sturdy and fit with no problem in my home gym. Would recommend this item to anyone who is doing the navy seal workout .
Just another product that doesn't work. I was even more hungry when I took the pills. Dr oz is just another salesman pushing products that don't work .
Sorry, it did not help me. I really tried and followed your instructions..I can't say that I would buy more.It may help someone, but not me .
These lights took forever to get to my house...that being said, it is the ONLY downfall of these great lights. Brightest things I've ever seen for a key chain light, better than your average flashlight, and the best part is I had no idea it came with 10 of them! Obviously the headline says &#34;10&#34; on the item, but I assumed it to just be some marketing number for the brand. I would 100% buy these bad boys again, and would recommend these to anyone who needs a really bright light at night (and at a surprising distance in the day, though I don't know why you'd need it for the day). Lasts a very long time .
The ring of course looks amazing, well worth the price, and is most enjoyable when you feel like walking out all classy. Though I couldn't find out what the rings meaning meant on the gold plated design in the middle. Anyone know .
This knife was amazing when I first got it. It shined beautifully with the Gold on the knife, and weighed quite nicely for hack n' slash practice! I love the fact that it has a hook that attaches to your belt and can be easily carried with you under your shirt. However, that being said I had it on my belt for about 2 hours and from where it originally had no markings on it, it now has a very small bit of rust on the hook. I strongly suggested not throwing the knife for it is for protective use only. I very much enjoy the knife, but couldn't say I loved it due to the rust happening so quickly (I got it less than a week ago.) That being said I would say it is a wonderful knife to look at, but is no doubt just that. Polish it and treat it well .
It didn't work! Visual quality was terrible and the audio wouldn't work. Also, you can't play movies off of iTunes because it for some reason it doesn't support it's format .
I'm no tea expert, but I tried this brand once and it really blew me away. Perfect to pair with jam and crackers. Get your samovar ready folks .
Outstanding charging capacity at an excellent price! Recommend this product for travelers who need to stay wired in. Won't regret the purchase .
At first it was really bad . You couldn't log in or register . But if you try now then you CAN log in /register. They have fixed kik. They updated it too. So just download it and see what YOU get. It looks brand new and updated. I hope you guys all change your thoughts about kik and just doenload it. Trust me . It works now .
I think this app is pretty good. I think this because all the music you listen to plays automatically. It doesn't slow down like most other music apps. It also downloads the music or videos you listen to on your kindle fire hd! I think YOU should download it if you want to have your music in good condition and if you want to just listen to your music on PlayTube or in your personal videos .
My boyfriend got me this hello kitty car seat cover for my birthday and absolutely love it! I was worried that it would not fit my seat at first but it slid on perfect and the material is really soft and sturdy and I have a dodge avenger 08' hope that helps .
I loved this season, it took some time spotlighting the small groups but I appreciated the close-ups. The zombie peril continues to keep us on our toes. Overall this is the best TV series I've seen in a very long time, I just can't get enough of it .
I am going to start by saying I am using a Phenom II X6 1055T, so I do not know if FX processors will have the same issue I have. I also cam from a Gigabyte 890FXA-UD5 looking to upgrade to Vishera on the cheap.Pros:It is actually a nice board, I like the layout and the extended ESP12V power connector make plugging in the power connector very easy. The color scheme is also nice. As far as functionality, installation was really smooth, I had Windows 8.1 installed on a RAID 0 config and the RAID did not have to be rebuilt! Simply enabling RAID in the EFI interface did the trick. Overclocking is as good as it was on my Gigabyte 890FXA-UD5 running a baseclock of 250 for 3.5Ghz CPU clock speed was no problem (tried at 265 and was also succesful however my CPU was never able to do 3.7Ghz stable, 3.64 max). The UEFI interface is pleasant to behold and easy enough to navigate and loaded with options for overclocking (minus a few important one, but more on that in the cons).Cons:My biggest concern with this motherboard, is the UEFI BIOS. It certainly takes some getting used to, but there are some rather important features missing.1) I am missing CPU multi, if I clear CMOS, the option appears but does nothing and no settings will besaved, upon entering the UEFI BIOS again, the CPU multi adjust is completely missing.2) There is no CPU-NB voltage control (you can control the multi however).3) Voltage control, the board does not allow me to reduce the CPU voltage below default and the default voltage is a good bit above my CPU default voltage (default voltage is 1.375 but 1.428 is the lowest option, voltage will go lower for different power states however).4)when adjusting multi's you get the frequency number with default base clock. EX: you have base clock at 250 and CPU-NB at 2000, the CPU-NB speed is reported as 2000 in UEFI although the actual frequency is 2500Mhz.Conclusion:This is easily a wonderful board and have no doubt it could compete better with other motherboard manufacturers is not for the poor BIOS found on most ECS boards. ECS does not update the BIOS like other major manufacturers (my gigabyte board received 6 and ever option, overclocking or not, worked flawlessly). As it is I am extremely happy with my purchase. I purchased the board onsale for $79.99, amazon had a $12 coupon, and I applied for the amazon visa card and received an additional $30 off, so my after tax investment was $42.07. if not for the low price of purchase the board is not really worth the $120 normal price considering the BIOS issues and you could get a better supported board for just a little more, but if you catch it on sale, absolutely a good deal. So please ECS step up with BIOS functionality .
This product looks great. It fits well in my laptop HP G62. I am using it for last one month and so fare no problem at all. Battery timing is also impressive .
What a great read. I thoroughly enjoyed this very funny account of an actor's experiences in China. 'The show must go on' but in this story it can't go on without mishap, mayhem and mirth. Short and delicious, this is a delightful book. Highly recommended .
The best game ever :) I'm hooked !! I love the game so much I can't stop playing it!!!! I love the collectibles .
The shoes were already stretched out. They put those sticks in them. The fringes were folded. They just throw then in the box. Other than that they are okay. Most likely, I won't order them again .
... despite how repulsive the slavering, rustic fanaticsof the Reaction had become in their violent rejection ofreason. At the end, the sermons of the Holy Machine wereto me - moving and relevant in a way that modern preachersrarely are.The Holy Machine seems to echo a popular skeptic meme of the fundamentalist apocalypse: 'what if religious nut-cases conquered everything', but it goes deeper than that - it explores the real root of belief, religion, and faith with sharp insights that stuck with me long after turning the final page.The robots are used to illustrate the seeming hypocrisy of Illyria, the lone island of reason in a world where the death penalty is seriously considered for the crime of teaching evolution. The athiest-hardliners cannot acknowledge that robots might become sapient, or that rejecting all possibility of the Divine is as narrow as the frothing-mouthed superstitious ravings of the backwards villagers that ascribe advanced technology to the work of demons.The robots too, are vehicles for the main character, and his traumatized mother to rediscover their own humanity even as the Holy Machine discovers its own destiny.In terms of the science that is so important to Illyria, the design and concept of the robots seems logical, and Beckett takes us into the mind of the machine to illustrate a mechanical, alien thought process. Some readers may be put off by the non-human mentality the sexbot Lucy develops, but again... she's not human, she's a gynoid built for sexual pleasure. Although, as a technical note, using real human tissue would be problematic, many veneral diseases could still be transmitted. But the story on the whole works very well. The robots have a logical design, and the story does not depend on giving the sexbot dangerous superpowers that make no sense for her vocation - so common in robot fiction.Robots and humans alike mesh into a work of philosophical potency through a journey of internal discovery. Some other good examples of robots used in this way would be the Fembot series, by D.B. story, or Apocalypse Doll: Reboot, by Xavier Cecil .
...Because the humanoid robot genre certainly has its share of bad ones. Most fembot/android storiesbecome sadly predictable = once it's revealed that the robot (even ones built for sexual pleasure)has the strength of a dozen silverback gorillas on steroids, you know that's going to trigger a chain of contrived events leading to human carnage and a robot uprising. Which argues against making humanoid robots like that in the first place. But alas! Not here! Not Nymph!Suzanne and her ilk are clearly revealed as robots, but without human-threatening superpowers used as devices to force the drama. Of course, some stories go the other way - they say somebody is a robot, but they never really demonstrate any differences from a human being, you just take it on faith. Not here: Suzanne is Solar-Powered, could put a circus contortionist to shame, and if you prick her....well, it's complicated. There is a logic to how the Nymphs are built and how the story flows. And a good dose of real science and anatomy (so many facial muscles!)The plot is driven by human desire, grief, lust and pride - not outrageous super powers; and yet at the end - there is still some threat, some tension and risk, and an evolving character arc that reveals new depths to humans and robots alike. Nymph: The Singularity is a rare gem of excitement, wish-fulfillment, and stimulation (both intellectual and otherwise) Other good eggs in a similar vein would be 'The Holy Machine' by Chris Beckett, and Apocalypse Doll: Reboot, by Xavier Cecil .
Makes having an extra battery easy and affordable so that I don't have to worry about loosing my connection.  Thank you very much .
Was very pleased.  I don't have to worry about white glue messing up my eyeliner cause these add to the liner .
Not the easiest to use until you get used to it.  Then it does the trick and helps to keep the glue off your fingers .
Thanks for the fast shipping and for a great product!  We love that we no longer have to lift her up on the bed and she can do it all by herself .
Cute little puffs, but they leave tiny pieces on your face if you rub too hard... Not as excited about them .
I love my Tivo units.... It was such a great feeling not having to pay a cable bill this month.  I don't know why I waited so long .
Totally can see the whole room.... Makes a real difference when trying to capture a larger area.  I am not the best photographer, but I like these .
Used once so far.  Product is well made.  Nice size handle; substantial feeling...not flimsy. Sharp enough for large dog nails .
Apparently the colour was not what was on the image.It wasn't the grey that is shown in the image .
Does what it's made for no more bulky pockets I just carry this n that's it charges my phone and it's case .
Yasss! Very good product I never have problems with my phone dying this case does the trick good price tooo .
Many reviews have said that they encountered the error "webcam not detected". I had the same problem but finally figured it out and it was very easy.This was on a HP Pavillion PC running Windows 7:Press STARTGo to Devices & PrintersRight Click on the HP Webcam 2100 iconClick TroubleshootIt will detect and correct the problems which are preventing the detection of the webcam.After I did this the webcam was detected by the computer.  And walla!  It is now working.This webcam has decent video quality and features with some video lag.You are getting what you pay for .
I bought this because my driver side mirror was shaking a lot. This is a great mirror and works great too. I painted it with spray cans to match my car and its fine. If you need to take the actual mirror out, just wrap around a cloth on a flathead screwdriver and pull it off. Its really simple, I am not responsible for any damage that can or may occur when disassembling. Cheap great replacement, feels like the original without the paint .
This is just like the original, the bulb that comes with it is the same too. I called my dealership and they wanted $180.00 for both fog lights, they wouldn't only let me buy one. Its a super easy install, on a rating from 1(easy)-10(difficult) it was a 2. The only little hitch i ran into was that the socket for the bulb will make the bulbs connecter face up instead of down like the original. I still got the wire on it and working so it wasn't really an issue .
I bought my phone today. Huge upgrade for me. I love it. I having had many phone calls yet but the sound quality seems great so far. I love the wifi option. It's nice to not get charged minutes for browsing the web when in signal to any open wifi networks. I've had a blast playing with all the settings. The best part to- I didn't have a problem getting my other Tracfone number transferred over. I've heard that Tracfones customer service can be quite irritating but I didn't have an issue whats so ever. I'll update if any problems arise but I don't see that happening .
Totally didn't think it would be a real hens and chick in the pot. But I'm so glad it is. This piece was so adorable, and a must have .
Overall works as advertised, but does not maintain firm electrical contact through the auto plug. Otherwise, the unit works well.  It is also very durable .
chunkier & clunkier & clumsier than expected. the leather looks plasticky, & the ankle strap is too high up so it cuts into your ankles as you walk, REALLY sore. almost unwearable, I am not sure what to do with it now. I had expected CAMPER to be synonymous with comfort .
Although the gameplay gets a little hammered on some Internet reviews, the Puppeteer is still worthy of sitting in your PS3 collection. The production values are truly stunning, you can tell a lot of love went into this area of the game's development. You'll be surprised at what the PS3 can still kick out visually. It won't appeal to everyone, which is a shame- because we need more original games like this- but I love it, its fun, unique and a visual spectacle all rolled into one .
Although the art style is what initially grabs you, make no mistake- the game is fun! I like that it introduces the other characters slowly, instead of throwing everyone at you at once. It kind of reminds of Golden Axe by SEGA. As this generation winds down and big budget game development shifts to PS4 and XBOX One- it would be awesome if more of these types of games started coming out on the PS3, XBOX 360 and Wii U- just like it happened on the Dreamcast with arcade shooters and kept it going (still). Bravo, Atlas .
The book is a great read.  I haven't yet finished it, but the other reviews so far are in line with what I think.  There are several "unexpected" events in the story that shows how stupid people can cause their own tragedies, but as far as I have read, Cord seems to stay on top of his agenda -- besides being somewhat of a "Superman" (with the ladies), he seems to be the guy who is always in control.  His sidekick, a guy called Samuel, may be running the show more than it shows: I can't tell so far.  It has Penthouse "action", airplanes, and fancy cars.  Cord lives the life we all could, if we could afford it.  It's a great story .
The size is not really medium, it is very small compared to the medim sizes of other brands. Because of this I'll have to return it .
As usual, Osiris shoes are da best! I've been wearing them for everything, walking, riding, skating!The perfect pair. Everytime. They NEVER disappoint .
I had to replace the black ink on my Epson WF-3540 for the first time.  I thought that I might need to turn the printer off before I put the cartridge in, but I decided to install it with the printer on.  Printer accepted it immediately just like the original and printer can even read ink levels just like the original.  Ink is great quality and worth every penny!  Hat's off to Blake Printing!!!  If you own the Epson WF-3540, BUY THIS INK!!!  I don't write reviews unless my expectations are exceeded!  There were a couple of cartridges that were not vacuum sealed very well, and the one I used was one of those cartridges and there was no problem.  I am going to vacuum seal the other 2 just in case.  Now I will see how long the high capacity lasts.  I am pretty positive I won't be disappointed.  Either way, you can't go wrong!  I love AMAZON and THANKS BLAKE PRINTING .
I love Alton and this book doesn't disappoint! He has done all the reseach about kitchen &#34;gear&#34; and is informative about his reasons for recommending each product. I would recommend this book highly, especially to engaged couples to help in registering for gifts or anyone else setting up a kitchen .
I love how big it is and  It is an exceptional buy for the price! The drawbacks are that it is not as thick as I would like and that you can not flip it over for use on both sides but I knew both these facts when I ordered it so I am extremely satisfied .
I loved this coat!!! Not only did it loook great but it was super warm. Unfortunately, I ordered the wrong size and had to return it. The size I need is on backorder and I WILL reorder as soon as it is available .
I can't believe the quality of this dinnerware for the price and to add to its attractiveness, it can be purchased as open stock in case of breakage. A previous reviewer said that the glaze on the plates is free from any marring, blemishes, and scratches. This is absolutely true!! Also, the bottoms of the pieces are as smooth as the tops so there is no scratching when the pieces are stacked together.  I couldn't be more delighted that I purchased this set .
I wish I had read the reviews before I purchased these shakers. I was so disappointed to discover the tops are plastic; especially since the shakers themselves are quite beautiful. I will pay more to get silver or or at least silver plated tops but I won't keep these with plastic tops. I am returning them .
This dress appeared beautiful in the picture but, in reality its just okay. I did return it but, had no issues with the store .
Does not have any suction whatever, very frustrating. I'd thrown out the packaging, so I 'll just throw this out as well. A complete waste of money. The eureka Easy Clean I bought does exactly what this one promised  to do and does not. Don't waste your money;  learn from my mistake .
Really well rendered image that looks detailed and permanent, but these glove sare fa too tight. I bought another pair of the same brand at another site and they fit well, so  there seems to be no consistency in sizing. Too bad, these are sitting in my drawer unused, I paid too much for that  to happen .
I have tried several solutions to recording from a call phone and this is the only one that has worked. As other reviewers have noticed it is very sensitive so one ends up with some noise, but the caller is audible and that's all I need. I'm using an iphone5 and although the device records as promised which is most important, it is a bit awkward because the jack goes into the bottom of the phone and your grasp on the phone is slightly impeded. Given the longstanding iphone design issue of the mute button being easily turned on by your ear, the awkward angle resulted in m twice losing callers temporarily. I expect this to improve as I become more used to  holding the phone with the recording device attached. I didn't detract for this because it is as much an iphone  issue as a recording-device issues and tangential to the function.I'm very happy with this now and will check back in after a few months to  let you know how the device holds up .
Didn't heat the bottle at all. Maybe I got a dud? I was very disappointed and sent it right back.  Now a few months later I realized my cousin has one and it works perfectly for her...I guess maybe mine had a default .
For cosmetology school I moved from CA to Utah.  My skin got horrible dry patches and I went through several face washes and moisturizers.  Immediately after using this my skin cleared up.  I love that it's mild, unscented, removes makeup easily, doesn't burn your eyes and gives me the most even skin tone I've ever had.  I have tried a few other face washes over the last 6 years and always go back to this one. My husband even started using it and hates it when I try others. I had no idea they sold it anywhere but at beauty supply stores .
We were given a ton of cookie sheets for our wedding and they were terrible.  My mom had these growing up and she's had them forever.  I finally broke down and bought one.  I will never go back.  Worth every penny .

I got this giraffe for my 22 month old boy.  I was a little unsure about the purchase when I opened it.  The giraffe looked a little small, more muted colors than the picture and was of course a little squished from being in the box as well.  I put it together very quickly and easily even though it doesn't come with instructions.  You do have to put a little effort into getting the bolts through the holes of the rocker to bolt them together.  At first I thought the bolts might be too short but they aren't.  You just need to push a little to get them to go all the way through.  After having this for a few days we already LOVE IT!!!  It is cuter than the picture and the perfect size despite my first impression.  My little boy LOVES LOVES LOVES it and rides on it a few times each day.  He rocks it really hard and it is plenty sturdy and stable.  Sometimes he'll slide off the back but just lands on his bum.  It's light weight and easy to carry around.  My son even carries it himself from room to room,  He doesn't usually attach to toys much but seems to have attached to this.  Such a great toy .
I think it worked? I don't know that I'm totally sold on gas drops yet.  I think they may help but some people swear by them. You can find it for half the price elsewhere .
I love love love these and use them all the time.  I've never had bamboo utensils before.  I loved the look but didn't know how well they would hold up.  These have held up great and are so useful and cute .
I love this!!!  I got so sick of taking diapers out to the dumpster all the time.  This diaper pail is as clean as you can get and does not smell when closed.  It's pretty easy to open too so my almost 2 year old can throw away his own diapers.  Some of the diapers are a little hard to push in so you'll probably be washing your hands after each use.  Totally worth it for me.  Makes my life so much easier .
This is one of the few things I've gotten a free sample of and can no longer live without.  It has saved o many of my clothes! Baby's leaking through diapers, foundation etc.  these are incredible .
Perfect for my needs.  Much better quality than what I bought with my first baby.  These will last a long time! I love the stretchy material sides so there's no tearing .
This is a very good basic product and we've really liked it.  I rated it a 4 only because there's nothing fun or exciting about it.  Just a boring black cover.  I also would have liked it to be more sleek instead of the textured look it has .
This is a great product for nursing mothers. I shouldn't rate it a 4 because it was my fault but I was a little disappointed because I didn't pay close attention to the size of it. It was a much smaller bottle than I expected.  It will though be very nice to have a little bottle for on the go .
I think you have to get used to these?  The first time I used this it worked perfectly... The  next several times were a waste. A pretty expensive waste.  A few times it hardly got warm and a few times too hot. I ended up just nursing my baby. It's a little hard because you can't see how much milk is left in the bottle while your baby is drinking unless you take it off.  Not something you really have the time for with a hungry baby. All the bottles were made with refrigerated breast milk.  I think it would be perfect if you figured out exactly how long it needed to heat the bottle.  Not something you would use regularly unless you have a lot of money to spend.  My guess is about 1 hour for 4 ounces refrigerated breast milk to get it warm .
These were great.  If you use these bottles regularly you'll want extra replacements on hand. I wasn't paying attention when I ordered though and got straws that were too long.  Check the size before you order .
This is a great moisturizer that you don't have to apply every few hours to keep the SPF.  Love this .
This is by far the best mattress pad I have ever had. We got it for my son when we started potty training. It has been one of the best purchases I've ever made.  We have washed it time after time after time and it is still in perfect condition.  He has had plenty of accidents and it has never touched the mattress. I am planning on getting this for all the beds in our house. I would def. recommend sizing up. We did and it fits great. I would also recommend drying it on gentle in your dryer so you don't melt the plastic .
Good warmer. Heats evenly and the same every time. Recommended measurements for water are right. My baby likes pretty warm milk so we put extra water in. Easy to figure out how much more to put in though.  Could be faster but that's how bottle warmers are I think.  Much, much more convenient than doing it on the stove. Only used for refrigerated breastmilk. I haven't tried formula .
This cord is amazing! I neve have to worry about it not being long enough! And it has an amazing price! So I say you buy it .
This case is awesome in so many ways! I also love how it is a true functional wallet! I have never had a problem fitting my license and credit cards and cash in it. For all of you who want i strongly suggest this case .
this Bluetooth handset is one of the best handsets in the market, it offer a good sound quality, an impressive battery life.i love it. the only reason i didn't  give it 5 start just because it didn't fit my ear well and i had to order a smaller size of ear buds .
This cover case is the perfect cover case for an Lg Gpad tablet. The case looks premium regardless of the price as I was hesitating in the begening to order as I was worry it might look cheap, I placed the order anyway and I'm glad I did .the cover case looks great and it make my tablet be protected as it suppose to be. the shipping was fast and I got it delivered even before the promessed time .Don't waist time ordering from China as it will take a month or two to get the item.It only took 3 days to get the package. I can only say ORDER NOW .
I had purchased a similar whistle for my kids when they were little and it sounded like a real train.  I purchased this whistle for my grandson and was very disappointing.  It sounds like an ordinary whistle.  Would not recommend this product .
The only reason I didn't give this a 5 star rating is because I have not tried it on my granddaughter's American Girl doll yet.  I am hoping it fits.  The outfit itself is adorable .
Set came and is exactly what I expected.  It was the quality that I expected for the price.  Wish they had not sent the placemat folded over .
When I had received this I went to put it on my phone and it broke. It's not very durable like the original ones on the apple iPhones . It's almost like it plastic .
very interested romance.. Can't wait for the next part! so looking forward to part 4. the series is very inspiring and you just have to fall in love with all the characters .
I am unhappy with the removable keyboard. I am on the 3rd one. It still is not meeting my satisfaction. The magnets are not in the correct place do it doesn't stick on the case. 1st keyboard worked however it was pink around the edges and looked stained. I am at the point where I want to just return the entire item, but my daughter likes having the case .
Works great with all of my loose teas.  No more loose leaves floating in my tea.  Easy to clean too .
I bought this for my brother who is always... kinda roughing it.  No power usually doesn't really have the money to buy much.  On his birthday I gave him this.  Excited myself I winded it up for just a few seconds and turned it on.  OH MY GOD... bright.  I could only imagine in a completely dark room...  I'm buying another for my hunting trips .
Not entirely my favourite genre but Stella Rimington writes well and convincingly. She probably knows what she's talking about. That's all .
Stella Rimington has so far managed to avoid being repetitious. I hope that she manages to keep it up, though with the reawakening of the cold war that might not be so hard .
Not at all sure about this one. The characterisation seemed forced at times although it was in general a good enough read .
Quality of the products is much better than expected. They are actually solid products and have not turned his skin green and the watch really works well! He is very happy with them! Customer service is very polite and quick to help .
Was way smaller than expected. So small its really not even of any use except maybe as a pencil pouch. It should not be labeled as a school backpack! to small to fit even one school book in .
I didn't give it 5 stars because I still believe A Land More Kind than Home was the best of his books. This book was a story of two girls with dysfunctional parents and what happens to them at a young age. Wiley Cash writes about characters you feel you know in stories that are real. Can't wait to see what he gives us next .
Obviously, I love this shower curtain! After months of waiting to redo my bathroom I couldn't find a shower curtain I wanted anywhere until I came across this one. I just love the simplicity and the modern vintage feel of it. Worth every penny, I found it expensive but worth it when I got it. A little shorter than I thought and you have to wash it then pull the loose fibers off but it's perfect for me .
The Soda Stream came in quickly and worked exactly like it was expected to. I used it for several weeks, drinking 2 of the 1 liter bottles a day and at first there were no problems. After I week it started making me feel shaky and kind of wired, like an energy drink. I thought maybe it was just my body adjusting but by the third week I was disoriented, unable to concentrate, and after doing some research saw where the syrup has been linked, in a small amount of people,  to severe drops in blood pressure. After researching low blood pressure it matched all the issues I'd been having. I immediately stopped using it and after a few days was back to new. I still recommend trying it but just be aware of any changes that you might usually blow off .
This works perfectly. My fiance loves it. I, on the other hand, did not realize how loud this thing is! I love him, just not all of his music =) I definitely recommend this product .
Ok, so let's be honest, most people don't even know what a polaroid picture was, just that it's in a song. Everytime there's a party or get together I bring this and EVERYONE goes crazy over it! The pictures are smaller than the older ones and definitely not cheap (about $1 per picture plus shipping) but I only use it for special occasions and it is so totally worth it .
Before buying this product, I never realized how &#34;dirty&#34; my floors were. Picks everything up and great on all floor types. I would highly recommend this product .
very cool case and sturdy and lovable.  Not the easiest for putting in pocket, but as a novelty that it was purchased for it is awesome .
Cute house, I think the nesters will like it, only there is no way to clean it out at the end of the season.  Need to have a hatch for cleaning .
Ordered a Montana Grizz item , they kept sending me Montana Bobcat product.  Really maddening!  Never could get the shipper to understand the issue,  it was not as pictured,  that it was the wrong color or that it was the wrong team..university.  Really frustrating .
So happy to find this.  I wonder why you don't find this pencil everywhere.  This works great to tame those individual eyebrow hairs that just have to go against the grain.  Just a light coating is delivered with a swipe of the pencil.  Not heavy feeling or greasy.  Completely invisible except for a nice smoothness to your brows .
I purchased this for my mother. Despite being well package,  one of the large drawer sides was broken, Part L4. During the assembly of the main cabinet, we stripped out some of the holes on C and D using an electric screw driver.  This is not hard wood.  My husband does cabinetry so he is familiar with woods of all types.  I am disappointed by the quality of this item.  But my mother is so excited to get a new chest, that we have been trying to find something to fit her needs and taste for nearly half a year, that I am torn as to if I should return this item or not.  If it was for me it would be packed and ready to go .
I received these in a reasonably amount of time. I had ordered two pair, a different color from a different supplier.  So that pair arrived this week.  I like the heather look.  The fabric is very thin, I was looking for a loose but not baggy pant for yoga.  Sadly these will not do.  The fabric even though it feels soft to the hand, when I have the pants on, it itches horribly, I suspect it is the rayon or it could be the poly.  I can't even stand to have them on for more than a few minutes.  The fabric clings, due in part to static electricity I suspect, showing every little unattractive dimple you know where.Somehow I got the idea theses were a cotton blend, but they are a poly blend.  50% poly, 38% cotton and 12% rayon .
Nice simple piece. I like that it is a different font than most initial jewlery.  The chain is shorter than I like, not easy to find a different chain due to the shape of the mount opening on the back of the initial .
Cute little gift, got these to give as Easter gifts to my friends that sew.  But quickly realized they are not meant for repeated use. The rewind button is very &#34;iffy&#34;.  Works doesn't work.  It comes and goes...maybe .
Really wanted to keep these shoes but the straps were really tight.  And no hope of them stretch out a bit due to the material not being natural .
Nice light weight top.  I ordered the Blue/ Turquoise color way.  The top is more dark blue / light blue.  The gold/ tan embroidery is very nice.  I normally wear a large, the elastized waist, is more empire on me. Not sure it would fit like the picture unless I was more of an extra small. The styling and construction allows it to work for a broad size range .
Got these for my husband to wear golfing.  He walks the course,  these really help him finish feeling great.  They work well under his golf pants, no bunching up .
Gave this to my Mom, to help corral and organize all her jewelry that she had stashed all over the place.  Really great as you can see every thing at a glance.  Earring storage, pretty useless unless you are wearing lots of wires.  Thank goodness for the cubbies. Agree with other reviews, the door will not stay shut unless key is in the lock or you keep this locked.  A magnet plate will fix this..FYI.  Drawers are nice, but don't fit nicely, lots of jiggling to get them to sit correctly .
Enjoy the game. I just wish that I didn't have to buy coins. You start out with 25 which is good. The first few shows were easy. I got stuck on the 4th and used most of my coins and then had to purchased coins other than that the game is fun and the coin do not cost much .
As a former Marine and retired Police Detective I found Mr. Cooper 's book to be a complete joy to read. It had all the suspense of  a Clancy novel, and the Gung Ho NESSof Griffin. I started reading and couldn't put it down until I finished.  I will be counting the days until your next release.THANKS AND SEMPER FIbojowhale .
I used this item as a top for my plant stand. We just love it. No issues that I can see .
My boyfriend really didn't think he would like these but now I can't get him out of them &#34;these are so comfortable&#34 .
Ive had this product for about 3 months, the sound is terrific, bass is pretty good. Overall a great pair of headphones, but the bass just went out of them not sure if it was from my handling or just because it doesn't last? I love music more than anything and it was a sad day when the bass went out, not sure if this is a recurring problem or just mine. Just know my bass went out after 3 months i purchase them so be aware it might happen to you .
Highly recommend this product. My husband and I have been researching and looking around for a good, quality ink and this one takes it! We purchased the smaller bottle first to try it out and it is a good, black ink. Not too thin or watery. If you visit their webpage, they have a grand selection of colors, lines, packages, etc. and we'll definitely be ordering this again!The reason I rate this four out of five stars, is because if the ink sits in the cap for an extended period of time, it develops a thin film over the top of this. I don't know if this is true of all tattooing inks, but it doesn't even really pose an inconvenience for us .
Can't really complain to much, it is what it is and works as its suppose to. Great to have the two usb slots for dual charging on my phone and Bluetooth car audio device .
This is a SMALL LIGHT FAST SSD and well worth the money. Just make sure your computer can handle the 6Gb/s Speeds because mine only supported up to SATA 3 so I won't get the full benefits of its blazing speeds. Wish I would have known that before hand but I can always add this SSD to my next machine I plan on getting .
John Starnes - Vol. 2-Greatest HitsThe fact that Jimmy Swaggart has a word or two to say does not bother me, infact I think it adds to the spirit of the song .
I bought the blackberry white 9900 twice and had to send it back d first time the phone it self was faulty I could hear people but no one could her me out of the phone 2nd of all I mailed back the phone and got another blk berry 9900 white with all black asserize I was very very very upset n disappointed because the 1st phone came with all white asserise my over all experience is simply unsatisfied customer point blank .
I bought this because it was a good price, and i needed something to keep my over the knee socks from falling. It lasted through an entire 8 hour school day, plus a 4 hour shopping expedition right after. It came off efficiently, with no pain from pulling the skin like i had expected. I would highly recommend this for anyone who needs to keep socks or other clothing in place .
I love my tablet does everything I need and somethings I didn't know about for price I paid I have regrets getting this tablet its great for school, business, and personal entertainment. Yes I would love to have the better processor for other reasons, I still love this tablet like I said its everything I wanted and more. And I give great thanks to amazon for helping me get this tablet before Christmas when no one or no place in my area had any so thanks you amazon much love &#128077;&#128513 .
Umm this is actually not hand made OR even Steam Punk, this is just the Han Solo toy pistol with a bit of paint slapped on it.Here is the toy Star Wars pistol before the &#34;Artist&#34; put a bit of paint on the toyhttp://www.amazon.com/Spring-Broomhandle-Starwars-FPS-150-Airsoft/dp/B003VZOQYM/ref=pd_sbs_t_10?ie=UTF8&refRID;=1M57TEWWW67VW53NPB6Gfor seven dollars, not over five times that!So my advice is buy a Han Solo pistol put brown paint on it and brush it with steel wool. That`s all the seller did, why can't you .
Great album.  Every song delivers.  I'm not sure this album can be played too loud.  Shooter Jennings has out done himself .
I was excited about this release, and even more excited when it was available on the cheap.  After buying it, I haven't stopped listening to it.  I gave it 4 out of 5 because it's not as good as &#34;Family Man&#34 .
It was 36 DD which is not what I ordered and it's such a pain to return... Waste of my money .
The pre drilled holes did not line up. I ended up striping several screws. In the end I got so frustrated I gave up and returned it .
I ordered a large Beanie boo yet didn't get one! Lies and after my daughter saved up all her money I'm sad .
This product is awful. There was no liquid solution in one speaker and it just broke two days ago. Terrible .
These are amazing and the price is right can't hear outside noise and can not hear music when someone is wearing them .
Walking dead need I say more is haven't seen it yet but you don't know what you're missin you should watch it .
It took a minute to get the with the program but after I figured it out it was all good. Never really saw all of the stuff they were saying about it. (That's just how minor they are. All about learning about the apple world .
I really like this.. it is used with with temperature and not high, med., low.... This is a gift for my daughter in law.  She used mine and loved it .
buenas recib&iacute; la mercanc&iacute;a y no estoy conforme motivado a que las talla son juveniles (peque&ntilde;as) y no para adulta (grande, quisiera devolver la mercancia, gracias .
its perfect on burgers,hotdogs, and sandwiches.You name it and Webers works on it. No household should be without it. Ahmen .
What I really wanted, and could not find on the market, is a weekly calendar. The monthly calendars only add weight to my purse. The weekly calendar is an excellent and streamlined means of tracking appointments, referencing when / where certain events took place and remembering birthdays; I call it my 'brain'. (I keep my calendar books from year to year, and refer to them to look up dates / events from past years; this has helped me out of a bind more than once.) This calendar book is lovely and classic in appearance. If I could find as beautiful a leather weekly calendar book without the monthly calendars -- and with the Hebrew equivalent dates, I would buy it in a New York minute .
Sound was playing through my phone, not through the Bose speakers.  $4, not worth the time and energy to return it .
When I had received the item, First the top portion where the camera is at was pure cracked. Secondly it did not even fit on my iPhone. Thirdly I sent it out and i have not received any refund toward my purchase or even a message. It has been well over 3 weeks. For me, I do not recommend this product to anyone. But You can take the risk if you want. Maybe you will be lucky and receive a good one than a damaged one. Just remember ITS A RISK .
I thought that the glycolic acid would gradually &#34;peel&#34; the skin on the areas of my face that I had applied it to.  It hasn't so far, and the dark spots that are on my cheek, have not faded .
I bought this as a replacement to a small mouse where the left click is starting to go out.  I started using this new mouse and the scroll wheel is simply junk.  You try to scroll down and sometimes it will go down, but mostly it jumps around going down sometimes and up.  It is way too frustrating to use so I've gone back to using my old mouse.  I don't want to go through the hassle of returning it, so it will be in our next garage sale.**Update**I was contacted by Sabrent and they offered to send me a new mouse free of charge.  I accepted and the mouse just came in.  It works great.  Works well without a mouse pad and the scrolling wheel works as it should.  I'm very happy with it.  The first one I got obviously had some problems but now that I received a new one free of charge I am happy.  If my first mouse worked as good as this replacement works I would have been a very happy customer.  If you receive a defective mouse, contact Sabrent as I'm convinced they want you to be happy and will remedy the situation .
We were very happy with our Reindeer Vehicle Costume.  Easy to put on and they stayed on great (we made sure to take the antlers off on the highway just to be safe).  We bought a few of these for several vehicles and made the mistake of buying them for a vehicle that has window vents.  Keep in mind these don't work with window vents.  Our fault for not realizing that.  Oh well, we'll give them to someone else .
Very easy to set up!  I daisy chained a couple of these throughout our house with CAT6 cables and our farthest connection still had gigabit speeds.  We use them to stream movies and music from our network hard drive to other computers and an XBOX and have had no problems.  Simply plug it in and prioritize your connections when plugging your cables into the ports and your good to go!  I love WD products and this is another good one .
After I received my Foscam F19821W camera, I was able to get everything setup within an hour.  The instructions that came with it were easy to follow and the instructions provided on Foscam's website were a great back up (even though I didn't have to use the website).  Very impressed with the video quality, even after going to the WiFi mode.  Camera is very responsive and the two way audio feature is really neat.  I easily set up the remote viewing feature and the video quality is still great even though the response time for turning the camera is a couple seconds behind.  I can still live with it.  I downloaded the app TinyCam to my smartphone and again was able to set it up with ease.  Again, I am very impressed with the quality of the camera and the ease of setting it up.  A great buy for the price!  I plan on getting a couple more down the road .
For some reason these cables are only lasting me about a month before they go bad.  I got them to charge my phone, and after a while they either wear down or something because my phone eventually stops recognizing it's plugged and won't charge.  Then I open a new cord and it works great.  Good thing these were cheap .
These connectors are great.  Easy to attach the cable wires and no crimping trouble.  work great and snap in well .
Seriously, if you need a new video cable for your Wii, get it from this company, mine was here in 2 days, but i live in PA and they are in NY so it will vary depending on distance. The cable came in brand new, cheap priced and works great on my HDTV. My kids love it, and I love it cause I didn't have to spend a lot on it .
Ok, you can get a 4G iPod for as much as this 2G is going for. The 2G iPod doesn't support any newer apps, cannot be upgraded at all. All you can really use it for is Youtube and listening to music on. The 2G iPod isn't even worth $100 anymore let alone $200.The 2G crashes non stop when you try to use the Safari Browser, which is a really bad downfall. Who wants something that doesn't work properly with today's updated websites?8 GB of space isn't very much at all, the Apps that are forced onto the iPod are useless and don't work anymore. And you can't even delete them, another downfall.All in all, it's not worth $200 for an MP3 player .
Ive gotten this power box back in June. It ran fine until a few days ago when it finally blew out. Don't rely on this for a permenant box make sure you save up and get one that is certified. After several months in I had gotten power decrease with my hard drives and other hardware. I ended up having to order a new power box through newegg the other day .
The min. requirements for this game shouldn't be used as a base use for this game. I have an AMD AM3+ 6 Core Black Edition processor at 3.5 GHz, I had to upgrade from a dual core to a 6 core to get this game running. I also went from an Nvidia 9500 GT to an Nvidia 650 GTx Ti boost and now the game runs great on full settings. Also, Radeon cards aren't great to use, to be honest. NVidia is more compatible for games now a days. Trying to use the min. requirements for this game will have you tearing your hair out because of the constant FPS (Frames Per Second) loss. And with newer games coming out anymore, it's better to go big with a PC than to sit there with a crappy dual core board that can't do much at all with today's games.This game is great and fun, at least for me, I love Spider-Man games because of the free world roaming, looking for hidden stuff to unlock costumes, and, yeah the battles can be a bit boring after a while because it does repeat, but the game is great fun. I gave it 5 stars because the game does have a great story line and great play-ability. But the controls for a keyboard and mouse are pretty crappy, so if you have a Playstation USB controller or an XBox 360 controller, it would be better to use that, at least for web swinging and targeting .
Well, I've had this board for over a year, almost two years now gaming on it. Honestly, I haven't had any issues with using Corsair hardware on this board. I bought an AMD AM3+ FX 3.5 GHz 6 Core Black Edition processor for it, 8 GB DDR3 Corsair Vengence RAM, NVidia Geforce GTX 650 Ti, and I haven't had any issues with games running. I do have some small issues with the board, like the video card slots being way too close together. It is a pretty compact board so you're pretty much stuck with that. Other than that, for a motherboard, it's not bad at all. I rated it a 4 because of the performance and the price. I don't go for overclocking anything as you can risk losing your hardware .
I just bought me one of these, it's weird getting used to the keys cause they are a little closer together than my other logitech so it's going to get some getting used to. However, the backlighting of the keyboard is very nice for at night when my fiancee is sleeping and it's dark. The keys aren't loud, but not super quiet. Very nice set up for gaming, But if you're used to a normal set up keyboard. This keyboard will mess you up for a while with games, so my suggestion is to get used to typing on it first before using it for gaming. You'll spend a lot of time hitting the wrong keys lol. Anyways, great for the price, very sturdy, very bright, just wish the lighting was green to match my PC .
tried everything with this recent update to get the game working and I can't even download it. it has no install button on the side. deleted it from the kindle and cloud and it still wont work .
Being that I've actually forced myself to try and play this game for 3 days, I just couldn't stand the slow fighting this game has. It seems like Skyrim on down syndrome. The PC port should not have to rely on a controller. I hate controllers period, which is why I own a PC for mouse use. People told me how great this game is, and to be honest, the graphics are horrible on full settings. The textures are washy looking, the fighting is very terrible, slow, sluggish, boring.On a slight, very slight positive side, it does offer a lot of thinking in the game as far as the fighting goes and the &#34;quests&#34; I guess you can call them. I expected more from Namco as they are an old company and should know how to create newer games, but this game looks like it was made in 2007. I deleted the game just because I couldn't handle how crappy the game play is .
I can honestly say that this is a great album, I just got it in the mail today and already listened to it. I must say if you're a long time Mushroomhead fan or even a new fan, this album will not disappoint you at all. Definitely worth the money!!! Now I can't wait to see them in concert .
Returned. The 2nd port does not always work and when it does the connection is much slower than when connected to only one device .
I needed the model with 4 Ethernet ports so I got another one.  Most of the one's pictured to not show or indicate how many ports are on the device .
It was the wrong size (length) for my existing hydration pack.  It's too long.  These come in various lengths and the images don't help much for deciding which is what so the sizes as well as capacity may need to be indicated as well .
Returned.  This is the model the manufacturer initially recommended to that I purchase.  However once I received it and contacted them I was informed that it was not the correct model and that I could only but the correct model from them .
not happy with this product this product did not fit my tablet too big also usb port not compatible. i purchase thie keyboard case at the time i purchass my unit  this is the one was suppose to be compatible my tablet model is Coby Kyros 9.7-Inch Android 4.0 8 GB 4:3 Capacitive Multi-Touchscreen Internet Tablet with Built-In Camera, Black MID9742-8"i'm still interested in this product if i can receive the right model .
i purchase this unit for daughter birthday she is extremely please with all the features in option my biggest let down  i was sent a key board case that was not compatible to this unit also  do not appeear this unit have usb port if any one know the right model number keyboard case for this product please let me know .
I don't know how this one got by without anyone noticing.  I did and was happy the single was made available.  Like I said, it's another stellar song by Beck .
I loved the book, am anxious to read the next book, and thought it was very well written, but I did not feel as if there was a pay off in the end. I felt the despair of the heroine and longed for a happy ending, day, event, or a happy anything at all for her, but it did not come .
If your a text savvy, you will have no probs with this. If your not.....????? Have fun!!!!!! P.s. love it :- .
Super cheap! And it's a great deal. Took some time for me to figure how to wear it and how it went on because it didn't come with any instructions but for 20 bucks you can't beat it! I googled how it wear it .
the two hearts was the theme we were kinda going for and we are on a very tight budget and these were perfect! and I didn't wanna spend too much on them because its something we will put in and box and prob never look at again. great deal .
great price and the head harness it great and adjustable. i bought this for my husband, his work provided him with a blue one that was no stronger then the hard hat that came in my daughters toy tool set and we just laughed and he asked me to find an ohio state one and when we got this he loved it! great product. highly recommend it .
some of the gems had already fell off by the time I got it in the mail, and when I tried it on my phone it didn't fit right. the one side wouldn't snap together and when I tried to force it more gems would fall off... needless to say I didn't have it on my phone very long .
when I opened the book to take a look at it the seam from the front cover kinda tore off... I plan to revise it a little to go with my country theme so no one will notice hopefully! but also its one of those things that ill look at after the wedding write thank you cards and then put it in a box and never look at it again .
didn't get any cool colors besides orange and the top button on two of them would hold my button down on my phone and try and power it off all the time and i contacted the seller and we settled on him sending a pink one and we would call it even... waited over the shipping time for the first cases to arrive and i contacted him again and he just pretty much said it must have got lost in the mail and asked me to wait 15 more days no big deal i did that and it still didnt come i contacted him again and we settled for a half money back.. so we did that... im ok with the way it turned out because i didnt spend much money on the cases in the first place. but when all said and done i wont be buying from them again .
like all the other reviews they are not very loud bells but they are so cute and a great idea for table favors and great for the price! they are super cute and have room on the back if you wish to customize them a little .
I got this for my friend for Christmas, she loved it!! and the design is very trippy! we both couldn't stop looking at them .
great deal. doesn't come with the inside blue its just all black. when its fully charged it will charge your phone about 50 percent which is great when your in a tight spot and you depend on the phone to last a little longer or if your like me and just don't have time to charge your phone or forget to charge it .
Got this for my mom and she loves it. Great for vacations and camping trips because it protects your phone and has your cc right there so you don't have to take your pocket book. Great buy for only three bucks .
bought this for my hubby and he loved it. great fit and didn't shrink or fade in the wash. looks better in person .
amazing deal and amazing product.i got this for my boyfriend and his phone is always dying but now its not and he loves it.. and he loves showing it off and saying what a good deal we got .
I got this dress for my daughter for my wedding in july and shes 2 now and the only sizes they had was 2 or 4 and shes small for her age so we went with the four and we plan to just get it altered when I get my dress done, as for the looks its so much more great looking then this photo shows! my daughter looked like a princess in it and she loves when she gets to try it on! its so beautiful! if your thinking about getting this dress stop thinking about it and just do it! amazing price also! I didn't expect to find a dress this cheep that I loved! it took me longer to find her dress then it did for me to find mine .
all of our friends are jealous and want one now :) great deal too... my dad was the first to get it and i couldn't handle the fact that my old man had something cool before me and i didnt even had so i found this one and the price was good and works and looks great. it did get to hot and shut its self off once but thats not a big deal it works 15 mins later again and we have it around our tv so its understandable that it got too hot .
the bottle opener really doesn't seem like it would stand up to opening too many bottles but overall its a great buy and everyone notices it and comments on it .
great deal... wasn't sure about the car port thing working very long because we leave it plugged in all the time, but its held up and works amazing .
it is a knock off brand and it feels like it needs worked in, my boyfriend is a gamer and he won't use it but I don't game that much so I think it works just right :) and its my favorite color .
Being that the Galaxy Note 3 had just been released, the availability of decent protective cases was sparse. Thankfully Amazon had this one available, although I did have to go through several pages to find it. There was only one review available (positive), but the case looked solid so I ordered one. It was received in a few days. Fit my Note 3 perfectly. All of the cut-outs are perfectly aligned.Shock absorbing inner shell, fits snugly. Hard outer shell fits greatand sports a decent pull-out stand to watch video. Finally, the case cover offers excellent protection as well as a sturdy belt clip. This is NOT one of those flimsy cases where the materials look bad as soon as you take it out of the shipping envelope.Overall, this case really impressed me because it looks great, offers great protection, and is priced right. In all honesty, I was only getting this case for the interim until a better one came out. However, I think I'm sticking with this case as I'm really satisfied with it .
I bought this in February, and it just died in early march. I didn't do anything to it, but it just broke on its own broke. Don't buy this thing! It is a waste of money .
good price, lots of uses for the product, packaged very well as to not be damaged in transit, worth buying .
this product serves exactly as it should protect cell phone when dropped and stops touch phones from dialing when it shouldn't be .
I purchased this grass seed for my home in northeast PA ,followed the instructions completely, watered almost every day but after 4 weeks there was next to no germination, very disappointed it was expensive and a lot of time and effort to put it down .
its soon to be time to order season 4.....and it can't come out soon enough..too bad it wont be out for christmas .
A really pleasant surprise from the free list, enjoyed it enough to buy the other three in the series, couldn't wait to pick it up at night .
Story expands on the others in the series instead of just more of the same, couldn't wait to pick it up again at night .
Something different in the genre, couldn't wait to pick it up again, whenever I got the chance. Of course even more action should be included .
Not what I thought it was going to be, however, had no problems with keeping on reading. A good free read .
Not as good as the first book, along the same lines, which I suppose a sequel is meant to be, but just didn't get any better .
Not my cup of tea. Others may enjoy it, I found it a re-hash of a thousand other similar books .
Again, a good story, sullied somewhat by the descriptions of the characters emotions, I find myself not reading theses pages, just skipping over them. Sequel is a true &#34;what happens next&#34; book, enjoyed it mostly .
Vampires as villains, who would thunk it. a good story generally. Could be shorter if it weren't for the pages of descriptions of each characters emotions at any given time .
Probably get the next book when it's available. Easy to read, don't need to think too hard to enjoy the book .
Couldn't wait to pick it up at night, really good series, enough action without the usual teen angst crap you usually get .
This item is too small , mabe good for teens or girls but grown man i don't think so unless you are really skinny , Im 6.1 200lbs btw .
Great trucks ! I had a cheaper cruiser and just the trucks axle was a little short so I got this one and now I have no more truck issues .
I ordered this as a Christmas gift and ended up getting the complete wrong product sent to me (what I got wasn't even anything close to a phone case). This left me to scramble at the last minute for another gift. Very disappointing .
I ordered this product a few days before Christmas and wasn't expecting it to be able to be under the tree but it was! The shipping service was excellent! Setting up the drum set was a little confusing but that was to be expected and it didn't take long at all. Overall, it was a great buying experience and there is not one problem with the product .
I live in a 1968 condo building above a smoker. The smoke penetrates my condo unit especially in the bathroom where he smokes at night. Neither this nor an smaller &#34;purifer&#34; clears the smoke.  In fact both just makes it worse in the living room.  Both(Honeywell) models claim to clear the cigarette smoke.  But in fact they make it worse.  THEY ARE BOTH JUST GIANT NON-EFFICIENT FANS.  THE SMALLER MODEL HELPS VERY SLIGHTLY IN THE BATHROOM.  RUNNING THE SHOWER WITH COLD WATER IS THE MOST EFFICIENT .
Very good read. Excellent storyline, great characters, will definitely read more books by this author. Couldn't put it down! Kept me guessing .
The cons - no skin firming observed.  Actually left skin quite dry.  Product is very thick and difficult to squeeze from bottle. A tube or jar would be more appropriate for dispensing. The pros - a little goes a long way and has a pleasant faint citrus fragrance.  With no skin firming, however, product is not recommended for this outcome .
I saw no improvements in skin firmness or tightness.  Product has a very strong baby lotion scent.  Not objectional unless you are not a fan of baby lotion scent .
this product fits the description and is perfect for someone who just wants one of these just to carry his keys because it's not as long as necessary where you don't have to take it off to use open your door. And the black aint in the front begins to chip off pretty easily, but it is heavy duty meaning it does take a lot of banging to it. Depends what you want .
I really like this backpack it's pretty stylish and have received compliments on it. Be aware that it's SLIM meaning it is a backpack meant for only school purposes because if youo try to put something else in other then notebooks and a laptop the item may not fit. Besides that I love this pack .
At first I was expecting more from this product but when it arrived I noticed it had a plastic fan, which isn't as great as a metal fan, so it does what it has too but for a bigger personal computer I don't reccomend this cooler. For smaller laptop its ok it's not great either, but for me its fine .
The jacket fits great and is warm not to mention it is a pretty sweet looking jacket. I believe it is must have for camo lovers .
I loved this book! We're not a military family, but there's still a lot of insight to what makes a good marriage and of course it's hilarious.  I've recommended it to a couple of young marine wives, and it has been well-received by them too .
I loved this book. It was one of the best rock and roll stories I have ever read.  It gave good history and background of the ALlman Brothers Band.  The book had many things I did not know about ABB .
I played this game once before but had it stolen, i've been dying to play it again so i bought it. Just as great the second time around! Always something to do whether its a mission or just flying around blowing stuff up! This will keep you entertained for hours, plenty of guns and vehicles at your disposal. Only downside is you get fined everytime you kill a civillian, so no GTA killing sprees. Just as well, down wanna turn into a homicidal maniac do you .
I bought it for my husband for Christmas. He like it because it was the kind he always used. But they make everything smaller now! The snap doesn't even reach, so he has to leave it unsnapped! Maybe the snap should have been positioned different .
It doesn't work as a diet product. I just buy it for a laxative. I've been using it for years, I love it .
It wasn't made right. To flimsy.  I'm not using it. It does't cover the I-pad firm enough, so it doesn't turn off .
I use it as a laxative not a diet aid. It works wonderful! I drink it every night with great results .
Cute but not very comfortable. A little bit short. I thought it was going to be soft like a slipper .
They are the only candy my son doesn't mind me bringing the grand kids. They don't have all the additives and they taste great .
Nice and light. Has enough around the edges to protect against drops. Red case is absolutely stunning! The paint on the edges does scuff easily though... No biggie .
it's a nice case but constantly attracts dust,no idea why. The only reason I knocked off a star. The window in the back is a nice touch, comes with two optional pictures .
Arrived in the mail with defective screen. Followed the instructions of the operator's manual and have not resolved the issue .
So far, both RCA male plugs have broken and I have had to re-wire a new plug for them. Over all, they were as cheap as the money I put into them. I won't be buying these anymore. If you want to have broken RCA plugs, these are for you .
We bought this stroller for our church toddler nursery room since not everyone is walking yet.  The kids love taking rides in the stroller and the caregivers love being able to stroll four babies at one time.  It was a great investment, reasonable price...just wish I bought this earlier .
I Purchased to use with my Wii. It did not work with my Wii, did not try with anything else .
My son has always been picky with bottles, pacifiers, and sippy cups. So we're always go through a plethora of products until we find one that works. Was really hopeful with this cup and although he can hold and drink from it fairly easy, it's absolute hell for me to open. When I first opened the package I spent at least 15 minutes trying to open it. I eventually had to pass it off to my husband, who is a pretty tough dude, and he couldn't get it open either. After running it under hot water for several minutes my husbands friend was finally able to get the bad boy open but not without a little grunt work. Here I am after one use googling how to open this brand of cup because my only thought was I had to be missing a simple step in opening it. Nope it appears this is a common problem with this cup. My hands are beat red and tender... don't think I'll be getting it back open any time soon .
this is an awesome game!I like it! but there are some that I don't get.wooooh hoooo I like it .
Well might not be their fault but plant very unhealthy,  didn't help ordering coldest day of the years. Maybe.try again .
The price made me look at them. Liked the colors. I use them a lot they go on very easy. They seem to glide on nice, removing is no problem I love them, would order again they do last a long time .
I found this to be like child's makeup, but I wouldn't give it to a child, greasy and does not applie  nice would not recommended .
The case fits galaxy 4 Android phone perfectly. I would recommend to anyone. The price is very responsible, nothing less .
This was a book I owned a first edition of that somehow walked away.  I love this book, but, today, I find it's message even more immediate than it was 20 years ago.  Not only is it a great read, it is told beautifully.  One of my favorite Science Fiction books of all time .
Too much emphasis on examples of what others wrote.  Over all, not a bad start, but, with out being a plagiarizer, has limited use for me .
An even told story of the making a flawed man who the likes of cheny, rumsfeld and rove became the man that never was.  I would recommend this to any and all and, especially, to the tea party to see just how empty everything they have been told is nothing but a ridiculous fabrication .
The wheelchair has considerably helped my dog, he currently have injury on his one leg, so he can't walk well. But since I want him to take outside our home, I decided to have this one. With regards to the benefit that my dog have compared to cost, its very cost-effective. Since i really love my pet, I never mind spending some dollars for him .
I am planning to buy a Kindle to easily access books, and this one might be on my top list. One of its features, the E-ink screen, makes it useful even on bright sunlight.

This is just what I need for my gum problems. I have been having dental troubles for the past few months.

Among all of the products that I've used, it is the only one that really worked. And the remedy is also permanent, unlike the other gum solutions that are for sale in the market .
This is the most effective gum solution that I have ever used in my entire life. All of the others that I've tried have failed to give me satisfactory results. This is the only one that I really like because it helped get rid of my gum problems especially the bleeding. I also like the idea that it is formulated from natural ingredients that make it a safe product. There is nothing more comforting than knowing that your gums and teeth are protected from all possible oral infection .
I loved this book to pieces. To me it's much more real and genuine than the original "The Secret". I think that's the true secret, being aware of the things that do matter and do have an impact.

I always like stories about Hell, and underworlds. This one is no exception. It's dark, very dark. Sometimes so dark that it's hard to keep on reading. But at least I made it through.The book is very well written, and does provide a good experience over all. The story is engaging with some very intriguing personalities, which I think is something this author deserves a big praise for.The negative about this book in my opinion is that it's a bit "too dark", too heavy. It lacks a bit of this "spark" that I really like to see in books like this. Maybe I was a bit sleepy when reading it or something, but it just seemed a tad bit dull at times.Another similar book I read right after this one and liked better isRansom For Hire: Appointment In Hell. This book I REALLY liked and it has a lot of this spark that keeps me wide awake. That's a really cool story so if you are looking for another one after reading this one I highly recommend it .

I think that I am truly getting the real value of my money for this purchase .

I saw that Dr. Oz was really happy with these Raspberry Ketones and I wanted to see if this would work for me too. I am already 45 years old that's busy all the time and I'm about 35 pounds overweight. To be honest I didn't see any results in the first week or so because I would take it before one meal and then forget to take them with my other meals. I was ridiculously inconsistent.The second week however I decided that I really need to make a commitment so I took 2 capsules, which is 500 mg, each day before breakfast and lunch. By the way, so I would remember to take them I would set my alarms at 7:00 am and 12:00 pm on my smart phone to remind myself to take them 1/2 hour before my meals. I'm glad I didn't give up because in only 1 1/2 weeks later I notice that I'm not as hungry at each meal plus my clothes are fitting better after loosing some weight. I'm definitely happy and can't wait to see more results in a couple of months .

I've never been much of a coffee drinker but when I traveled to Nicaragua last month I traveled to the mountain region of the country in Matagalpa, Jinotega, etc & tried some Kilambe and I loved it.

I use it a couple of times per week, it is a terrific cleanser (makes my skin look so much healthier and feels great) and you don't have to mix it up with water or other stuff for it to work .
I cannot believe that this product (Emu Oil) works for burns, cuts, psoriasis, hair care, joint pain, fibromyalgia, chrons, hair loss, arthritis, cancer, aids, polio, haa I made those last three up, they don't claim that.  Who knows, maybe it does, but that would be the most miraculous of products ever, right?  In any case, I purchased it to deal with dry skin and just as a simple moisturizer. I get these small patches of dry skin that look like eczema on the back of my arm pits, maybe from my deodorant, not sure but they can get a little painful, not much but I don't like the way they look and feel.  So, I was told about Emu Oil from a friend and found this cheap one and tried it. It works great and the patches were gone in three days and when I don't treat them they can stay around for a month or two.  After using the "miracle oil" I noticed my reflexes beginning to quicken and I actually felt compelled to run to work (25 miles) and I made it there faster than I normally do in my car, I also found it easier to dodge bullets, scale buildings, and my spider sense was all over more tingly.  I am obviously kidding but that would be cool, right?  I would buy all they had.  Treats dry skin for now. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK .
Among the numerous dietary supplements that I've tried, this is the only that worked for me. I am quite aware that various products have different effects on its users so I'll be speaking from my own personal experience. What made me really happy about this slimming supplement is the fast and satisfying result that I got from it. I have only been using it for around 2 months and I can now see significant difference with my physical weight. It's really great .
I have been taking this for about 2 weeks. I am currently only taking 2 pill a day before meals. Honestly, I do not feel hungry when I take these. I have lost 4 pounds. There are no side effects or any jittery feelings. I recommend this as an appetite suppressant .
This vanity cabinet set is the new highlight in our bathroom. My wife and I both love its clean and fine lines. The glass makes it look more elegant and luxurious. Walking in our bathroom is like walking in a five-star hotel bathroom. I find myself spending more time in this part of the house now more than I did before. I still can't believe that we've purchased this vanity cabinet set at a pocket-friendly price .
This is such an entertaining kindle novel. I really enjoyed it as the storyline is something that I have never read before. Although it is somewhat fictional in nature, I still find myself hooked up to every detail and event. The truth is, I did not notice the time passing as I read through this edition. I finished it in no time as I couldn't put it down. I would definitely read this again and any other novel that the same author has written .
I really love its sleek design, very modern and elegant to look at. It isn't the ordinary sink that anyone would think, with its added cabinets and drawers - it became more useful. It is also very durable, and the color is just perfect, very neat! I'm stil on the process of thinking which furniture should I add on our bathroom - and this one is on my top list .
So after using this product, my wife really loves the effects, actually me too, I couldn't see wrinkles on her face anymore! She then asked me to buy this 5 pairs of collagen masks so she will have more stocks for future use. She (and me) really love this product .
You won't be seeing the effects immediately, but by the 3rd or 4th application, I really noticed some difference on her face.  She now doesn't look as tired she was several weeks ago. She now wants to use this again and again. Great product .
I really want to earn some extra bucks by blogging, but I don't know how to start it. The book has offered me the basics on how can I start earning money while blogging, great stuff .
I'm not really planning to become a full-time writer, but since I love writing, I guess it's time for me to become more productive by using this hobby and earn some income. The book has given me all the basics that I needed in order for me to start it. I just need to apply the learning that I got from here. Great guide .
I've been using this product for almost 3 weeks already, and I must say that it is indeed effective. I already felt a slight change on my weight, not only that, it also greatly improved my mood, as what my wife said. One thing that adds the greatness on this product is its being all natural as I don't really have to worry about possible effects. Great product .
I must say that this is one of the quickest way to lose weight. I have been using this for 3 weeks, and I already noticed a slight change in my weight - thing that other weight loss supplement wants to offer, but never gave. This is the only product that worked for me, and I am really happy about it .
My callers can't hear me talk they said it sounded likebI was in a cave....Very disappointed with the case the plastic is to thick .
I thoroughly enjoyed this book couldn't keep my hands off couldn't put down my kindle. Great mix of fantasy and reality, I wish the ending had more than what it did, but I guess I just wanted the book to go on. Love it .
i bought this because i have very thick hair, but the bristles are so soft that it does nothing to help my hair, i'm disappointed, but for the price, its ok .
I really loved this product for my jewelry i have on sale, however it was shipped to me broken in the middle where they glued together, also the material around it was not stuck properly and you actually saw where it was splitting apart. After a few days it broke off n when i tried to glue it myself the pvc was so soft, it started to break .
the item was described as medium to large birds, however, it is very small, and my parrot doesn't even use it .
if you love to dance and have an idea of his moves you'll enjoy this game, not as easy as you think .
I like the cup no doubt, but i bought it because my baby keeps biting up the spout and cannot yet use the hard ones, this bottle has a longer wear n tear with his mouth,now i have to purchase nipples seperate .
Clip didn't fit on phone and as a result trying to fit it on, the clip broke off. Really disappointing, a waste of my money .
I was saddened to hear that Chris had passed away my thoughts and prayers go out to his family. I gave this movie five stars because it had a lot of suspense, twist and turns also had me guessing the whole movie. The boys are great actors and can't believe they didn't go on the become stars they had the potential to do so. Then a very young John Ridder god rest his sole turned out to be a very great actor and others. I definitely recommend this movie to watch, it had mostly all raving reviews and a few not so good ones but then you can't please everybody but most loved it just fine. I never read the book but anything like the movie I imagine its great don't miss this film MUST SEE .
I saw this movie on TCM you could tell if you watch very closely that Judy Garland looks uncomfortable in her roll.  All in all very good movie, happy someone was thinking about helping mentally disabled children other than just locking them up like criminals, medieval times and it saw not that long ago .
(REGION 2 WILL NOT PLAY IN REGION 1 DVD PLAYERS )  Despite of being region 2 i put in my computer and watched it and this movie rocks ,its funny and good for the hole family .
Just to think that young people go threw that every day around the world yes and even hear in the us. I liked that thay did not suger cote it and told it like it realy is . The sound is not that bad because i am very picky and i still injoyed it watch it and you will fill so sorry for all the kids yes kids that have to wake up to this every day .
I have been wanting to see this movie for a long time so finally I bought .  I i joyed the twists and turns that this movie offered ya it is a little strange but strange is good I would recommend this to watch not a bad flick at all .
I haven't seen this movie in a while what I can remember it is funny for a spanish film not that the spanish can't make funny movies it was very well done I recommend this one .
The is a true story wow that is some Jeffery Dahmer stuff their , A reviewer had wrote that it should have had more victim empathy in it which I will agree with but not to bad just mess up story all together I would not let the kids watch this one  though strictly (MA .
A well acted and directed movie that one could watch over and over again.I will highly recommend this to any foreign movie buff  if you haven't seen this get it you will not be disappointed .
I speek a little spanish so it was'ent all giprish to me but for the most part it was , that a side the plot was very nicely done and a reviewer had said the the picture quality was very poor .  Well all i have to say is that it was made in the 60s and for the age of the movie i did not find the picture bad at all .
Well where do I start , First the obvious is the poverty these people live in and always under the threat of death either by starvation, extremists or collateral damage by the US occupation. One has to stop and wonder if we are doing the right thing  over there . Don't get me wrong I support our troops but we were lied to by the Bush administration about the reasons for going to war with Iraq, but thats way off subject sorry it turned into a political speech . I would like to see an update on how the family is making it along I know this documentary was made in 2004 but I wonder, I tried to look it up on Google but nothing . One can't help feeling sorry for these families just trying to get on with life as normally as possible, Yes it is a very good documentary .
I gave this movie three stars because I think the acting could had been a little better but then again the cast is mostly amateurs so I'm not knocking this film that badly and you might like it better then me I do recommend to give it a try .
This movie reminders me of 400 BLOWS but a little better ,  I Dislike tipping so i'll keep it short if you have not seen this movie watch it you will fill sorry for the kids that had to go threw what they did in that time .
Not a bad movie but it has a couple of holes in it , I would like to know what happen to the young boy did he die or survive .
The reason i gave this movie four stars is not because of the acting , the cast was grate for only being age 8-12 damn good acting it was the plot that made me say wow . Watching this dvd reminded me of a muchroom trip but in a good way I would recamend to you to give it a try and say what you think .
I first saw this film on tv when it came out it is one of those movies that you never forget. I am going to watch it again many years later i'm sure it will be as I remembered if not better .
This movie I think was given a bad rap by some reviewers  but that is my own opinion if you haven't seen the movie I would definitely tell you to try it out .
I read a review that said that this movie was a bit strange well you hit the nail on the head on that one.  Ok don't let that turn you off of this movie because is tha a good plot to it .
When I first seen this movie I was hesitant on getting because I thought it would be lame so I ordered it on Blockbuster. I received it today and played this morning, the quality is not the best but this movie is awesome and a real eye opener to families with special needs children this is a don't miss film .
I bought this movie after seeing Scum this came up on the recommend perches so I bought it.  I can see the similarities in the two, Dog Pound is a more up to date and not too bad I recommend this to buy .
Short and sweet i rented this movie from blockbuster and it was awsome so if you haven't seen it get it i have seen it three times and will watch it again .
I bought this movie for my son how heard about it is school so I decided to watch it he said it was good . I didn't put much faith in it not my kind of film but I was blown away awesome movie I found myself tearing up at the end I won't tell my son that. If you are thinking about getting this movie don't hesitate very good movie. I recommend to others to see it, good for families with handicapped children in general don't miss this gem of a movie thanks Damien Walters the actor who played Johnno awesome job .
I am so glad I bought this movie and for an awesome price too. With out giving up the film I will say I was overwhelmed by the ending very power. After listening to the directors commentary I learned this film had absolutely no budget but ended up being a wonderful independent film. I now have a lot more respect for Ivan Noel. Perfect acting by all the cast. Like I said in my heading you have to see this .
This would have been great if amazon had stated that these boots were not steel toe as they did in their description of these boots.Amazon lied .
Some one told me about it a year ago, I been using it since and I love it, I don't have to worry about any bad smell .
Kindle fits snuggly inside, nothing loose.  Easy access to the charger/usb port and on/off button.  Highly recommend this for Kindle .
I love elemental books.  I heard about this book threw a group that I am with. I'm glad that I chose to read this one. It had the brief love interest ,the suspense. Over all this is a book that I would let my pre teen read. Nothing to graphic but enough to really keep your interest. Love it, going to start the next book now .
Amazing series. !!!!!!!!!!!! Book 3 &4 made me cry. My kids thought I was going nuts.Jessica Sorensen is a amazing writer. Can't wait to read the next series .
This  has been  an amazing set of books. Way better then Twilight!!!!!!!"  Elizabeth Hunter is an amazing writer, and I can't wait to read more from her .
I loved this book.  Out of all the vampire books that I have been reading,they have all talked about finding their "forever" mates, but never really explained it much. This book definitely explained what it was like from vampire  to human and from vampire to vampire. Thumbs up .
Don't get me wrong, I love the cookware but when it arrived, every piece was bent.  Not a great deal, just around the rims so that none of the tops fit snuggly.  The packaging seemed adequate.  I really think it was done prior to packaging.  I am using it, but disappointed .
We love this swaddle wrap!  It works so much better than the traditional blanket.  The Velcro closure gives us peace of mind that he will not break the swaddle. The material is soft and comfortable for little one.  Highly recommend .
These worked perfectly!  Durable and were very comparable to the medala version. Note the shield does not detach, but turns out I preferred that over the detached .
I recommend this book to anyone, once I started to read this book I could not stop until I finished it. My only wish were to have more details told .
I feel like I'm wrapped up in a cocoon when I am in it. I am only 100 lbs. I feel it is missing a part that holds it open. My last hammock had wood poles on each end to hold it flat. But I can't beat the price .
It was a good read, very informative and thought provoking. A little slow at times, and it wasn't something that I couldn't put down or would spend hours reading it straight .
Case looks cool but took a month to arrive and when it finally came, it was broke and cracked and wouldn't even stay on my phone. Don't waste your time or money on this item .
My grand son loves it!He can't reach the ground with his feet yet so mom and dad push the coupe .
It did not work. Returned the product.VERY DISAPPOINTED!Would have liked to really see if the product really works .
I'm a size 7ish so I got the large, it fit well. The material in the front is thicker than the back so make sure to where something that doesn't show threw. Good quality .
I'm usually a 7.5 so I got an 8. But then I realized I clicked for size 6. They were really great for the return. I got my money back no hassle. The 8 I got later fit good .
Jodi never fails - I always know I'm going to enjoy her books. Just can't wait for her to write something new .
I bought an extra battery for me and one for my wife for our safari trip. The batteries that came with the cameras were only about a year old, and did well, but we wanted to be sure we did not miss any shots. These new batteries were excellent. They held charge under heavy use, and only needed charging about every third day .
Warm and cozy,complete cuddle up apparell. Perfect robe topped with a hood. Can't beat it anywhere. My wife is very happy and can't live without it now. Indoors and outdoors, its her go to warm wear. A .
It feels great in my hand, and I like the setup, however the middle three buttons do not work, and the right cursor is read as the same buttons as the actual buttons, rendering the trackpad useless.  It is the same with the left trackpad and the left buttons, making you pick which you would rather have, instead of being able to use a full featured remote .
Absolutely a horrible purchase.  Not only does it need to connect to an ethernet, but it also doesn't come with a backup cable to connect to your own computer.  If I could rate this 1 star a million times, I would.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT .
While it has all the necessary features of a good alarm clock, it constantly will think you're telling something when your not.  For example, my friend opened my door, and Ivee asked me for a command.  This can be very frustrating sometimes.  Also, it does not keep time well.  It loses around 1 minute per week, so you have to reset quite frequently.  Overall, very easy to use, very convenient, with a few things it needs to work out .
When I first got the knife, I was so excited.  The price was great, and the knife looked awesome.  The first thing I noticed was that it was extremely difficult to open using the spring assist.  I then loosened it only to find that the blade wiggles.  So, I tightened it again, and now I can't get the blade in the right place.  Whenever I close it, it hits the side, and dulls the blade.  I have to forcefully push it away from the edge.  The glass breaker also is sharp, and awkward to hold .
I am still reading the book, trust me, Gann is not easy reading. However, compared to the other books I have read of Gann's, this one is definitely THE TRADING COURSE explaining his technique in detail. I would recommend it for any trader grasping to make sense of the moves any market makes. Since this book is titled by Gann as the Master Commodities Course, if you are not already familiar with the basics of his technique, you might read through it at first and wonder, what the hell is he talking about? But if you are familiar with the basics of his technique then this book should shed more light on those techniques and if you follow the rules suggested by Gann, a lot of the guess work normally associated with trading will disappear .
Best cooking show there is! Glad I can view when I want and not have to buy a separate subscription .
I am so speechless w this 1st book. I feel so sorry for Caden. Not only for loosing his parents but for loosing the love of his life and unborn child. Ever might b in comma but she is practically gone. I just can't believe how a love so strong has just changed in a blink of a minute. I sure hope the 2 nd book doesn't have any surprises in store and i sure do want Ever to wake up .
I was so tempted to put this book down a couple of times. But i just kept going and going. I needed to see where all this would end. And wow i was left speechless can't wait to see what book 3 has in store .
There were many obstacle's with this book. I really loved it. I was afraid of what this book would have but at the end i just loved it. Everyone makes mistake's Eden and Cade made a huge mistake in book 2 but in this book 3 they paid for it.  Every day, week and months they paid for it. But at the end it was a great and emotional feeling. I really felt bad for Eden but she did pay the price and it took courage to do what she did. At the end everyone was happy and even Eden got her ever after w Carter what a hunk of a man. Team Carter. Loved these books even though i was so tempted to stop after book 2. I'm glad i finished till the end and didn't judge .
This book had me running up and down! OMG so much drama! Can't wait to read what else Xander has up his sleeves and what will happen w/ Marisa and Liam!!!&#128513 .
I can't believe I am done. I really wanted more of Bass I am totally team Bass. if I was him I would feel the same way. there was times I wanted to get in the book and slap Emma she really needed to grow up. But towards the end I was crying I felt so much hurt for both of them. I hope there is more to their story .
Loved it so much, but i still want more of Bass and Emma!!!! And there more future... Read this book so quick i couldn't put it down and i was reading in class .
WOW, where do I even begin. I couldn't put the book down I wanted to know what other drama was next. I am so ready for the next book. Marisa and Xander have  drama after drama up their sleeves it's crazy. I'm so loving  this series of books .
This book had my feelings for Liv and Grey running up and down. I felt sorry for both of them not just one. Who I couldn't stand at all was that B of Edith how dare she pull that shut on both of them. I wanted to jump in the book and slap her silly. I sure hope they get things straighten out. I would really love to see there happily ever after. &lt;3 &lt;3 .
The case came right away. It fits good. It had no defects. I might get another color. It is hard to get my charger to fit. Will use this company again .
Its nice  & it keeps it much cooler , but beware its pusher dust & dirt in the computer so don't forget to clean you computer with the canned air .
Box is holding up quite well after several hard uses and a few drops. Its been banged around and still going strong. Definitely recommend this, and the storage space under the lid is HUGE, which they don't advertise or show with the product, so that's an added bonus .
Holds a ton, no problems at all after 3 months of use and abuse. Definitely recommend for those who need something sturdy to haul 75lbs or less .
Lasted almost 1 year. Wouldn't buy again, but it did heat water very well. I just wished it had lasted longer .
I was a bit cautious about ordering the 4 piece Ventvisor after reading other reviews that stated the rear visors did not fit correctly.  I have a 2012 Silverado LT extended cab and they fit absolutely PERFECT.  I appreciate the sleek appearance the &#34;in channel&#34; version has, and I must say - installation could not be more simple.  The product comes with everything you need to clean up the window channel for a perfect installation.  And again, my Amazon order arrived WAY before the estimated delivery date... Two days after I ordered it to be exact.  I cannot be more satisfied and happy with this product.  I highly recommend this, it looks GREAT .
FIrst, Amazons shipping seems to always arrive before the projected date.  I like that.  Now, the Curt 13322 Receiver is a fantastic item and the price was too good to pass up.  My review is going to hopefully outline a couple of things I simply didn't know prior to mounting it on my truck.  Most socket sets don't include a 22mm socket unless you're a real mechanic.  I'm not.  Save yourself a LOT of misery and when you order this item at Amazon, go ahead and run to the hardware store and get a 22mm socket.  While you're there, if you don't have at least a 8 inch extension for your socket wrench, buy one of them too.  If it wasn't for running to the store to buy the socket, I would have had this receiver installed in about 15 minutes.  Add in my driving time, and it quickly becomes 45 minutes!  My fault completely.  Why the extension for the socket wrench?  If you don't mind dropping your spare tire, you won't need it.  I didn't feel like dropping mine, and by adding in a bit of length between the socket and the wrench, you will alleviate the need to drop your spare.  At least on my '12 model Chevy, I did not need to trim any fascia as the paperwork suggested may be needed.  All in all, I HIGHLY recommend this receiver.  Installation was a breeze and not time consuming at all.  I'll say pretty much anyone could get under there and do it as long as they have the right tools.  I mean ANYONE.  Plus, as others have said...  this aftermarket receiver actually looks far better than the stock Chevy one. Personal opinion of course .
Excessive Power is a thrilling glimpse into governmental power as you've never imagined. Ms. Brusco takes us into the world of our leaders in such a way that the unbelievable becomes believable. The plot is quickly addicting, and the reader can't put it down. Excessive Power is MUST .
its good i like this game it is a good brain teazer nd its free couldn't have ask for a better app get it .
I bought two of these for my eleven year old boys this christmas. We have other airhogs so we have some basic flying skills and this toy at first seemed very hard to fly and wasn't much fun. We kept trying though and finally figured out the whole launch button on the remotes top left corner and if pressed fast it hops and if pressed and held for a second it goes into a fly mode. If held in it just hops and crashes. So dont start with car on the ground,pick it up and hold it lose in your right hand while holding the controller in the left hand. Now give it just a little throttle not even half way and then hold the launch button for a second or untill the rpm increase and the car takes flight then release the launch button and now you are flying at eye level nice hovering. after doing this a few times you will learn the feel and be able to drive to fly, to land to fly. This is very fun and has much more control then the small havoc heli they sell.We are now able to make this thing drive on the ground then take flight and controle the missle launch and are now getting very acurate with them.The right trigger on the remote will fire the missles when held down.Great toy and very easy to fly once you understand the launch button and how it works. Hours of fun for two eleven year old boys and their thiry seven year old dad .
This book was awesome. I read it in no time. Great descriptions of these epic challenges with beautiful pictures. The only issue I have, now I have way too many endurance goal races .
This workout set is amazing! Paired with Sheila's book &#34;Swim Speed Secrets for Swimmers and Triathletes,&#34; the only way you can not improve your swimming is by not implementing the theories presented. I wish I had bough it sooner .
Love the Garmin cadence sensor. It has helped me to improve my cycling 1000%. Using either my Garmin Edge 500 or my 910XT, I can constantly monitor and train my cadence to be in a highly efficient range. I will not train without it and don't know how I ever did .
I love keo products. The black 0 degree float cleats just are not for me. They bother my knees on long rides. I bought them to try them out as I usually use the Keo grey cleats with the 4.5 degrees of float, which I am personally going back to .
I bought two of these stands and could not be happier. There was absolutely no set up required as they come fully assembled. You just have to push a button to raise and lower the support for either holding a bike or storage when not in use. The bikes are very sturdy when on the stand as well. I can not say enough good things about this stand. Great product idea! Love it .
These are my favorite goggles I have ever owned. I have had around 10 different pairs in the past year alone trying to find goggles that are perfect for open water swimming as well as long pool hours. These do both very well! Couldn't be happier. I have both the silver mirror and clear. I am probably going to buy a few more pairs of each just to make sure I have some in case they stop producing them .
This saddle revolutionized my riding. I would be uncomfortable until I eventually went numb with traditional saddles. ISM's saddles put the pressure on the sit bones. After a few rides I got used to the new positioning and it has done wonders for my cycling. Not only my comfort level but my output! Great product .
Really well made and strong product. I am 6'1 165 and my friends are of similar build. The kneeboard had no issues at all supporting any of us on hours of riding and tricks. A lot of fun and a great progression to wakeboarding .
I have had this saddle five days now. I am already in love with it. It is the second best thing that I have purchased for triathlon. Second only to my TT bike that it is on. After putting the saddle on, I went for an hour ride doing laps around my neighborhood stopping at my house every 10-15 minutes to adjust the saddle until I had it in the correct position for my riding style. Once I got it set up, it blew my mind. I wish I had bought it as soon as I purchased my bike. It was a little different the first ride because all of the pressure is now on your sitbones. Since then, nothing but bliss while riding. Not one thought during the whole of my rides goes to my saddle. Before, with my regular saddle, after about 30 minutes in the TT position it would be uncomfortable, After an hour or so go numb and again around 2 hours become uncomfortable. All those issues have disappeared with the ISM Adamo Time Trial Saddle. I can stay in the TT position all day. Plus, my power output has gone up as well and I am spinning easier. Top notch saddle, I highly recommend it for triathletes and time trial riders .
Great product for the aero concerned long course racer. I am going to save it for Iron distance racing exclusively. I used it at a recent 70.3 I raced and I didn't need the third bottle so it was just wasted weight .
The Aqua Sphere K-180 are my new go to training goggles. They fit well, are comfortable, and do not leak .
Garmin's products are all top of the line and this is no exception. This is my second one. It is recommended that you wash the strap around every seven uses. I train 2x a day 6-7 days a week. I bought this one so I can interchange them when one is being washed. They hold up to washing very well. No issues to date. I have had the first for about ten months and this one for about three. Well made products .
LOVE this hydration system. I own another between the aero bars hydration system as well. However, you have to physically remove the bottle and squeeze to drink from it. I know that doesn't sound like much, but this system makes it so much easier while going hard in the aero position while training or racing. I don't have to remove my hands from the aero bars or change my position in any way to hydrate. Plus, the straw sitting right below my face continually reminds me to drink! I won't go back to my previous system. Just make sure to measure twice and cut once before you trim the straw to your preferred height .
I love these sunglasses. I wear them every day. They are very light and sit well on my face. I don't even think about them once I put them on. Plus, the lenses are polarized. I have not been able to find such high quality sunglasses for a more reasonable price .
My daughters told me they were too old for puzzles. &#34;Your never to old&#34;, I said.  We ended up spending hours of quality time together. The neighbor even came over to help. We bought another White Mountain puzzle recently .
Put together great, except the end wasn't my favorite. I hate when movies just cut off. Otherwise great movie overall .
I really enjoyed this book. I found the imagery to be very vivid however no long-winded. The main character lacked some development, however I go into this in more detail in my YouTube video.I've done an in depth review of this book on my YouTube channel, it's spoiler free though .
This is a good movie with a star packed cast. With many twists and turns you never know what is going to happen next. Love It .
As far as sequeals go this was a good one. and with the returning alum from the first they meshed just fine with the new. LOVE IT. The plot was just as good never knew what was going to happen .
this is a great show love the older episodes mark harmon is one of the best actors ever this is a must see show not a single scratch on any discs .
This item was spectacular there was not a single scratch on any of the discs and it was just what i was expecting. LOVED IT .
What a Trio set. The perfect crime fighting duo in a three movie set. There is no way you can go wrong with these movies LOVE THEM .
