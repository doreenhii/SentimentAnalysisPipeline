The acting was bad, the plot sucked, and nobody actually knew how to play the guitar. I'll give it this, some of the humor was good, but that was the only good point. The music may be considered good by some but to me the songs grated on my nerves and all the background music was cheap and overused. This might be acceptable for kids, but it certainly is not for me. Oh, and cinderella is saddened by this lack of respect to her name."

I have used it to hang many small objects, such as a tv remote, a small alarm clock or even to hide wires unde a cabinet.  The adhesive just does not stick well to anything, except itself.  I have no complaints about the hook and loop side, but it is certainly not anything that should be called &#34; industrial strength&#34; if the adhesive cant even hold up a tv remote,  3M please fix this problem, I know you have better permanent adhesive that can withstand a warm surface, but this product adhesive is a big FAIL."

Avg Acc: 1.0 - "This book caught my eye, and when I read the sample, I was hooked. The final hook was one other reviewer explaining the unemotional aspect of the book's dramatic swings, because of the method of writing employed. (I have often been accused of being unemotional, or anti-sentimental... which is not true. People show these depths of feeling in many different ways--not all of us are weepers, people...) And The Call delivered. The emotion is there, and it's pretty raw at times, but it's emoted in unexpected ways. The characters cracked me up, felt very real, and the story was believable and at times serious, then light, then laugh-out-loud funny. I really enjoyed the writing style, and although it did take a few pages of adjustment, I was very glad I stuck with it. In the same way that Cormac MacCarthy's writing is at first difficult to take in, this was a little bit tough to &#34;get&#34; until I'd gotten through several pages. I have already recommended this to several people. Made me want to try writing again."

He presents his history, how he came to be in the position he's in, how his life experiences (especially outside of America) have molded his expectations and understanding of value and wealth, and he makes a great case with real examples of how simplification is the best way. You'll be changed permanently by how many of your problems are &#34;first-world&#34; type, nothing more. Well worth the read--our culture could benefit greatly by more exposure to, and influence by, this book."

I didn't watch the whole thing with him, but picked up on some good lessons about being yourself and being true to friends. not a morality lesson, but hey--better than lots of garbage out there. he really enjoyed it and went back to see some parts again/show me. he would have watched it again immediately if I hadn't kiboshed the idea...-mom."

I was skeptical when she first asked for them but they are high quality and durable.  She wears them every day.  Also, Amazon prices are better than anywhere on the web - haven't found them cheaper."

His approach to the subject of survival is practical in that he does NOT approach the topic with primitive tool making or cutting trees down to make a shelter. His approach is quick, practical and effective. I highly recommend this book."

Avg Acc: 1.0 - "I just received a set of Japanese Hiragana and Katakana flash cards by Glen McCabe as recently revised by Professor Emiko Konomi.  I am really impressed, both by the low price and by the overall quality and value of the set.  The real usefulness of a set like this is in the way it can facilitate the speed and accuracy of character recognition.  I'm looking forward to using it this way.  The cards are plastic coated, so they won't get "funky" like the ones I made for myself some time ago.  Each card has a series of words written in kana, which aids in the reading of whole words.  One of the most important features involves a high quality CD that comes with the cards.  Using the CD in conjunction with the cards allows the learner to completely avoid using roomaji, and go directly from the Japanese character to the correct Japanese pronunciation.  The 200 cards include the so-called "twisted sounds" as well as the "voiced" sounds.  There are also wall charts of the characters, which, sad to say, I still find necessary on occasion.  For the beginner, such charts would be of great value.  I am currently teaching "Scientific Communication in English" at the Tokorozawa Campus of Waseda University.  I am a colleague of Konomi-sensei at Portland State University and have also been a student in a Japanese class in which she was the instructor.  She is truly a master teacher, and has used her considerable skills to produce a valuable and useful aid in the flash card set."
